    "The [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) was introduced in June 2017. The focus of the original research was on translation tasks. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* June 2018: [GPT](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf), the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results\n",
    "\n",
    "* October 2018: [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)\n",
    "\n",
    "* February 2019: [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "* October 2019: [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), a distilled version of BERT that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT’s performance\n",
    "\n",
    "* October 2019: [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) and [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683), two large pretrained models using the same architecture as the original Transformer model (the first to do so)\n",
    "\n",
    "* May 2020, [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called zero-shot learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "* March 2023: [GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774). The latest version of the GPT series, which is even bigger and more powerful than GPT-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is far from comprehensive, and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into three categories:\n",
    "\n",

    "The model is primarily composed of two blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoder (left): The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.\n",
    "* Decoder (right): The decoder uses the encoder’s representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs.\n",

    "![arch](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter1/transformers_blocks.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these parts can be used independently, depending on the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoder-only models: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as sentence classification and named entity recognition.\n",
    "* Decoder-only models: Good for generative tasks such as text generation.\n",
    "* Encoder-decoder models or sequence-to-sequence models: Good for generative tasks that require an input, such as translation or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The original architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. It mainly consists in these two types of neural network layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-linear perceptron layers: these are the same linear layers we know (it's just a different layer).\n",
    "* Self-Attention layers: these layers take as input the token representations from the previous layers (one vector per token) and learn correlation between tokens at different positions. **This is the key innovation of the Transformer model, as it allows the model to learn dependencies between tokens, resulting in contextual information (the meaning of a word/token depends on the context in which it appears).**\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
