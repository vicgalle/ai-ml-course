When W. V. Quine gave the first of his three Paul Cams Lectures a t
a meeting of the American Philosophical Association i n New York i n
December 1 9 7 1 , h i s Harvard colleague a n d good friend, Nelson Good­
man, was on hand to introduce him . There are two memorable aspects
of Goodman's introduction. First, it is strewn with hilarious plays on
words and insider j okes-exactly Quine's brand of humor. Here is a
sample:
The title of Professor Quine's best-known philosophy book is Word
,md Ob;ect. From the title of these lectures ["The Roots of Reference"l,
[ gather he is going to discuss an important relation of words to
objects-or better, of words to other objects, some of which are not
words-or even better, of objects some of which are words to objects
some of which are not words . . . .
In Professor Quine's many encounters with reference he has always
insisted on such sterling principles as: "Don't refer to what isn't";
"Don't suppose that merely by talking you are saying a nything about
anything"; but on the other hand, "If you do say something a bout
something, don't think you can escape the consequences by saying you
were only talking. "
[ have no idea what the roots of reference are, but [ suppose that
whatever has powers, as reference does, also has roots. But here [ am
probably guilty, in the language of Methods of Logic, of making, in the
full sweep of a feIl swoop, what amounts to a full swap or even a foul
swipe . l

Preface

Second, in a more serious vein, Goodman noted that " i t is high time for
a meta-anthology dr.lwn from the anthologies of his own works already
p ub l ished . " Goodman, we now see, was a visionary as well as a humor­
ist, ahead of his time by some thirty - three years.
All of the selections in this volume have been previously published, al­
though not all of them are taken from Quine's anthologies; some are
dra wn from book chapters and some from j ournals. During the selection
process I worked with three very k nowledgeable outside readers engaged
by Harvard University Press. One of the considerations affecting the
con tents was our desire to produce a book which would be useful to the
Quine specialist and vet accessible to the Quine novice. Toward that end,
we i ncluded both classic essays and expository essays. For example, we
included Quine's classic "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" and his exposi­
tory "Two Dogmas in Retrospect. " Another consideration affecting the
contents was convenience: the availability of these essays in a single vol­
ume will, we hope, prove convenient for the expert and the novice alike.
Finally, i n the same vein we decided not to include any of Quine's techni­
cal writings o n logic.
Readers should note that Chapters 6, 7, and 12 were originally part of
longer essays, and therefore they contain cross-references to sections
that arc not part of the present volume. For the convenience of readers
who may want to consult the original work, we have left all these cross­
references in place. The publication history of each essay is given in the
Credits section at the back of the book.
Quine's writings of the J 930s and the 1 940s were primarily about
technical matters of logic. However, the publication in 1 95 3 of his an­
thology FW1I1 a Logical Point of View: Nine L ogico-Philosophicai Es­
says indicated that he had begun to widen his philosophical horizon:
QU Il1e the logician was also Quine the philosopher. He continued to
publish in both fields throughout his career.
Qui ne's discursive philosophy includes discussions on the following
topics, among others: analyticity, synonymy, indeterminacy of transla­
tion of theoretical sentences, propositions, indeterminacy of reference
( or inscru tability of reference, or ontological relativity) , underdeter­
mination of physical theory, holism, naturalism, empiricism, behavior­
ism, extensionalism, and so on. It is important to sec, however, that
Quine'> philosophy is ,y,tematic. He once remarked that the bulk of his
philosopby consists of corollaries to his commitments to naturalism (see

Preface

" Epistemology Naturalized " ) and extensionalism ( see " Confessions of a
Confirmed Extensionalist " ) .
The secondary literature on Quine i s burgeoning. For example, there
are a number of book-length introductions to Quine's philosophy, in­
cluding my The Philosophy of W. V. Quine: An Expository Essay
( Tampa: University Presses of Florida, 1 9 8 2 ) and Enlightened Empiri­
cism: An Examination of W. V. Quine's Theory of Knowledge (Tampa:

Press, 1 9 8 8 ) ; and Alex Orenstein's W. V. Quine ( Princeton, N.]. : Prince­
ton University Press, 2002 ) .
Important anthologies on Quine's philosophy include Words and Ob­
jections: Essays on the Work of W. V. Quine, ed. D . Davidson and ].

T h e less a science h a s advanced, t h e more its terminology tends t o rest
on a n uncritical assumption of mutual understanding. With increase of
rigo r this hasis is replaced piecemeal hy the introduction of definitions.
The interrelationships recruited for these definitions gain the status of
analytic principles; what was once regarded as a theory ahout the world
becomes reconstrued as a convention of language. Thus it is that some
flow from the theoretical to the conventional is a n adj unct of progress i n
t h e logical foundations of any science. T h e concept of simultaneity at a
distance affords a stock example of such development: in supplanting
the uncritical use of this phrase by a definition, Einstein so chose the
definitive relationship as to verify conventionally the previously para­
doxical principle of the a bsoluteness of the speed of light. But whereas
the physical sciences arc generally recognized as capahle only of incom­
plete evolution in this direction, and as destined to retain always a non­
conventional kernel of doctrine, developments of the past few decades
have led to a widespread conviction that logic and mathematics are
purely analytic or conventional. It is less the purpose of the present in­
quiry to question the validity of this contrast than to question its sense.

A definition, strictly, is a convention of notational a hhreviation. ' A sim­
ple definition introduces some specific expression, e.g., 'kilometer,' or 'e,'
called the definielldum, as arhitrary shorthand for some complex expresJ. See Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathem"t,cs ( Cambridge: Cambridge UnI­
verSIty Press, J 9(3), p. 429.

mit in every case of unambiguous elimination in favor of the antecedent

functionally a definition is not a premise to theory, but a license for re­
writing theory by putting definiens for definiendum or vice versa. By
allowing such replacements a definition transmits truth: it allows true
statements to be translated into new statements which are true by the
same token. Given the truth of the statement 'The altitude of Kibo ex­
ceeds six thousand meters,' the definition of ' kilometer' makes for the
truth of the statement 'The altitude of Kibo exceeds six kilometers';

Whatever may be agreed upon as the exact scope of logic, we may ex­
pect definitional abbreviations of logical truths to be reckoned as logical
rather than extra-logical truths. This being the case, the preceding con­
clusion shows logical consequences of definitions to be themselves truths
of logic. To claim that mathematical truths are conventional in the sense
of following logically fro m definitions is therefore to claim that mathe­
matics is part of logic. The latter claim does not represent an arbitrary
extension of the term ' l ogic' to include mathematics; agreement as to
what belongs to logic and what belongs to mathematics is supposed at
the outset, and it is then claimed that definitions of mathematical expres­
sions can so be framed on the basis of logical ones that all mathematical
truths become a b breviations of l ogical ones.
Although signs introduced by definition are formally arbitrary, more
than such arbitrary notational convention is involved in questions of
definability; otherwise any expression might be said to be definable on
the basis of any expressions whatever. When we speak of definability, or
of finding a definition for a given sign, we have in mind some traditional
usage of the sign antecedent to the definition in question. To be satisfac­
tory in this sense a definition of the sign not only must fulfill the formal
requirement of unambiguous eliminability, but must also conform to the
traditional usage in question. For such conformity it is necessary and
sufficient that every context of the sign which was true and every context
which was false under traditional usage be construed by the definition as
an a bbreviation of some other statement which is correspondingly true
or false under the established meanings of its signs. Thus when defini­
tions of mathematical expressions on the basis of logical ones are said
to have been framed, what is meant is that definitions have been set up
whereby every statement which so involves those mathematical expres­
sions as to be recognized traditionally as true, or as false, is construed
as an abbreviation of another correspondingly true or false statement
which lacks those mathematical expressions and exhibits only logical ex­
pressions in their stead.

Q U I NTESSENCE

An expression will be said to occur vacuously in a given statement i f
i t s replacement therein by any and every other grammatically admissible
expression leaves the truth or falsehood of the statement unchanged.
Thus for any statement containing some expressions vacuously there is a
class of statements, descri bable as vacuous variants of the given state­
ment, which are like it in point of truth or falsehood, like it also in point
o f a certain skeleton of symbolic make-up, but diverse in exhibiting all
grammatically possible variations upon the vacuous constituents of the
given statement. An expression will be said to occur essentially in a state­
ment if it occurs in all the vacuous variants of the statement, i . e . , if it
forms part of the aforementioned skeleton. (Note that though an expres­
sion occur non·vacuously in a statement it may fai l of essential occur­
rence because some of its parts occur vacuously in the statement . )
N o w l e t S b e a truth, let t h e expressions E , occur vacuously in S , and
let the statements S, be the vacuous variants of S. Thus the S, will likewise
be true . On the sole basis of the expressions belonging to a certain class
a, let us frame a definition for one of the expressions F occurring in S
outside the E,. S and the S, thereby become abbreviations of certain state­
ments S' and S', which exhibit only members of a instead of those occur­
rences of F, but which remain so related that the S', are all the results of
replacing the E, in S' by any other grammatically admissible expressions.
Now since our definition of F is supposed to conform to usage, S' and
the S', will, like S and the S" be uniformly true; hence the S', will be vacu­
ous variants o f S', and the occurrences of the E, in S' will be vacuous.
The definition thus makes S a n abbreviation of a truth S ' which, like S,
involves the E, vacuously, but which differs from S in exhibiting only
members of a instead o f the occurrences of F outside the E,. Now it is ob­
vious that an expression cannot occur essentially in a statement if it oc­
curs only within expressions which occur vacuously in the statement; con­
sequently F, occurring in S ' as it does only within the E, if at all, does not
occur essentially in S'; members of a occur essentially in its stead. Thus if
we take F as any nonmember of a occurring essentially in S, and repeat
the above reasoning for each such expression, we see that, through
definitions of all such expressions in terms of members of a, S becomes
an abbreviation of a truth S" involving only members of a essentially.
Thus if in particular we take a as the class of all logical expressions,
sions is accomplished by a single application of one definition, but also when i t is a
complex expression whose elimination calls for successive application of many
defimtions.

Truth by ConventIOn

the above tells us that if logical definitions be framed for all non-logical
expressions occurring essentially in the true statement S, S becomes an
abbreviation o f a truth S" involving only logical expressions essentially.
But if S" involves only logical expressions essentially, and hence re­
mains true when everything except that skeleton of logical expressions is
changed in all grammatically possible ways, then S" depends for its truth
upon those logical constituents alone, and is thus a truth of logic. It is
therefore established that if all non-logical expressions occurring essen­
tially in a true statement S be given definitions on the basis solely of
logic, then S becomes a n a b b reviation of a truth S" of logic. In particular,
then, if all mathematical expressions be defined in terms of logic, all
truths involving only mathematical and logical expressions essentially
become definitional abbreviations of trurhs of logic.
Now a mathematical trurh, for example, 'Smith 's age plus Brown's
equals Brown's age plus Smith's,' may contain non-logical, non-mathe­
matical expressions. Still any such mathematical truth, or another
whereof it is a definitional a bbreviation, will consist of a skeleton of
mathematical or logical expressions filled in with non-logical, non-math­
ematical expressions all of which occur vacuously. Every mathematical
truth either is a truth in which only mathematical and logical expressions
occur essentially, or is a definitional abbreviation of such a truth. Hence,
granted definitions of all mathematical expressions in terms of logic, the
preceding conclusion shows that all mathematical truths become defini­
tional abbreviations of truths of logic-therefore truths of logic in turn.
For the thesis that mathematics is logic it is thus sufficient that all mathe­
matical notation be defined on the basis of logical notation.
If on the other hand some mathematical expressions resist definition
on the basis of logical ones, then every mathematical truth contain­
ing such recalcitrant expressions must contain them only inessentially, or
be a definitional abbreviation of a truth containing such expressions
only inessentially, if all mathematics is to be logic: for though a logical
truth may involve non-logical expressions, it or some other logical truth
whereof it is an abbreviation must involve only logical expressions es­
sentially. It is o f this a lternative that those' avail themselves who regard
mathematical truths, insofar as they depend upon non-logical notions,
as elliptical for hypothetical statements containing as tacit hypotheses all
the postulates of the branch of mathematics in question. Thus, suppose

the geometrical terms 'sphere' and 'includes' to be undefined on the basis
of logical expressions, and suppose all further geometrical expressions
defined on the basis of logical expressions together with 'sphere' and 'in­
cludes,' as with Huntington. Let Huntington's postulates for ( Euclidea n )
geometry, and all t h e theorems, be expanded b y thoroughgoing replace­
ment of definienda by definientia, so that they come to contain only logi­
cal expressions and 'sphere' and 'includes,' and let the conj unction of the
thus expanded postulates be represented as 'Hunt ( sphere, includes) . '
Then, where ' <I> ( sphere, includes ) ' is a n y of the theorems, similarly ex­
panded into primitive terms, the point of view under consideration is
that '<I> ( sphere, includes ) , ' insofar as it is conceived as a mathematical
truth, is to be construed as an ellipsis for "If Hunt (sphere, includes)
then <I> ( sphere, includes ) . ' Since '<I> ( sphere, include s ) ' is a logical conse­
quence of Huntington's postulates, the above hypothetical statement is a
truth of logic; it involves the expressions 'sphere' and 'includes' inessen­
tially, in fact vacuously, since the logical deducibility of the theorems
from the postulates is independent of the meanings of 'sphere' and 'in­
cludes' and survives the replacement of those expressions by any other
grammatically admissible expressions whatever. Since, granted the fit­
ness of Huntington's postulates, all and only those geometrical state­
ments are truths of geometry which are logical consequences in this fash­
ion of 'Hunt ( sphere, includes ) , ' all geometry becomes logic when
interpreted in the above manner as a conventional ellipsis for a body of
hypothetical statements.
But if, as a truth of mathematics, '<I> ( sphere, include s ) ' is short for 'If
Hunt ( sphere, includes) then <I> ( sphere, include s ) , ' still there remains, as
part of this expanded statement, the original statement '<1> (sphere, in­
cludes ) '; this remains as a presumably true statement within some body
of doctrine, say for the moment " n on-mathematical geometry, " even if
the title of mathematical truth be restricted to the entire hypothetical
statement in question. The body of all such hypothetical statements, de­
scribable as the " theory of deduction of non-mathematical geometry, " is
of course a part of logic; but the same is true of any " theory of deduction
of sociology, " " theory of deduction of Greek mythology, " etc., which we
might construct in parallel fashion with the aid of any set of postulates
suited to sociology or to Greek mythology. The point of view toward ge­
ometry which is under consideration thus reduces merely to an exclusion
of geometry from mathematics, a relegation of geometry to the status of
sociology or Greek mythology; the labeling of the " theory of deduction

Truth by

Convention

of non-mathematical geometry" as " mathematical geometry " is a verhal
tour de force which i, equally applicahle Il1 the case of <,oclology or
Greek mythology. To incorporate mathematics into logic by rega rdlllg
all recalcitrant mathematical truths a s elliptical hypothetical statements
is thus in effect merely to restrict the term 'mathematic,' to exclude those
recalcitrant branches. But we a re not i nterested in renaming. Tho,e dIs­
ciplines, geometry and the rest, which have traditionally heen grouped
under mathematics a re the obj ects of the present d Iscussion, and it IS
with the doctrine that mathematic, in this sense is logic that we a re here
concerned. \
Discarding this a lternative and returmng, then, we see tha t If some
mathematical expressions resist definition on the basis o f logIcal one"
mathematics will reduce to logic only if, under a l iteral reading and wI th­
out the gratuitous annexation of hypotheses, every mathematical truth
contains (or is an a h b reviatlOn of one which contains) ;uch recalcItrant
expressions only inessenti a l ly if at all. But a mathematICal expres;,ion
sufficiently trou b l esome to have resisted trivwl contextual defil1 l tion in
terms o f logic can hardly be expected to occur thus idly i n a l l its mathe­
matical contexts . It would thus appear that for the ten ahility of the thesis
that mathematics is logic i t is not only ,ufficient but a lso neces>ary that
all mathematical expressions be capable o f definition on the ba,is ;,oldy
of logica l ones.
Though in framing logical definitions o f mathematical expressIOns the
ultimate obj ective be to make all mathematical truth, logical truth;" at­
tention is not to be confined to mathematical and logical truths III testing
the conformity of the definitions to usage. M a thematical expressIOns he­
long to the general language, and they a re to be so defined that all state­
ments containing them, whether mathematical truths, hi,torical truth"
or fa lsehoods under traditional usage, come to be construed as a b b revia­
tions of other statements which are correspondingly true or false. The
definition introducing 'plu, ' must be such th at the mathematical truth
'Smith 's age plus Brown's equals Brown's age plus Smith";' becomes an
abbreviation of a logica l truth, as observed earlier; but it mu,t al,o be
such that 'Smith's age plus Brown's age e q u a l s Jones' age' becomes an
a bbreviation of a statement which is empi rica lly true or fa lse in confor­
mity with the county records and the traditional usage of 'plu, . ' A defini5. ObVIOusly the foregomg dl�l:usslUn ha,c, n o bearmg upon PO'itulare method <l!:o

tion which fails in this latter respect is no less Pickwickian tha n one
which fails in the former; in either case nothing is achieved beyond the
transient pleasure of a verbal recreation.
But for these considerations, contextual definitions of any mathemati­
cal expressions whatever could be framed immediately in purely logical
terms, on the basis of any set of postulates adequate to the branch of
mathematics in question. Thus, consider again Huntington's systemati­
zation of geometry. It was remarked that, granted the fitness of Hunting­
ton's postulates, a statement will be a truth of geometry if and only if it is
logically deducible from 'Hunt ( sphere, includes ) ' without regard to the
meanings of 'sphere' and 'include s . ' Thus '<I> ( sphere, includes ) ' will be a
truth of geometry if and only if the following is a truth of logic: 'If a is
any class and R any relation such that Hunt (a, R), then <I> (a, R).' For
'sphere' and 'includes' we might then adopt the following contextual
definiti o n : Where '- - -' is any statement containing 'a ' or 'R' or both,
let the statement 'If a is any class and R any relation such that Hunt (a,
R), then - - -' be a bbreviated as that expression which is got from '- - -'
by putting 'sphere' for 'a' and 'includes' fo r ' R ' throughout. (In the case
of a compound statement involving 'sphere' and 'includes,' this defini­
tion does not specify whether it is the entire statement or each of its con­
stituent statements that is to be accounted as shorthand in the described
fashion; but this ambiguity can be eliminated by stipulating that the
convention apply only to whole contexts . ) 'Sphere' and 'includes' thus
receive contextual definition in terms exclusively of logic, for any state­
ment containing one or both of those expressions is construed by the
definition as an abbreviation of a statement containing only logical ex­
pressions ( p lus whatever expressions the original statement may have
contained oth e r than 'sphere' and 'includes ' ) . The definition satisfies past
usage of 'sphere' and 'includes' to the extent of verifying all truths and
falsifying all falsehoods of geometry; all those statements of geometry
which are true, and only those, become a b breviations of truths of logic.
The same procedure could be followed in any other branch of mathe­
matics, with the help of a satisfactory set of postulates for the branch.
Thus nothing further would appear to be wanting for the thesis that
mathematics is logic. And the royal road runs beyond that thesis, for the
described method of logicizing a mathematical discipline can be applied
likewise to any non-mathematical theory. But the whole procedure rests
on failure to conform the definitions to usage; what is logicized is not the
intended subject matter. It is readily seen, e.g., that the suggested contex­
tual definition of 'sphere' and 'includes,' though transforming purely

Truth by

Convention

geometrical truths and fa l sehoods respectively into logic a l truths ,md
falsehoods, tra" , forms certain empirical truths into falsehoods and vice
versa . Consider, e.g., the true statement 'A baseball is roughly a sphere,'
more rigorous Iv "fhe whole of a baseball, except for a certain very thin,
irregula r peripheral laver, constitutes a sphere . ' According to the contex·
tual definition, this statement is an a bbreviation for the following: ' I f (t is
any class and R. any rclation such that Hunt (a, R), then the whole of a
basehall, except for a thin peripheral layer, constitutes an [a memher oft
ct.' This tells us that the whole of a baseball, except for a thin peripheral
layer, belongs to every class a for which a relation R can be found such
that Huntingto n 'S postulates are true o f (1 and R . Now it h appens that
'Hunt (a, IIlciudes ) ' is true not only when a is taken as the class of all
spheres, but abo when (1 is restricted to the class of spheres a foot or
more in diameter;" yet the whole of a baseball, except for a thin periph·

in their Prmcipta Mathematica. They adopt a meager logical language as
primitive, and on its hasis alone they undertake to endow mathematical
expressions with definitions which conform to usage in the full sense de­
scribed ahove: definitions which not only reduce mathematical truths
and falsehoods to logical ones, hut reduce all statements, containing
the mathematical expressions in question, to equivalent statements in­
volving logical expressions instead of the mathematical ones. Within
Prmclpia the program has he en advanced to such a point as to sug­
gest that no fundamental difficulties stand in the way of completing the
process. The foundations o f arithmetic are developed in Principia, and
therewith those hranches of mathematics are accommodated which, like
analysis and theory of number, spring from arithmetic. Abstract a lgehra
proceeds readily from the rela tion theory of Principia. Only geometry
remains untouched, and this field can be brought into line simply by
identifying n-dimensional figures with those n-adic arithmetical relations
("equations in n varia hles") with which they are correlated through ana­
lytic geometry. ' Some question Whitehead and Russell's reduction of
mathematics to 10gic, 1IJ on grounds for whose exposition and criticism
there is not space; the thesis that all mathematics reduces to logic is,
however, substantiated hy Principia to a degree satisfactory to most of
us. There is no need here to adopt a final stand in the matter.
If for the moment we grant that all mathematics is thus definitionally
constructible from logic, then mathematics hecollles true by convention
in a relative sense: mathematical truths hecome conventional transcrip­
tions of logical truths . Perhaps this is all that Ill a ny of us mean to assert
when we assert that mathematics is true by convention; at least, a n ana­
lytic statement is commonly explained merely as one which proceeds
from logic and definitions, or as one which, on replacement of defini­
enda hy definientin, becomes a truth of logicll But in strictness we can9. EduarJ Study, Dw rea/tstlsche Weltanslcht und die Lehre UOIn Raume ( Bruns­

not regard mathematics as true purely by conventioo unless all those log­
ical principles to which m athematics is supposed to reduce are likewise
true by convention. And the doctrine that mathematics is analytic ac­
complishes a less fundamental simplification for philosophy than would
at first appear, if it asserts only that mathematics i s a conventional tran­
scription of logic and not that logic is convention i n turn: for if in the end
we are to countenance any a priori principles at all which a re indepen­
dent of convention, we sholiid not scruple to admit a few more, nor at­
tribute crucial importance to conventions which serve only to diminish
the nllmber of sllch pri nciples by reducing some to others.
But if we are to construe logic also as true by convention, we must rest
logic ultimately upon some manner of convention other than definition :
for it was noted earlier that definitions arc avail a b l e only for transform­
ing truths, not for founding them. The same applies to any truths of
mathematics which, contrary to the supposition of a moment ago, may
resist definitional reduction to logic; i f such truths are to proceed from
convention, without merely being reduced to antecedent truths, they
must proceed from conventions other than definitions. Such a second
sort of convention, generating truths rather than merely transforming
them, has long been recognized in the usc of postulates." Application of
this method to logic will occupy the next section; customary ways o f ren­
dering postulates and rules of i n ference will be departed from, however,
in favor of giving the whole scheme the explicit form of linguistic con­
ventio n .

Let us suppose an approximate maximum of definition to have been ac­
complished for logic, so that we a re left with a bout as meager as possible
an array o f primitive notational devices . There arc indefinitely many
ways o f framing the definitions, all conforming to the same usage of the
expres,ion, in question ; ap,1rt from the obj ective of defi n i ng much in

pose our procedure to be such as to reckon among the primitive devices
the not-idiom, the if- idiom ( ' if . . . then . . . ' ) , the euery-idiom ( 'No mat­
ter what x mav be, - - - x - - -' ) , and one or two more as required. On
the basis o f this much, then, all further logical n otation is to be supposed
defined; all statements involving any further logical notation become
construed as a bbreviations of statements whose logical constituents arc
limited to those primitives.
'Or, ' as a connective joining statements to form new statements, is
amenable to the following contextual definition in terms of the lIot-id­
iom and the iridiom: A pair of statements with 'or' between is an abbre­
viation of the statement made up succesSively of these ingredients: first,
'If'; second, the first statement of the pair, with ' not' inserted to govern
the main verb ( o r, with 'it 1 5 false that' prefixe d ) ; third, 'then'; fourth, the
second statement of the pair. The conventi Oil becomes clearer if we use
the prefix ,� , as an artificial notation of denial, thus writing ' � ice is hot'
instead of 'lce is not hot' or 'It is false that ice is hot.' Where '- - -' and
'-' a re any statements, o u r definition then introduces '- - - or -' as
an abbreviation of 'If --- - - then -.' Aga in 'and,' as a connective
j oining statements, can be defined contextually by construing '- - - and
-' as an abbreviation for '-- if - - - then ---.' Every such idiom is
what is known as a truth fUliction, and is characterized by the fact that
the truth or falsehood of the complex statement which it generates is
uniquely determined by the truth or falsehood of the several statements
which it combines. All truth functions are known to be constructible in
terms of the no/- and If-idioms as in the a bove examples . 11 On the basis
of the truth functions, then, together with our further primitives�the
eu e ry i diom et al.�all further logical devices are supposed defined.
A word may, through historical or other accidents, evoke a train of
ideas bearing no relevance to the truth or falsehood of its context; in
point of meaning, however, as distinct from connotation, a word may be
said to be determined to whatever extent the truth or falsehood of its
contexts is determined. Such determination of truth or falsehood may be
outright, and to that extent the meaning of the word is a bsolutely deter­
mined; or it may be relative to the truth or falsehood of statements con­
taining other words, a n d to that extent the meaning of the word is deter-

mined relativelv to those other words. A definition endows a word with
completely determi nacy of meaning relative to other words. But the al­
ternative is open to us, on introducing a new word, of determining its
meaning absolutely to whatever extent we like by specifying contexts
which are to he true and contexts which are to he false. In bet, we n eed
specify only the former: for falsehood may be regarded as a denv,l ­
tive property depending on the word ' � , ' in such wise that falsehood of
'- - -' means simply truth of ' .. - - -.' Since all contexts o f our new
word are meaningless to begin with, neither true nor false, we are free to
run through the list of such contexts and pick out as true such ones as we
like; those selected hecome true by fiat, by linguistic conventio n . For
those who would question them we have a lwavs the same answer, "You
use the word differently. " The reader may protest that our arbi trary se­
lection of contexts as true is suhject to restrictions imposed by the re­
quirement of consistency-e.g., that we must not select both '- - -' and
'�- - -'; but this consideration, which will receive a clearer status a few
pages hence, will be passed over for the moment.
Now suppose in particular that we a bstract from existing usage of the
locutions 'if-then,' 'not' ( o r ' � ' ) , and the rest of our logical pri m i tives, q,
that for the time being these become meaningless marks, and the erst­
while statements containing them lose their status as statements and be­
come likewise meaningless, neither true nor fa lse; and suppe"e we run
through all those erstwhile statements, or as many of them as we like,
segregating various of them arbitrarily as true. To whatever extent we
carry this process, we to that extent determine meaning for the l I1ili a l l y
meaningless marks 'if,' 'then,' ' � : a n d t h e rest. Such contexts ,IS we ren­
der true are true by convention.
We saw earlier that if all expressions occurring essentially in , 1 true
statement S and not belonging to a class IX a re given definitions i n term,
solely of memhers of a, then S becomes a definitional a b brev'iation of a
truth S" involving only members of a essentially. Now let IX comprise j u,t
our logical primitives, and let S be a statement which, under ordinary us·
age, is true and involves only logical e xpressions essentiallv. Since all log­
ieal expressions other than the primitive, are defined in terms of the
primitives, it then follows that S is an ahbreviation of a truth S" involving
only the primitives essentially. Bur if one statement S is a definiti on..!1 ab­
breviation of another S", the truth of S proceeds wholly from linguistic
convention if the truth of S" does so. Hence if, i n the a bove process of a r·

primitives with meaning, we assign truth to those statements which, ac�
cording to ordinary usage, are trlle and involve only OIlY !nllnltives es�
sentially, then not only will the latter statements be true bv conven�
tion, but so will all statements which are true under ordinary usage and
involve only logical expressions essentially. Since, as remarked earlier,
every logical truth involves ( o r is an a bbreviation of another which in�
volves) only logical expressions essentially, the described scheme of as�
signing truth makes all logic true by convention.
Not only does such assignment of truth suffice to make all those state�
ments true by convention which are true under ordinary usage and in�
volve only logical expressions essentially, but it serves also to make all
those statements false by convention which are false under ordinary us�
age and involve o nly logical expressions essentially. This follows from
our explanation of the falsehood of '- - -' as the truth of ' -'- - -,' since
'- - -' will be false under ordinary usage if and only if ,�- - -' is true nn�
der ordinary usage. The described assignment of truth thus goes far to�
ward fixing all logical expressions in point of meaning, and fixing them in
conformity with usage. Still many statements containing logical expres�
sions remain undecided by the described assignments: all those statements
which , from the standpoint of ordinary usage, involve some non�logical
expressions essentially. 'rhere is hence room for supplementary conven�
tions of one sort or another, over and a bove the described truth assign�
ments, by way of completely fixing the meanings of our pri mitives-and
fixing th em, it is to be hoped, in conformity with ordinary usage. Such
supplementation need not concern us now; the described truth assign�
ments provide partial determinations which, as far as they go, conform
to usage, and which go far enough to make all logic true by convention.
But we m u st not be deceived by schematism . It would appear that
we sit down to a list of expressions and check off as arbitrarily true all
those which, under ordinary usage, arc true statements involving only
our logical primitives essentially; but this picture wanes when we reflect
that the num ber of such statements is infinite . If the convention whereby
those statements are singled out as true is to be formulated in fi nite
terms, we must a vail ourselves of conditions finite in length which deter�
mine infinite classes of expressions.!4

of expressions all of which, under ordinary usage, are true statements in­
volving onlv our primitive if idiom essentially, is the condition of being
obtainable from :
-

(1\

If if P then q then if if q then r then if p then r

by putting a statement for 'p,' a statement for 'q,' and a statement for 'r. '
In more customary language the form ( 1 ) would b e expanded, for clarity,
in some such fa shion as this: 'If it is the case that if p then q, then, if it is
the case further that i f q the n r, then, if p , r. ' The form ( 1 ) is thus seen to
be the principle of the syllogism. O bviously it is true under ordinary us­
age for all substitutions of statements for 'f),' q and 'r'; hence such re­
sults of su bstitution are, under ordinary usage, true statements involving
only the if idiom essentially. One infinite part of our program of assign­
ing truth to all expressions which, under ordinary usage, are true state­
ments i nvolving only our logical primitives essentially, is thus accom­
plished hy the following convention:
'

,'

-

(I) Let all results o/puttillg a statement for 'p,' a statement for 'q,' and
a statement Ie" 'r ' in ( I ) be true.

Another infinite part of the program is disposed of by adding this con­
vention:
(II) tet any expression be true which yields a truth when put for 'q ' in
the result of fJUtting a truth for 'p' in 'If p then q.'

Given truths '- - -' and 'If - - - then -, ' (IT) yields the truth of '-. '
That (II) conforms t o usage, i . e . , that from statements which are true un­
der ordinary usage (II) leads only to statements which are likewise true
under ordinary usage, is seen from the fact that under ordinary usage a
statement '-' is always true if statements '- - -' and 'If - - - then -'
arc true. Given all the truths yielded hy ( I ) , (II) yields another infinity of
truths which, like the former, are under ordinary usage truths involving
only the if-idiom essentially. How this comes a hout is seen rough Iy as
fo llows. The truths yielded by (I), being of the form of (I), are complex
statements of the form 'If - - - then -.' The statement '- - -' here may
in particular be of the form ( 1 ) in turn, and hence likewise be true ac­
cording to ( I ) . Then, by (II), - ' becomes true. In general '-' will not
be of the form (1), hence would not have been obtainable by (I) alone.
Still '-' will in every such case be a statement which, under ordinary
usage, is tnte and involves only the if-idiom essentially; this follows
from the observed conformity of (I) and (II) to usage, together with the
'

17

fact that the above derivation if '-' demands nothing of '-' heyond
proper structure i n terms of 'if-then . '
N o w o ur stock of truths e mbraces n o t only those yielded by ( I ) alone,
i . e . , th",e h a ving the form ( 1 ) , but also all those thence deriva ble by ( I I )
i n t h e m a n n e r i n which ' - ' h a s j ust n o w been supposed derived. 1 1 From
this increased stock we can derive yet further ones by (II), and these like­
wise will, under ordinary usage, be true and involve only the iridiom es­
sentially. The generation proceeds in this fashion ad infinitum,
When p rovided onlv with ( I ) as an auxiliary source of truth, (II) thus
yields only truths which under ordinary usage are truths involving only
the Iridiom essenti'llly. When provided with further auxiliary sources of
truths, however, e . g . , the convention ( I I I ) which is to follow, (II) yields
truths i nvolving further loclltions essentially. Indeed, the effect of (II) is
not even confined to statements which, under ordinary usage, involve
only logical locutions essentially; (II) also legislates regarding other
statements, to the extent o f specifying that no two statements '- - -' and
'If - - - then -' can hoth be true unless '-' is true. But this overflow
need not disturb us, since it also conforms to ordinary usage. I n fact,
it was remarked earlier that room remained for supplementary con­
ventions, over and above the described truth assignments, by way of
further determining the meanings of our primitives. This overflow ac­
complishes just th at for the iridiom; it provides, with regard even to a
statement ' I f - - - then -' which from the standpoint of ordinary us­
age involves non-logical expressions essentially, that the statement is not
to be true i f '- - -' is true and '-' not.
But present concern is with statements which, under ordinary usage,
involve only our logical primitives essentially; by (I) and ( II ) we have
provided for the truth of an infinite number of such statements, but by
no means a l l . The fol lowing convention provides for the truth of another
infinite set of such statements; these, in contrast to the preceding, involve
not only the If-Idiom hut also the not-idiom essentially ( under ordinary
usage ) .

Statements generated thus by su bstitution in 'If p then if � P then q ' are
statements of hypothetica l form in which two mutually contradictory
statements occur as premises; obviously such statements are trivially
true, under ordi nary usage, n o matter what mav figure as conclusion.
Statements generated by substitution in 'If lit is the case that l if '� p then
p , then p ' arc li kewise true lInder ordinary usage, for one reason as fol­
lows: Grant the hypothesis, viz., that if /' then p; then we must admit
the conclusion, viz . , that p , since even denying it we admit it. Thus all the
results o f substitution referred to in ( I l l ) arc true under ordinary usage
no matter what the substituted statements may be; hence such results of
substitution are, under ordinary usage, true statements involving noth­
ing essentially beyond the iridiom and the !lot-idiom (
).
From the infinity of truths adopted in ( I l l ) , together with those already
at hand from (I) and ( I l ) , infinitely more truths are generated by (IT). It
happens, curiously enough, that ( 1IJ) adds even to our stock o f state­
ments which involve only the if-idiom essentially ( under ordinary usage ) ;
there a r e truths of that description which, though lacking the not-idiom,
are reached bv ( I )-(ITJ) and not hy (1\ and ( I I ) . This is true, e.g., of any
instance o f the principle of identitv, say:
�

'� '

(2)

If time is money then time is money.

It will be instructive to derive ( 2 ) from ( 1 )- ( 1 l I ) , as an illustration o f the
general manner in which truths are generated by those conventions. ( II I ) ,
to begin with, directs that we adopt these statements as true:
(3)

If time i s monev then if time is not money then time is money.

(4)

If if time is n o t money then time is money then time is lll oney.

( I ) directs that we adopt this as true:
(5)

I f if time is money then if time is not money then time is money
then if if if time is not money then time is money then time is
money then if time is money then time is money.

( U ) tells us that, in view of the truth of ( 5 ) and ( 3 ) , this is true:

(6)

I f if if time i s not money then time i s money then time is money
then i f time is money then time is money.

Finally ( 1 I ) tells us that, in view of the truth of ( 6 ) a n d ( 4 ) , ( 2 ) is true.
I f a statement S is generated by ( 1 )-(lIT ) , obviously only the structure
of S in terms of 'if-then' and
was relevant to the generation; hence all
those variants S, of S which are obtainable by any grammatically admis, � '

sible substi tutions upon constituents of S not containing ' i f, ' 'then,' or
' � ,' are likewise generated by ( 1 )-(111 ) . N o w i t h a s been observed that
( I )- ( l I l ) conform to usage, i . e . , generate onlv statements which a re true
under ordinary usage; hence S and all the S, are uniformly true under or­
dinary usage, the S. arc therefore vacuous variant s of S, and hence only
'if,' 'then,' and ' -- ' occur essentially in S. Thus ( I )-(lIl) generate only
statements which under ordlllary usage are truths involving only the if­
idiom and the /lot-idiom e"ential ly,
It can be shown also that ( I )- ( l J I ) generate all such statements. " Con­
sequently ( l )-( I I I ) , aided by our definitions o f logical locutions in terms
of our primitives, a re adequ ate to the generation of all statements which
under ordinary usage a re truths which involve any of the so-called truth
functions but nothing else essentially: for it has been remarked that all
the truth functions a rc definable on the basis of the if-idiom and the /lot­
idiom. All such truths thus become true by convention. They comprise
all those statements which arc instances of any o f the principles of the
so-called propositional calculus.
To ( I ) - ( J I I ) we may now add a further convention o r t w o to cover a n ­
other of our logical primitives-say t h e eucry-idiom. A little m o r e in this
direction, by way of providing for our remaining primitives, and the pro­
gram is completed; all statements which under ordinary usage arc truths
involving only our logical primitives essentially become true by conven­
tion. Therewith, as observed earlier, all logic becomes true by conven­
tion. The conventions with which ( I )- ( I l I ) arc thus to be supplemented
will be more complex tha n ( I )-(lII), and considerable space would be
needed to present them. But there is no need to do so, for ( I )-( lII ) pro­

would be an adaptation of one of various existing systematizations of
general logistic, in the same way in which (I )-(III) are an adaptation of a
systematization of the propositional calculus.
The systematization chosen must indeed leave some l ogica l statements
undecided, by Godel's theorem, if we set generous bounds to the logical
vocabulary. But logic still becomes true by convention insofar as it gets
reckoned as true on any account.
Let us now consider the protest which the reader raised e a r l ier, viz.
that our freedom in assigning truth by convention is s u bj ect to restric­
tions imposed by the requirement of consistency. " Under the fiction, im­
plicit in an earlier stage of our discussion, that we check off our tru ths
one by one in an exhaustive list of expressions, consistency in the assign­
ment of truth is nothing more than a special case of conformity to mage.
If we make a mark in the margin opposite a n expression '- - -,' and an­
other opposite , �- - -,' we sin only against the established usage of
as a denial sign. Under the latter usage ' - - - ' a n d ' � - - - ' are not both
true; in taking them both by convention as true we merely endow the
sign ' � , ' roughly speaking, with a meaning other than denial. Indeed, we
might so conduct our assignments of truth as to a llow no sign o f our lan­
guage to behave analogously to the denial locution of ordinary usage;
perhaps the resulting language would be inconvenient, but conventions
are often inconvenient. It is only the obj ective of ending up with our
mother tongue that dissuades us from marking both '- - -' and
- - ,'
and this obj ective would dissuade us also from marking 'It is a lway, cold
on Thursday. '
T h e requirement of consistency still retains the above status when
we assign truth wholesale through general conventions such as ( I )-( I ll ) .
Each such convention assigns truth t o an infinite sheaf of t h e entries in
our fictive list, and in this function the conventions cannot conflict; by
overlapping in their effects they reinforce one another, by not overlap­
ping they remain indifferent to one another. If some of the conventions
specified entries to which truth was not to be assigned, gen uine con­
flict might be apprehended; such negative conventions, however, have
not been suggested. (II) was, indeed, described earlier as specifying that
'If - - - then -' is not to be true if '- - -' is true and '-' not; but
within the framework of the conventions of truth assignment this appar­
ent proscription is ineffectual without antecedent proscription of '-. '

Thus any inconsistency among the general conventions will be of the
sort previously considered, viz. the arbitrary adoption of both '- - -' and
,�- - -' as true; a n d the adoption of these was seen merely to impose
some meaning other than denial upon the sign
As theoretical restric­

Circumscription of our logical primitives in pomt of meaning, through
conventional assignment of truth to varIOUS of their contexts, has been
seen to render all logic true by conventi o n . Then i f we grant the thesis
that mathematics is logic, I . e . , that all mathematical truth� are defini­
tional abbreviations of logical truths, it follows that mathematics is true
by convention.
If on the other hand, contrary to the thesi� that mathematics is l ogic,
some mathematical expressions resist definition in terms of logical ones,
we can extend the foregomg method into the domain of these recalci­
trant expressions: we can c i rcumscri be the latter through conventional
assignment of truth to varIOUS of their contexts, and thus render mathe­
matics conventionally true in the same fashion i n which logic has been
rendered so. Thus, suppose some mathematical expressions to resist log­
ical definition, and suppose them to be reduced to a� meager as possi­
ble a set of mathematical primitives . In terms of these and our logical
primitives, then, all further mathematical devices are supposed defined;
all statements containing the latter become abbreviations of statements
containing by way of mathematical notation only the primitives. Here,
as remarked earlier in the case of logic, there are alternative courses of
definition and therewith alternative sets of primitives; but suppose o ur
procedure to be such as to count 'sphere' and 'includes' among the math­
ematical primitives. So far we have a set of conventions, ( I )-(III) and a
few more, let us call them (IV)-(VII) , which together circumscri be our
logical primitives and yield all logic. By way of circumscribing the fur­
ther primitives 'sphere' and ' includes,' let u� now add this convention to
the set:
(VIII) Let 'Hunt (sphere, includes) ' be true.
Now we saw earlier that where '<1> ( sphere, includes ) ' i� any theorem of
geometry, supposed expanded into primitive terms, the statement:

Tru th by Conve n t I o n

(7)

I f H u n t ( sphere, includes) then <1> ( sphere, includes)

is a truth of logic. Hence (7) is one of the expressions to which truth is
assigned by the conventions ( I )-(VII ) . Now ( II ) instructs us, in view of
convent i o n (Vl I I ) and the truth of (7), to adopt '<1> ( sphere, includes ) ' as
true. In this way each theorem of geometry is seen to be present among
the statements to which truth is assigned by the conventions ( I )-(VII ) .
We have considered four ways of constru ing geometry. One way con­
sisted of straightforward definition of geometrica l expressions in terms
of logical ones, within the direction of development represented by Prln­
Clpta Mathematica; this way, presumably, would depend upon identifica­
tion of geometry with algebra through the correlations of analytic geom­
etry, and definition of algebraic expressions on the basis of logical ones
as in PrincipIa Mathematica. By way of conce>sion to those who have
fault to find with certain technical point> i n PrinCIpIa, this possibility
was allowed to retain a tentative status. The other three ways all made
use of Huntington's postulates, but are sharply to be distinguished from
one another. The first was to include geometry in logic by construing
geometrical truths as elliptical for hypothetical statements bearing 'Hunt
(sphere, includes ) ' as hypothesis; this was seen to be a mere evasion, tan­
tamount, under its verbal disguise, to the concession that geometry is not
logic after all. The next procedure was to define 'sphere' and 'includes'
contextually in terms of logical expressions by construing '<1> ( sphere, in­
clude s ) ' in every case as an abbreviation of ' I f a is any class and R any re­
lation such that Hunt (a, R ) , then <1> (a, R ) . ' This definition was con­
demned on the grounds that it fails to yield the intended usage of the
defined terms. The last procedure finally, j ust now presented, renders ge­
ometry true by convention without making it part of logic. Here 'Hunt
( sphere, includes ) ' is made true by fiat, by way of conventionally delimit­
ing the meanings of 'sphere' and 'includes . ' The theorems of geometry
then emerge not as truths of logic, but in parallel fashion to the truths of
logic.
This last method of accommodating geometry is available also for any
other branch o f mathematics which may resist definitional reduction to
logic. In each case we merely set up a conj unction of postulates for that
branch as true by fiat, as a conventional circumscrIption of the meanings
of the constituent primitives, and all the theorems of the branch thereby
become true by convention: the convention thus newly adopted together
with the conventions ( I )-(VI I ) . In this way mathematics becomes con­
ventionally true, not by becoming a definitional transcription of logic,

23

24

QUINTESSENCE

but by proceeding from l mguistic convention in the same way as does
logic.
But the method can even be carried beyond mathematics, into the so­
called empirical sciences . Having framed a maximum of definitions in
the latter realm, we can circumscribe as many of Out " empirica l " primi­
tives as we like by adding further conventions to the set adopted for logic
and mathematics; a corresponding portion of " empirica l " science then
becomes conventionally true in precisely the manner observed above for
geometry.
The impossibility of defining any of the " empirical" expressions in
terms exclusively of logical and mathematical ones may be recognized at
the outset: for if any proved to be so definable, there can be no question
but that it would thenceforward be recognized as belonging to pure
mathematics. O n the other hand, vast numbers of " empirical " expres­
sions are of course definable on the basis of logical and mathematical
ones together with other " empirica l " ones. Thus 'momentum' is defined
as 'mass times velocity'; 'event' may be defined as 'referent of the later­
relation,' i . e . , 'whatever is later than something'; 'instant' may be defined
as 'maximal class o f events no one of which is later than any other event
of the class'; 1 9 'time' may be defined as 'the class of all instants'; and so
on. In these examples 'momentum' is defined on the basis of mathemati­
cal expressions together with the further expressions 'mass' and 'veloc­
ity'; 'event,' 'instant,' and 'time' are all defined on the basis ultimately of
logical expressions together with the one further expression 'later than. '
N o w suppose definition t o have been performed t o the utmost among
such non-logical, non-mathematical expressions, so that the latter are re­
duced to as few " empirical " primitives as possible.20 A ll statements then
become abbreviations of statements containing nothing beyond the logi­
cal and mathematical primitives and these " empirical " ones. Here, as be­
fore, there are alternatives of definition and therewith alternative sets of
primitives; hut s uppose our primitives to be such as to include ' later
than,' and consider the totality of the known truths which under ordi1 9 . Bertrand Russell, Our Knowledge of the External World ( C h icago and Lon·

nary usage are truths involving only 'later than' and mathematical or
logical expressions essenti al ly. Example" of such ,tatement; a re ' N oth­
ing is later than itself'; 'If Pompey died later than Brutus and Brutus died
later than Caesar then Pompey died later than Caesar. ' All such ,tate­
ments will be either very general principles, like the fir,t example, or else
i nstances of such principles, like the second example. Now it i" a 5imple
matter to frame a small set of general statements from which all and o n ly
the statements under consideration can be derived by means of logic and
mathematics. The conj unction of these few general statements can then
be adopted as true by fiat, as ' Hunt ( sphere, includes ) ' was adopted i n
(VIII ) ; their adoption i s a conventional circumscription of the meaning
of the primitive 'later th a n . ' Adoption of this convention renders a l l the
known truths conventionally true which under ordinary usage are truths
essentially involving any logical or mathematical expre" ion;, o r 'later
tha n ,' or any of the expressions which, like 'event; 'instant,' and 'time, '
are defined on the basis of the foregoing, a n d inessentially involving any­
thing else.
Now we can pick another of o u r "emplflca l " pnmltives, perhap,
'body' or 'mass' or 'energy,' and repeat the process . We can continue in
this fashion to any desired point, circumscribing one primitive a fter an­
other by convention, and rendering conventi o n a ll y true all known truth,
which under ordinary usage are truths essentially II1volvmg only the lo­
cutions treated up to that point. I f i n disposll1g <,uccessively of our " em­
pirical " primitives in the above fashion we take them up i n an order
roughly describable as leading from the general to the ;pecial, then a, we
progress we may expect to have to deal more and more with ;tatements
which are true under ordinary usage only with reservations, only with a
proba bility recognized as short of certa inty. But such reservation; need
not deter us from rendering a statement true by convention; so long as
under ordinary usage the presumption is rather for than agam5t the
statement, our convention conforms to u,age i n verifYll1g it. I n thus ele­
vating the statement from putative to conventional truth, we sti l l retam
the right to falsify the statement tomorro w if tho,e events ,hould be ob­
served which would have occasioned its rep udiation while it wa5 sti ll pu ­
tative: for conventions a r e commonly revi,ed w h e n n e w observations
show the revision to be convenient.

meant is that the primitives c a n be conventionally clrcumscnbed 111 ,uch
fashion a; to generate a ll and only the accepted truth, of logiC a n d math­
ematics, the characterization is empty; our last conslderatJom show that

26

QUINTESSENCE

the same might be said of any other body of doctrine as well. If o n the
other hand it is meant merely that the speaker adopts such conventions
for those fields but not for others, the characterization is uninteresting;
while if it is meant that it is a general practice to adopt such conventions
explicitly for those fields but not for others, the first part of the charac­
terization is false.
Still, there is the apparent contrast between logico-mathematical
truths and others that the former are a priori, the latter a posteriori; the
former have " the character of an inward necessity, " in Kant's phrase, the
latter do not. Viewed behavioristically and without reference to a meta­
physical system, this contrast retains reality as a contrast between more
and less firmly accepted statements; and it obtains antecedently to any
post facto fashioning of conventions. There are statements which we
choose to surrender last, if at all, in the course of revamping our sciences
in the face of new discoveries; and among these there are some which we
will not surrender at all, so basic are they to our whole conceptual
scheme. Among the latter are to be counted the so-called truths of logic
and mathematics, regardless of what further we may have to say of their
status in the course of a subsequent sophisticated philosophy. Now since
these statements are destined to be maintained independently of our ob­
servations of the world, we may as well make use here of our technique
of conventional truth assignment and thereby foresta ll awkward meta­
physical questions as to our a priori insight into necessary truths. On the
other hand this purpose would not motivate extension of the truth-as­
signment process into the realm of erstwhile contingent statements . O n
s u c h grounds, then, logic and mathematics may be h e l d t o be conven­
tional while other fields are not; it may be held that it is philosophically
important to circumscri be the logical and mathematical primitives by
conventions of truth assignment but that it is idle elaboration to carry
the process further. Such a characterization of logic and mathematics is
perhaps neither empty nor uninteresting nor false.
In the adoption of the very conventions ( I )-(III), etc . , whereby logic it­
self is set up, however, a difficulty remains to be faced. Each of these con­
ventions is general, announcing the truth of every one of a n infinity of
statements conforming to a certain description; derivation of the truth of
any sufficient statement from the general convention thus requ ires a logi­
cal inference, and this involves us in an infinite regress. E.g., in deriving
( 6 ) from ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) on the a u thority of (II) we infer, from the general an­
nouncement (II) and the specific premise that ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) are true state­
ments, the conclusion that

Truth by Convention

(7)

27

( 6 ) is t o b e true.

An examination of this inference will reveal the regress. For present pur­
poses it will be simpler to rewrite (II) thus:
( II ' ) No matter what x may be, no matter what y may be, no matter
what z may be, if x and z are true [statements] and z is the result of put­
ting x for 'p ' and y for 'q ' in 'If p then q ' then y is to be true.
We are to take ( II ' ) as a premise, then, and in addition the premise that
( 3 ) and ( 5 ) are true. We may also grant it as known that ( 5 ) is the result
of putting ( 3 ) for 'p' and ( 6 ) for ' q ' in 'If p then q. ' Our second premise
may thus be rendered compositely as follows:
(8)

( 3 ) and ( 5 ) are true and ( 5 ) i s the result o f putting ( 3 ) for 'p' and
(6) for 'q' in 'If p then q. '

From these two premises we propose to infer ( 7 ) . This inference is obvi­
ously sound logic; as logic, however, it involves use of ( II ' ) and others of
the conventions from which logic is supposed to spring. Let us try to per­
form the inference on the basis of those conventions. Suppose that our
convention ( IV ) , passed over earlier, is such as to enable us to infer spe­
cific instances from statements which, like ( II ' ) , involve the e very idiom;
i.e., suppose that (IV) entitles us in general to drop the prefix 'No matter
what x [or y, etc . ] may be' and simultaneously to introduce a concrete
designation instead of 'x ' [or 'y, ' etc . ] in the sequel. By invoking (IV)
three times, then, we can infer the following from ( II ' ) :
-

(9)

If ( 3 ) a n d ( 5 ) are true and ( 5 ) is the result of putting ( 3 ) for 'p'
and ( 6 ) for ' q ' in 'If p then q' then ( 6 ) is to be true.

It remains to infer (7) from ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) . But this is an inference of the
kind for which ( II ' ) is needed; from the fact that
( 1 0)

( 8 ) and ( 9 ) are true and ( 9 ) is the result of putting ( 8 ) for 'p' and
(7) for 'q' in 'If p then q'

we are to infer ( 7 ) with help of ( II ' ) . But the task of getting ( 7 ) from (10)
and ( II ' ) is exactly analogous to our original task of getting ( 6 ) from ( 8 )
and ( II ' ) ; the regress i s thus under way." ( Incidentally the derivation of
(9) from ( II ' ) by (IV), granted j ust now for the sake of argument, would

encounter a similar obstacle; so also the various unanalyzed steps in the
derivation of ( 8 ) . \
In a word, the difficulty is that if logic is to proceed mediately from
conventions, logic is needed for inferring logic from the conventions. Al­
ternatively, the difficulty which appears thus as a self-presupposition of
doctrine can be framed as turning upon a sclf-presupposition of primi­
tives. It is supposed that the if�idiom, the not-idiom, the every-idiom,
and so on, mean nothing to us initially, and that we adopt the conven­
tions ( I )-(VII) by way of circumscribing their meaning; and the difficulty
is that communication of ( J )-(VlT) themselves depends upon free use of
those very idioms which we are attempting to circumscribe, and can suc­
ceed only if we are already conversant with the idioms. This becomes
clear as soon as ( l )- ( Vl T ) a r e rephrased in rudimentary language, a fter
th e manner of ( II ' ) ." It is impo rtant to note that this difficulty besets
only the method of wholesale truth assignment, not that of definition. It
is true, e.g., that the contextual definition of 'or' presented at the begin­
ning of the second section was communicated with the help of logical
and other expressions which cannot be expected to have been endowed
with meaning at the stage where logical expressions are first being intro­
duced. But a definition has the peculiarity of being theoretically dispens­
able; it introduces a scheme of ahbreviation, and we arc free, if we like,
to forego the brevity which it affords until enough primitives have been
endowed with meaning, through the method of truth assignment or oth­
erwise, to accommodate fu ll exposition of the definition. On the other
hand the conventions of truth assignment cannot be thus withheld until
preparations are complete, because they are needed in the preparations.
If the truth assignments were made one by one, rather than an infinite
number at a time, the above difficulty would disappear; truths of logic
such as (2) would simply be asserted severally by fiat, and the problem of

inferring them from more general conventions would not arise. This
course was seen to be closed to us, however, by the infinitude of the
truths of logic.
It may still be held that the conventions ( 1 )-(VIIl) , etc . , are ohserved
from the start, and that logic and mathematics thereby become conven­
tional. It may be held that we can adopt conventions through behavior,
without first announcing them in words; and that we can return and for­
mulate our conventions verbally afterward, if we choose, when a full
language is at our disposal . It may be held that the verbal formulation
of conventions is no more a prerequisite of the adoption of the conven­
tions than the writing of a grammar is a prerequisite of speech; that ex­
plicit exposition of conventions is merely one of manv important uses of
a completed language. So conceived, the conventions no longer involve
us in vicious regress. Inference from general conventions is no longer
demanded initially, but remains to the su bsequent sophisticated stage
where we frame general statements of the conventions and show how
various specific conventional truths, used all along, fit into the general
conventions as thus formulated.
It must be conceded that this account accords well with what we ac­
tually do. We discourse without first phrasing the conventions; after­
wards, in writings such as this, we formulate them to fit our behavior.
On the other hand it is not clear wherein an adoption of the conven­
tions, antecedently to their formulation, consists; such behavior is dif­
ficult to distinguish from that in which conventioos are disregarded.
When we first agree to understand 'Cambridge' as referring to Cam­
bridge in England, failing a suffix to the contrary, and then discourse ac­
cordingly, the role of linguistic convention is intelligihle; hut when a con­
vention is incapable of heing communicated until after its adoption, its
role is not so clear. In dropping the attributes of deli berateness and ex­
plicitness from the notion of linguistic convention we risk depriving the
latter of any explanatory force and reducing it to an idle label. We mav
wonder what one adds to the bare statement that the truths of logic and
mathematics are a priori, or to the still barer behavioristic statement that
they arc firmly accepted, when he characterizes them as true by conven­
tion in such a sense.
The more restricted thesis discussed in the first section, viz., that math­
ematics is a conventiona l transcription of logic, is far from trivial; its
demonstration is a highly technical undertaking and an important one,
irrespectively o f what its relevance may be to fundamental principles of

29

30

philosophy. It is valuable to show the reducibility of any principle to an­
other through definition of erstwhile primitives, for every such achieve­
ment reduces the number of our presuppositions and simplifies and in­
tegrates the structure of our theories. But as to the larger thesis that
mathematics and logic proceed wholly from l inguistic conventions, only
further clarification can assure us that this asserts anything at all.

TWO D O G M A S O F E M P I R l C I S M

Modern empiricism has been conditioned i n large part b y two dogmas.
One is a belief in some fundamental cleavage between truths which are
analytic, or grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact, and
truths which are synthetic, or grounded in fact. The other dogma is
reductionism: the belief that each mean ingful statement is equivalent to
some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience.
Both dogmas, I shall argue, are ill-founded. One e ffect of a bandoning
them is, as we shall see, a blurring of the supposed boundary between
specul ative metaphysics and natural science. Another effect is a shift to­
ward pragmatism.
1 . Background for Ana lyticity

Kant's cleavage between analytic and synthetic truths was foreshadowed
in Hume's distinction between relations of ideas and matters of fact,
and in Leibniz's distinction between truths of reason and truths of fact.
Leibniz spoke of the truth s of reason as true in all possible worlds. Pic­
turesqueness aside, this is to say that the truths of reason are those which
could not possibly be fa lse. In the same vein we hear analytic statements
defined as statements whose denials are self-contradictory. But this defi­
nition has small explanatory value; for the notion of self-contrad ictori­
ness, in the quite broad sense needed for this definition of analvticity,
stands in exactly the same need of clarification as does the notion of
analyticity itself. The two notions are the two sides of a single dubious
coin.
Kant conceived of an analytic statement as one that attributes to its
suhject no more than is already conceptually contained in the subject.
31

l2

Q U I � T E S ' E ;\J C F

This formulation h a s two shortcomings: it l imits itself to statements of
sunj ect-predicate form, .lnd it appeals to a notion of containment which
is left at a metaphorical level. But Kant's intent, evident more from the
use he makes o f the notIon of analyticity than from his definition of it,
can be restated thus: a statement is ana lytic when it is true by virtue of
meanings and independently of fact. Pursuing this line, let us examine
the concept of meamng which is presupposed.
Meaning, let us remember, i s not to he identified with naming l I'rege's
example of ' F.vening Star' and 'Morning Sta r,' and Russell's of 'Scott'
and 'the author of Waverley,' illustrate that terms can name the same
thing bur differ in meaning. The distinction netween meaning and nam­
ing i s no less important at the level o f a bstract terms. The terms '9' and
'the number of the plam·ts' name one and the same abstract entitv but
presumably must be regarded as unlike in meaning; for astronomical ob­
servation was needed, and not mere reflection on meanings, to determine
the sameness of the entity in question.
The a bove examples consist o f singular terms, concrete and a bstract.
With genera l terms, o r predicates, the situation is somewhat different
but parallel. Whereas a singular term purports to name an entity, a b­
stract or concrete, ;) general tefIll does not; but a general term is true of
an entity, or of each of many, or of none.' The class of all entities of
which a general term is true is called the extension of the term. Now par­
alleling the contrast between the meaning of a singular term and the en­
tity named, we nm't distingui s h equally between the meaning of a gen­
eral term and its extension. 'rhe general terms 'creature with a heart' and
'creature with k i dneys,' tor example, .He perhaps alike i n extension bur
unlike i n me,lfling.
Confusion o f meaning with extension, in the case of general terms, is
less common th'lI1 confUSIon of meaning with naming in the case of sin­
gula r terms. It is indeed a commonplace in philosophy to oppose inten­
sion (or nll� a ning) to extension, Of, in a variant vocabulary, connotation
to denotation.
'rhe Ari,totclian notIon o f c"ence was the forerunner, no doubt, of
the modern notion of i ntemion or meaning. For Aristotle it was essential
in men to he rational, accidental to be two-legged. But there is an imporI . �ee belovo,: [Clu ptef 9 uf the prescot volume ] .

tant difference between this attitude and the doctrine of meaning. From
the latter point of view it may i ndeed be conceded ( i f only for the sake of
argument) that rationality is involved in the meaning of the word 'man'
while two-leggedness is not; but two-legged ness may at the same time be
viewed as involved in the meaning of 'biped' while rational ity is not.
Thus from the point of view of the doctrine of meaning it makes no sense
to say of the actual individual, who is at once a man and a biped, tbat his
rationality is essential and his two-legged ness accidental or vice versa .
Things h a d essences, for Aristotle, hut only linguistic forms have mean­
ings. Meaning is what essence becomes when i t is d ivorced from the ob­
j ect of reference and wedded to the word.
For the theory of meaning a conspicu ous question is the nature o f its
obj ects: what sort of things are meanings ? A felt need for meant entities
may derive from an earlier failure to appreciate that meaning and refer­
ence are distincr. O nce the theory of meaning is sharply separated from
the theory of reference, it is a short step to recognizing as the primary
business of the theory of meaning simply the synonymy of linguistic
forms and the analyticity of statements; meanings themse lves, as obscure
intermediary entities, may well be abandoned. 1
The problem of analyticity then confronts us anew. Statements which
are analytic by general philosophical acclaim arc not, indeed, far to seek .
They fall into two classes. Those of the first class, which may be called
logically true, are typified by:
(1)

No unmarried man is married.

The relevant feature of this example is that i t not merely is true as it
stands, but remains true under any and all reinterpretations of 'man' and
'marrie d . ' If we suppose a prior inventory of logical particles, compris­
ing "no,' 'un-,' 'not,' 'if,' 'then,' "and,' etc . , then in genera l a logical truth
is a statement which is true and remains true under all reinterpretations
of its components other than the logical particles.
But there is also a second class of analytic statements, typified by:
(2)

N o bachelor is married.

The characteristic of such a statement is that it can be turned into a logi­

proper characterization of this second class of analytic statements, and
therewith of analyticity geoerally, inasmuch as we have had in the aboye
description to lean o n a notion of " synonymy " which is no less in need
of clarification than analyticity itself.
In recent years Carnap has tended to explain analyticity by appeal to
what he calls state�descriptions.4 A state�description is any exh austive
assignment of truth val lies to the atomic, or nOl1compollnd, statements
of the language. All other statements of the language are, Carnap as�
Slimes, built lip of their component clauses by means of the familiar logi�
cal devices, in such a way that the truth value of any complex statement
is fixed for each state�description by specifia ble logical laws. A statement
is then explained as analytic when it comes out true under every state de�
scription. 'rhis account is an adaptation of Leibniz's " true in all possible
worlds . " But note that this version of ana lyticity serves its purpose only
if the atomic statements of the language are, unlike 'John is a bachelor'
and 'John is married; mutually independent. Otherwise there would be
a state�description which assigned truth to 'John is a bachelor' and to
'John is married,' and consequently ' N o bachelors a r e married' would
turn out synthetic rather than analytic under the proposed criterion.
Thus the criterion of analyticity in terms of state�descriptions serves only
for langu ages devoid of extra�logical synonym�pairs, such as 'bachelor'
and 'unmarried man'-synonym�pairs of the type which give rise to the
" second class" of analytic statements. 'rhe criterion in terms of state�de�
scriptions is a reconstruction at best of logical truth, not of analyticity.
I do not mean to suggest that Carnap is under any illusions on this
point. His simplified model language with its state�descriptions is aimed
primarily not at the general problem of analyticity but at another pur�
pose, the clarification of probability and induction. Our problem, h ow�
ever, is analyticity; and here the major difficulty lies not in the first class
of analytic statements, the logical truths, but rather in the second class,
which depends on the n otion of synonymy.
2. Definition

There are those who find it soothing to say that the analytic statements
of the second class reduce to those of the first class, the logical truths, by

definitioll; 'bachelor,' for example, is defined as ' unmarried man . ' But
how do we find that 'bachelor' is defined as 'unmarried man ? ' Who de­
fined it th us, and when? Are we to appeal to the nearest dictiona ry, and
accept the lexicographer's formulation as law? Clea r l y th is would be to
put the cart before the horse. 'rhe lexicographer is an empirical scientist,
whose busi ness is the recording of antecedent facts; and if he glosses
' bachelor' as 'unmarried man' it is because of his belief that there is a re­
lation of synonymy between those forms, implicit in general or preferred
usage prior to his own work. The notion of synonym v presupposed
here has sti ll to be clarified, presumably in terms relating to linguistic
behavior. Certainly the " definiti o n " which is the l exicographer's report
o f an observed synonymy cannot be taken as the ground of the syn­
onynly.
Definition is not, indeed, an activity excl usively of philologists. Philos­
ophers and scientists frequently have occasion to " define" a recondite
term by paraphrasing it into terms of a more familiar vocabulary. But or­
dinarily slIch a definition, like the philologist's, is p u re lexicography, af­
firming a relation of synonymy antecedent to the exposition in lund.
Just what it means to affirm synonymy, just what the interconnections
may be which a re necessary and s u flicient in order that two linguistic
forms be properly describable as synonymous, is far from clear; but,
whatever these interconnections may be, ordinarily they are gro u nded in
usage. Definitions repo rting selected instances of synonymy come then
as reports upon usage.
There is also, however, a variant type of definitional activity which
docs not limit itself to the reporting of pre-existing synonymies. I have in
mind what Carnap calls eX/J{ication-an activity to which philosophers
are given, and scientists also in their more philosophical moments. I n ex­
plication the purpose is not merely to paraphrase the deliniendum into
an outright synonym, but actually to improve upon the definiendum
by refining or supplementing its meaning. But even explication, though
not merely reporting a pre-existing synonymy hetween definiendum and
deliniens, does rest nevertheless on other pre-existing synonymies. The
matter may be viewed as follows. Any word worth explicating has some
contexts which, as wholes, are clear and precise enough to be usefu l ; and
the purpose o f explication is to preserve the usage of these favored con­
texts while sharpening the usage of other contexts. I n order that a given
definition be suitable for purposes of explication, therefore, what is re­
quired is not that the definiendull1 in its antecedent usage be synony­
mous with the definiens, hut JUS! that each of these favored contexts of

35

36

Q U I N T F S S F N C l'

the definiendum, taken as a whole in its antecedent usage, be synony­
mous with the co rresponding context of the definiens.
Two a lternative definientia may be equally appropriate for the pur­
poses of a given task of explication a n d yet not be synonymous with
each other; for they may serve interchangeably within the favored con­
texts but diverge elsewhere. Bv cleaving to one of these definientia rather
than the other, a definition of explicative kind generates, by fiat, a rela­
tion of synonymy between definiendum and definiens which did not hold
before. But such a definition still owes its explicative function, as seen, to
pre-existing synonytnies.
There docs, however, remain still a n extreme sort o f definition which
docs not hark back to prior synonym ies at all: namely, the explicitly con­
ventional introduction of novel notations for purposes of sheer a bbrevi­
ation. lIere the definiendum becomes synonymous with the definiens
simply because it has been created expressly for the purpose of being
synonymous with the definiens. lIere we have a real l y transparent case
o f synoll Vmy created by definition; would that all species of synonymy
were as intelligi ble. For the rest, definition rests on synonymy rather
than explaining it.
The word 'definition' has come to have a dangerously reassuring
sound, owing no doubt to its frequent occurrence in logical and mathe­
matical writings. We shall do well to digress now into a brief appraisal of
the role o f definition in formal work.
I n logical and mathematical systems either of two mutually antago­
nistic types of economy may be striven for, and each has its peculiar
practical util ity. O n t h e o n e h a n d w e m a y seek economy of practical ex­
pression-ease and brevity in the statement of multifarious relations.
This sort of economy calls usually for distinctive concise notations for a
wealth of concepts. Second, however, a n d oppositely, we may seek econ­
omy i n grammar and vocabulary; we may try to find a minimum of basic
concepts such that, once a distinctive notation has been appropriated to
each of them, it becomes possible to express any desired further concept
by mere combination and iteration o f our basic notations. This second
sort o f economy is impractical in one way, since a poverty in basic idi­
oms tends to a necessary lengthening of discourse. But it is practical in
another way: It greatly simplifies theoretical discourse about the lan­
guage, through minimizing the terms and the forms of construction
wherein the language consists.
Both sorts o f economy, though prima facie incompatible, arc valuable
in their ,cpa rate ways. The custom has consequently arisen of combin-

Tv.'o Dogmas of EmpiriC1�m

ing both sorts of economy by forging in effect two languages, the one a
part of the other. The inclusive language, though redundant in grammar
and vocabulary, is economical in message lengths, while the part, called
primitive notation, is economical in grammar and vocabulary. Whole
and part a re correlated by rules of translation whereby each idiom not in
primitive notation is equated to some complex built up of primitive no­
tation. These rules of translation are the so-called definitions which ap­
pear in formalized systems . They are best viewed not as adj uncts to one
language but as correlations between two languages, the one a part of
the other.
But these correlations are not arbitrary. They a rc supposed to show
how the primitive notations can accomplish all purposes, save brev­
ity and convenience, of the redundant language. Hence the definiendum
and its definiens may be expected, in each case, to be related in one
or another of the three ways lately noted. The definiens may be a faith­
ful paraphrase of the definiendum into the narrower notation, preserv­
ing a direct synonymy' as of antecedent usage; or the definiens may,
in the spirit of explication, improve upon the antecedent usage of the
definiendum; or finally, the definiendum may be a newly created nota­
tion, newly endowed with meaning here and now.
In formal and informal work alike, thus, we find that definition­
except in the extreme case of the explicitly conventional introduction
of new notations-hinges on prior rclations o f synonyll1y. Recognizing
then that the notion of definition does not hold the key to synonymy and
analyticity, let us look further into synonymy and say no more of defini­
tion.
3. Interchangea b i l ity

A natural suggestion, deserving close examination, is that the synonymy
of two linguistic forms consists simply in their interchangeability in all
contexts without change of truth value-interchangeability, in Leibniz's
phrase, salva veritate.' Note that synonyms so conceived need not even
be free from vagueness, as long as the vagucnesses match.
But it is not quite true that the synonyms 'bachelor' and 'unmarried

man' are everywhere interchangeable salva veritate. Truths which be­
come false under substitution of ' u nmarried man' for ' bachelor' are eas­
ily constructed with the help of ' bachelor of arts' or 'bachelor's b uttons';
also with the help of quotation, thus:
'Bachelor' has less than ten letters.
Such coullterinstances can, however, perhaps be set aside by treating the
phrases 'bachelor of arts' and 'bachelor's huttons' and the quotation
" bachelor" each as a single indivisible word and then stipulating that
the interchangeability salva veritate which is to be the touchstone of syn­
onymy is not supposed to apply to fragmentary occurrences inside of
a word. This account of synonymy, supposing it acceptable on other
counts, has indeed the drawback of appealing to a prior conception of
"word" which can be counted on to present difficulties of formulation in
its turn. Nevertheless some progress might be claimed i n having reduced
the problem of synonymy to a problem of wordhood. Let us pursue this
line a bit, taking "word" for granted.
The question remains whether interchangeability salva veritate ( ap­
parent from occurrences with in words ) is a strong enough condition for
synonymy, or whether, on the contrary, some heteronymous expressions
mighT be thus interchangeable. Now let us be clear that we are not con­
cerned here with synonymy in the sense of complete identity in psycho­
logical associations or poetic quality; indeed no two expressions arc syn­
onymous in such a sense. We are concerned only with what may be
called cognitive syn onymy. Just what this is cannot be said without suc­
cessfully finishing the present study; but we know something about it
from the need which a rose for it in connection with analyticity in § 1 .
The sort of synonymy needed there was merely such that any analytic
statement could be turned into a logical truth by putting synonyms for
synonyms. Turning the tables and assuming analyticity, indeed, we could
explain cognitive synonymy of terms as follows ( k eeping to the familiar
exampl e ) : to say that ' hachelor' and 'unmarried man' a re cognitively
synonymous is to say no more nor less than that the statement:

All and only bachelors are unmarried men

Two Dogmas of Empl rlLism

What we need is an account of cognitive synonymy not presuppos­
ing analyticity-if we arc to explain analyticity conversely with help
of cognitive synonymy as undertaken in § 1. And indeed sllch an in­
dependent account of cognitive synonymy is at present up for consid­
eration, namely, interchangeability salva veritate everywhere except
within words. The question before us, to resume the thread at last, is
whether such interchangeability is a sufficient conditio !l for cognitive
synonymy. We can quickly assure ourselves that it is, by examples of the
following sort. The statement:
(4)

Necessarily all and only bachelors are bachelors

is evidently true, even supposing 'necessarily' so narrowlv construed as
to be truly applicable only to analytic statements. Then, i f ' hachelor' and
'unmarried man' are interchangea ble salva veritate, the result:
(5)

Necessarily a l l a n d only bachelors are unmarried men

of putting 'unmarried man' for an occurrence of ' bachelor' in (4) must,
like ( 4 ) , be true. But to say that ( 5 ) is true is to say that ( 3 ) is analytic,
and hence that 'bachelor' and 'unmarried man' arc cognitivcly synony­
mous.
Let us sec what there is ahout the above a rgument that gives it its air
of hocus-pocus. The condition of interchangeabil ity salva veritate varies
in its force with variations in the richness of the language at hand. The
above argument supposes we are working with a language rich enough
to contain the adverb 'necessarily, ' this adverh being so construed as to
yield truth when and only when applied to an analytic statemen t. But
can we condone a language which contains such an adverb? Does the ad­
verb really make sense? To suppose that it does is to suppose that we
have already made satisfactory sense of 'analytic. ' Then what a r e w e s o
hard at work on right now?
Our argument is not flatly circular, but something like it. It has the
form, figuratively speaking, of a closed curve in space.
Interchangeability salva veritate is meaningless until relativized to a
language whose extent is specified in relevant respects. Suppose now we
consider a language containing j ust the following materials. There is an
this notion IS at hand, a narrower sense of cogOltlve synonymy whICh IS prefer<-l hle
for some pu rposes can in turn be derived. But thiS speeul ranllficatJon of concept­
building lies aside from the present purposes and must not be confused \vlth the
broad sort of cogl1Jtive synonymy here concerned.

indefinitely large stock of one-place predicates ( for example, 'F' where
'Fx' means that x is a man) and many-place predicates ( for example, ' G '
where ' Gxy ' means that x loves y ) , mostly having t o do with extra logical
subj ect matter. The rest of the language is logical. The atomic sentences
consist each of a predicate followed hy one or more variables 'x; 'y,'
etc.; and the complex sentences are built up of the atomic ones by truth
functions ( ' not,' 'and,' 'or; etc . ) and quantification.R In effect such a lan­
guage enjoys the benefits also of descriptions and indeed singular terms
generally, these being contextually definable in known ways.' Even ab­
stract singular terms naming classes, classes of classes, etc., arc contextu­
ally definable in case the assumed stock of predicates includes the two­
place predicate o f class membership. l O Such a language can be adequate
to classical mathematics and indeed to scientific discourse generally, ex­
cept in so far as the latter involves debatable devices such as contrary-to­
fact conditionals or modal adverbs like 'necessarily. ' 11 Now a language
of this type is extensional, in this sense: any two predicates which agree
extensionally ( that is, are true of the same obj ects ) arc interchangeable
salva veritate. 1 2
Tn an extensional language, therefore, interchangeability salva veritate
is no assurance of cognitive synonymy of the desired type. That 'bache­
lor' and 'unmarried man' are interchangeable salva veritate in an exten­
sional language assures us of no more than that ( 3 ) is true. There is no
assurance here that the extensional agreement of ' bachelor' and 'unmar­
ried man' rests on meaning rather than merely on accidental matters of
fact, as does the extensional agreement of 'creature with a heart' and
'creature with k idneys .'
For m o st purposes extensional agreement is t h e nearest approxima­
tion to synonymy we need care about. But the fact remains that ex­
tensional agreement falls far short of cognitive synonymy of the type

required for explaining analyticity in the manner of § 1 . The type o f cog­
nitive synonymy required there is such as to equate the synonymy of
'bachelor' and 'unmarried man' with the analyticity of ( 3 ) , not merely
with the truth of ( 3 ) .
S o w e must recognize that interchangeability salva veritate, if con­
strued in relation to a n extensional language, is not a sufficient comli­
tion of cognitive synonymy in the sense needed for deriving analyticity in
the manner of § 1. If a language contains an intensional adverb ' necessar­
ily' in the sense lately noted, or other particles to the same effect, then
interchangeability salva veritate in such a language does afford a suf­
ficient condition of cognitive synonymy; but such a language is intelligi­
ble only in so far as the notion of analyticity is already understood in ad­
vance.
The effort to explain cognitive synonymy first, for the sake of deriving
analyticity from it afterward as in § 1 , is perhaps the wrong approach.
Instead we might try explaining analyticity somehow without appeal
to cognitive synonymy. Afterward we could doubtless derive cognitive
synonymy fro m analyticity satisfactorily enough if desired. We have seen
that cognitive synonymy of 'bachelor' and 'unmarried man' can be ex­
plained as analyticity of ( 3 ) . The same explanation works for any pair of
one-place predicates, of course, and it can be extended in obvious fash­
ion to many-place predicates. Other syntactical categories can also b e
accommodated in fairly parallel fashion. Singular terms may be s a i d t o
he cognitively synonymous w h e n t h e statement of identity formed by
putting ' = ' between them is analytic. Statements may he said simply to
be cognitively synonymous when their biconditional (the result of j oin­
ing them by 'if and only if') is analytic . l ; If we care to lump all categories
into a single formulation, at the expense of assuming again the notion of
" word " which was appealed to early in this section, we can describe any
two linguistic forms as cognitively synonymous when the two forms
are interchangeable ( apart from occurrences within " words " ) salva ( n o
longer veritate b u t ) analyticitate. Certain technical questions arise, i n ­
d e e d , o v e r c a s e s of ambiguity or homonymy; l e t us not p a u s e for them,
however, for we are already digressing. Let us rather turn our backs
on the problem of synonymy and address ourselves anew to that of
analyticity.

4 . Semantic a l Rules

Analyticity at first seemed most naturally definable by appeal to a realm
of meanings. On refinement, the appeal to meanings gave way to an ap­
peal to synonymy or definition. But definition turned out to be a will-o'­
the-wisp, and synonymy turned out to be best understood only by dint
of a prior appeal to analyticity itself. So we are back at the problem of
analyticity.
r do not know whether the statement 'Everything green is extended' is
ana lytic. Now does my indecision over this example really betray an
incomplete understanding, an incomplete grasp of the " meanings , " of
'green' and 'extended ? ' I think not. The trouble is not with 'green' or 'ex­
tended,' but with 'analytic . '
It is often hinted that t h e difficulty in separating analytic statements
from synthetic ones in ordinary language is due to the vagueness of ordi­
nary language and that the distinction is clear when we have a precise ar­
tificial language with explicit " semantical rules . " This, however, as I
shall now attempt to show, is a confusion.
The notion of analyticity about which we arc worrying is a purported
rclatioo between statements and languages: a statement S is said to be
analytiC fcn a language t, and the problem is to make sense of this rela­
tion generally, that is, for variable 'S' and 'L.' The gravity of this prob­
lem is not perceptibly less for artificial languages than for natural ones.
The problem of making sense of the idiom 'S is analytic for L , ' with vari­
able 'S' and ' L ,' retains its stub bornness even if we limit the range of the
varia ble ' L' to artificial languages. Let me now try to make this point evi­
dent.
For a rtificial languages and seman tical rules we look naturally to the
writings of Carnap. His seman tical rules take various forms, and to
make Ill y point I shall have to distinguish certain of the forms. Let us
suppose, to begin with, a n artificial language to whose semantical rules
have the form explicitly of a specification, by recursion or otherwise, of
all the analytic statements o f Lo. The rules tell us that such and such
statements, and only those, are the analytic statements of L". Now here
the difficulty is simply that the rules contain the word 'analytic,' which
we do not understand! We understand what expressions the rules attri­
bute analyticity to, but we do not understand what the rules attribute to
those expressions. In short, before we can understand a rule which be­
gins 'A statement S is analytic for language to if and only if . . . ,' we must

Two Dogmas of EmplrlCl<.., m

understand the genera l relative term 'ana lytic for'; we must understand
'S is analytic for L' where 'S' and ' L' are \Cariables.
Alternatively we may, indeed, view the so-called rule as a conventional
definition o f a new simple symbol 'analvtic-for- L,,; which might better
he written untendentiously as 'K' so as not to seem to throw light on the
interesting word 'analytic . ' O hviouslv any number of classes K, M, N,
etc. of statements of L" can he specified for various purposes or for no
purpose; what does it mean to say that K, as against M , N, etc . , is the
class of the " a na lytic " statements of L,, ?
By saying what statements are analytic for Ic" we explain 'analytic-for­
t,,' but not 'an,llytic; not 'analytic for. ' We do not begin to explain the
idiom 'S is analytic for L' with variable 'S' and ' L. , ' even if we are content
to limit the range of ' I.' to the realm of a rtificial languages.
Actuallv we do know enough about the intended significance of 'ana­
lytic' to know that analytic statements are supposed to he true. Let us
then turn to a second form of semantical rule, which savs not that such
and such st,ltements arc analytic but simply that such and such state­
ments arc included among the truths. Such a rule is not subject to the
criticism o f containing the un-understood word 'analytic'; and we may
grant for the sake of argument that there is no difficulty over the broader
term 'true.' A semantical rule o f this second type, a rule of truth, is not
supposed to specify all the truths of the language; it merely stipulates, re­
cursively or otherwise, a certain multitude of statements which, along
with others unspecified, a re to count as true. Such a rule may be con­
ceded to be quite clear. Derivatively, afterward, analyticity can be demar­
cated thus: a statement is analytic if it is ( not merely true but) true ac­
cording to the semantical rule.
Still there is really no progress. Instead of appealing to an unexplained
word 'analytic,' we arc now appealing to an unexplained phrase 'seman­
tical rule. ' Not every true statement which says that the statements of
some class are true can count as a semantical rule-otherwise all truths
would be " a n a l ytic" in the sense of being true according to semantical
rules. Semantical rules are distinguishable, apparently, only bv the fact
of appearing on a page under the heading 'Semantical Rules'; and this
heading is itself then meaningless.
We can say indeed that a statement is allalytlc-f()r-l.1I if and only if it
is true according to such and such specifically appended " sema ntic.ll
ruies , " but then we fi nd ourselves back at essentially the ",me case which
was originally discussed: 'S is analytic-for-L" if and only if . . . ' Once we

Q U I N T F S S E ]'; C r:

seek to explain 'S is ana lytic for L' generally for variahle ' L' ( even a llow­
ing limitation of ' L' to artificial language s ) , the explanation 'true accord­
ing to the seman tical rules of L' is unavailing; for the relative term 'seman­
tica l rule of' is as much in need of clarification, at least, as 'analytic for. '
It may be instructive to compare the notion of semantical rule with
that of postulate. Relative to a given set of postulates, it is easy to say
what a postulate is: it is a member of the set. Rel ative to a given set of se­
mantical rules, it is equally easv to say what a semantical rule is. But
given simplv a notation, mathematical or otherwise, and indeed as thor­
oughly understood a notation as you please in point o f the translations
or truth conditions of its statements, who can say which of its true state­
ments rank as postu lates ? O bviously the q uestion is meaningless�as
meaningless as asking which points in Ohio are starting points. Any
finite (or effectively specifiable infinite) selectio n of statements (prefera­
bly true ones, perhaps) is as much a set of postulates as any other. The
word ' postulate' is significant only relative to an act of inquiry; we apply
the word to a set of statements j ust in so far as we happen, for the year or
the moment, to be thinking of those statements i n relation to the state­
ments which can be reach ed from them by some set of transformations
to which we have seen fit to direct our attention. Now the notion of se­
mantical rule is as sensible and meaningful as that of postulate, if con­
ceived in a similarly relative spirit�relative, this time, to one or another
pa rticu lar enterprise of schooling unconversant persons in sufficient con­
ditions for truth of statements of some natural or artificial language L.
But from this point of view no one signalization of a subclass of the
truths of L is intrinsically more a semantical rule than another; and, if
'analytic' means 'true by semantical rules,' no one truth of L is analytic
to the exclusion of another. ' 1
It might conceivably b e protested that a n artificial language L ( unlike
a natural o n e) is a language in the ordinary sense plus a set of explicit se­
mantical ndes�the whole constituting, let us say, an ordered pair; and
that the semantical rules of L then ace specifiable simply as the second
component of the pair L. Bur, hy the same token and more simply,
we might construe an artificial language 1. outright as an ordered pair
whose second component is the class of its analytic statements; and then
the analvtic statements of L become specifiahle simply as the statements

Not a l l the explanations of analyticity known to Carnap and his read­
ers have been covered explicitly in the a bove considerations, but the e x ­
tension to other forms is not h a r d t o s e e . J u s t one additional betor
should be mentioned which sometimes enters: sometimes the semantical
rules are in e ffect rules of translation into ordinary language, in which
case the analytic statements of the artificial language are in effect recog­
nized as such from the analyticity of their specified translations in ordi­
nary language. I [ere certainly there can be no thought of an illumination
of the prohlem of analyticity from the side of the artificial language.
From the point of view of the pro blem of analyticity the notion of an
artificia l language with seman tical rules is a feu ( Jllet par excelleHce. Se­
mantical rules determining the a nalytic statements of an artificial lan­
guage are of interest only in so far as we already understand the notion
of analyticity; they are of no help in gaining this understanding.
Appeal to hypothetical languages of an artificially simple kind could
conceivably be useful in clarifying analyticity, if the mental or behavioral
or cultural factors relevant to a nalyticity�whatever they may be�werc
somebow sketched into the simplified model. But a model which takes
analyticity merely as an irreducible character is unlikely to throw light
on the problem of explicating analyticity.
It is obvious that truth is general depends on hoth language and extra­
linguistic fact. The statement 'Brutus killed Caesar' would be fa lse if the
world had been different in certain ways, but it would also be false if the
word 'killed' happened rather to have the sense of 'begat. · Thus one is
tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow
analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given
this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the
factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statemenh.
But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and
synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a dis­
tinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empi ricists, a
metaphysical a rticle of faith.
5. The Ve rification Theory and Reducti o n i s m

In the course of these somber reflections we have taken a dim view first
of the notion of meaning, then of the notion of cognitive synonymy,
and finally of the notion of analyticity. But what, it may he asked, of

45

the verification theory of mea ning? This phrase has established itself so
firmly as a catchword of empIricism that we should be very u nscientific
indeed not to look beneath it for a possible key to the problem of mean­
ing and the associated problems.
The verification theory of meaning, which has been conspicuous i n the
literature from Peirce onward, is that the meaning of a statement is the
method of empirically confirming or infirming it. An analytic statement
is that limiting case which is confirmed no matter what.
As urged in § 1, we can as well pass over the question of meanings as
entities and move straight to sameness of meaning, or synonymy. 'fhen
what the verification theory says is that statements are synonymous if
and only if they are alike in point of method of empirical confirmation or
infirmation.
This is an account of cognitive synonymy not of linguistic forms gen­
erally, but of statements . " However, from the concept of synonymy of
statements we could derive the concept of synonymy for other linguistic
forms, by considerations somewhat similar to those at the end of § .1 . As­
suming the notion of "word, " indeed, we could explain any two forms
as synonymous when the putting of the one form for an occurrence of
the other in any statement ( apart from occurrences within " words " )
yields a synonymous statement. Finally, given the concept of synonymy
thus for linguistic forms generally, we could define analyticity in terms of
synonymy and logical truth as in § l . for that matter, w e could define
analyticity more simply in terms of j ust synonymy of statements together
with logical truth; it is not necessary to appeal to synonymy of linguistic
forms other than statements. For a statement may he descrihed as ana­
lytic simply when it is synonymous with a logically true statement.
So, if the verification theory can be accepted as an adequate account of
statement synonymy, the notion of analyticity is saved after all. How­
ever, let us reflect. Statement synonymy is said to he likeness of method

of empirical confirmation or infirmation . .Just what are these methods
which are to he compared for likeness? What, in other words, is the na­
ture of the relation hetween a statement and the experiences which con­
tribute to or detract from its confirmatio n ?
The m o s t naive v i e w of t h e relation is t h a t it is one of direct report.
This is radical reductionism. Every meaningful statement is held to be
translatable i nto a statement ( true or false) about immediate experience.
Radical reductionism, in one form or another, well antedates the veri­
fication theory of meaning explicitly so called. 'fhus Locke and Hume
held that every idea must either originate directly in sense experience or
else be compounded of ideas thus originating; and taking a hint from
Tooke we might rephrase this doctrine in semantical j argon by saying
that a term, to be significant at all, must he either a name o f a sense da­
tum or a compound of such names or an abbreviation of such a com­
pound. So stated, the doctrine remains ambiguous as between sense data
as sensory events and sense data as sensory qualities; and it remains
vague as to the admissible ways of compou nding. Moreover, the doc­
trine is unnecessarily and intolerably restrictive in the term-by-term cri­
tique which it imposes. More reasonably, and without yet exceeding the
limits of what I have called radical reductionism, we may take full state­
ments as our significant units-thus demanding that our statements as
wholes be translatable into sense-datum language, but not that they be
translata ble term by term.
This emendation wOllld unqllestionably have been welcome to I.ocke
and Hume and 'fooke, but historically it had to await an important re­
orientation in semantics-the reorientation whereby the primary veh icle
o f meaning came to be seen no longer in the term but in the statement.
'fhis reorientation, seen in Bentham and rrege, u nderlies Russel l's con­
cept of incomplete symbols defined in use; \(' also it is impl icit i n the
verification theory of meaning, since the obj ects of verification are state­
lTICnts.
Radical reductionism, conceived now with statements as units, set it­
self the task of specifying a sense-datum language and showing how to
translate the rest of significant discourse, statement by statement, i nto it.
Carnap embarked on this project in the A u/bau.
The language which Carnap adopted as his starting point was not a
sense-datum language in the narrowest conceivable sense, for it included
1 6 . See below IChaptcT 9 1 .

47

also the notations of logic, up through higher set theory. In effect it in­
cluded the whole language of pure mathematics. The ontology implicit
in it ( that is, the range of values of its variables) embraced not only sen­
sory events but classes, classes of classes, and so on. Empiricists there are
who would boggle at such prodigality. Carnap's starting point is very
parsimonious, however, in its extra logical or sensory part. In a series of
constructions in which he exploits the resources of modern logic with
much ingenuity, Carnap succeeds in defining a wide array of important
additional sensory coucepts which, but for his constructions, one would
not have dreamed were definable o n so slender a basis. lie was the first
empiricist who, not content with asserting the reducibility of science to
terms of immediate experience, took serious steps toward carrying out
the reduction.
If Carnap's starting point is satisfactory, still his constructions were, as
he himself stressed, only a fragment of the full program. The construc­
tion of even the simplest statements about the physical world was left
in a sketchy state. Carnap's suggestions on this subject were, despite
their sketchiness, very suggestive. He explained spatio-temporal point­
instants as quadruples of real numbers and envisaged assignment of
sense qualities to point-instants according to certain canons. Roughly
summarized, the plan was that qualities should be assigned to point-in­
stants i n such a way as to achieve the laziest world compatible with our
experience. The principle of least action was to be our guide i n con­
structing a world from experience.
Carnap did not seem to recognize, however, that his treatment of
physical obj ects fell short of reduction not merely through sketchiness,
but in principle. Statements of the form 'Quality q is at point-instant
x;y;z;t' were, according to his canons, to be apportioned truth values in
such a way as to maximize and minimize certain over-all features, and
with growth of experience the truth values were to be progressively re­
vised in the same spirit. I think this is a good schematization (deliber­
ately oversimplified, to be sure) of what science really docs; but it pro­
vides no indication, not even the sketchiest, of how a statement of the
fo rm 'Quality q is at x;y;z;t' could ever be translated into Carnap's initial
language of sense data and logic. The connective 'is at' remains an added
undefined connective; the canons counsel us in its use but not in its elimi­
nation .
Carnap seems to have appreciated this point afterward; for in his
later writings he abandoned all notion of the translatability of state-

Two Dogmas of Fmpiricism

ments a bout the physical world into statements about immediate experi­
ence. Reductionism in its radical form has long since ceased to figure in
Canup's philosophy.
flut the dogma of reductionism has, in a subtler and more tenuous
form, continued to i nfluence the thought of empiricists. The notion lin­
gers that to each statement, or each synthetic statement, there is associ­
ated a unique range of possible sensorv events such that the occurrence
of any of them would add to the likelihood of truth of the statement, and
that there is associated also another unique range of possible sensory
events whose occurrence would detract from that likelih ood. This no­
tion is of course implicit in the verification theory of meaning.
The dogma of reductionism survives in the supposition that each
statement, taken in isolation from its fellows, can admit of confirma­
tion or infirmation at all. My countersuggestion, issuing essentially from
Carnap's doctrine of the physical world in the Autbau, is that our state­
ments about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not
i ndividually but only as a corporate hody. ' ·
The dogma of reductionism, even in i t s attenuated form, i s intimatelv
connected with the other dogma-that there is a cleavage between the
analytic and the synthetic. We have found ourselves led, indeed, from the
latter problem to the fonner through the verification theory of meaning.
More directly, the one dogma clearly supports the other in this way: as
long as it is taken to be significant in general to speak of the confirmation
and infirmation of a statement, it seems significant to speak also o f a lim­
iting kind of statement which is vacuously confirmed, ifJS() (acto, come
what may; and such a statement is ana lytic.
The two dogmas a re, indeed, at root identical . We lately reflected that
in general the truth of statements does obviously depend both upon lan­
guage and upon extralinguistic fact; and we noted that this obvious cir­
cumstance carries in its train, not logica lly but all too naturally, a feeling
that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzahle i nto a linguistic
component and a factual component. The factual component must, if we
are empiricists, boil d own to a range of confirmatory experiences. In the
extreme case where the linguistic component is all that matters, a true
statement is analytic. Bur r hope we arc now impressed with how stub1 7. Th is doctnne \vas well argued by PIerre Duhem, La Th(}()ne phystque: SOH obJet

bornly the distinction between analytic and synthetic has resisted any
straightforward drawing. I am impressed also, apart from prefabricated
examples of hlack and white balls in an urn, with how baffling the prob­
lem has always been of arriving at any explicit theory of the empirical
confirmation of a synthetic statement. My present suggestion is that it is
nonsense, and the root of much nonsense, to speak of a linguistic com­
ponent and a factual component in the truth of any individual statement.
Taken collectively, science has its double dependence upon language and
experience; but this dua lity is not significantly traceable into the state­
ments of science taken one by one.
The idea of defining a symbol in use was, as remarked, an advance
over the impossible term-by-term empiricism of Locke and Hume. The
statement, rather tha n t h e term, came with Bentham to be recognized as
the unit accountable to an empiricist critique. But what I am now urging
is that even in taking the statement as unit we have drawn our grid too
finely. The unit of empirical significance is the whole o f science.
6 . Empiricism without the Dogmas

The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most casual
matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic
physics or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a man-made fabric
which impi nges on experience only along the edges. Or, to change the
figure, total science is like a field of force whose boundary conditions are
experience. A conflict with experience at the periphery occasions read­
j ustments in the interior of the field. Truth values have to be redistrib­
uted over some of our statements. Reevaluation of some statements en­
tails reevaluation of others, because of their logical interconnections­
the logical laws being in turn simply certain further statements of the
system, certain further elements of the field. Having reevaluated one
statement we must reevaluate some others, which may be statements
logically connected with the first or may be the statements of logical
connections themselves. But the total field is so underdetermined by its
boundary conditions, experience, that there is much latitude of choice as
to what statements to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary expe­
rience . No particular experiences arc linked with any particular state­
ments in the interior of the field, except indirectly through consider­
ations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole.
If this view is right, it is misleading to speak of the empirical content of
an individual statement-especially if it is a statement at all remote from

Two Dogmas of EmpiricI:)m

the experiential periphery of the field. Furthermore it becomes folly to
seck a boundary between synthetic statements, which bold contingently
on experience, and analytic statements, which hold come what may. Any
statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough
adj ustments elsewhere in the system. Even a statement very close to the
periphery can be held true in the face of recalcitrant experience bv plead­
ing hallucination or by amending certain statements of the kind called
logical laws. Conversely, by the same token, no statement is immune to
revision. Revision even of the logical law of the excluded middle has
been proposed as a means of simplifying quantum mechanics; and what
difference is there in principle between such a shift and the shift whereby
Kepler superseded Ptolemy, or Einstein Newton, or Darwin Aristotle ?
F o r vividness r h a v e b e e n speaking in terms of varying distances from
a sensory periphery. Let me try now to cla rify this notion without meta­
phor. Certain statements, though about physical obj ects and not sense
experience, seem peculiarly germane to sense experience-and in a selec­
tive way: some statements to some experiences, others to others. Such
statements, especially germane to particular experiences, I picture as
near the periphery. But in this relation of "germaneness" [ envisage noth­
ing more than a loose association reflecting the relative likelihood, in
practice, of our choosing one statement rather than another for revision
in the event of recalcitrant experience. For example, we can imagine re­
calcitrant experiences to which we would surely he inclined to accom­
modate our system by reevaluating j ust the statement that there are
brick houses on Elm Street, together with related statements on the same
topic. We can imagine other recalcitrant experiences to which we would
be inclined to accommodate our system by reevaluating j ust the state­
ment that there are no centaurs, along with kindred statements. A recal­
citrant experience can, I have urged, be accommodated by any of vari­
ous alternative reevaluations in various alternative quarters of the total
system; but, in the cases which we arc now imagining, our natural ten­
dency to disturb the total system as little as possihle would lead us to fo­
cus our revisions upon these specific statements concerning brick houses
or centaurs. These statements are felt, therefore, to have a sharper em­
pirical reference than highly theoretical statement> of phvsics or logic or
ontology. The latter statements may be thought of as relatively centrally
located within the total network, meaning merely that little prefermtial
connection with a ny particular sense data obtrudes itself.
As a n empiricist r continue to thin k of the conceptual scheme of sci­
ence as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of

51

Q U l i': T E S S E N C E

past experience. Physical obj ects are conceptually imported into the situ­
ation as convenient intermediaries-not by definition in terms of experi­
ence, bllt simply as irreducible posits " comparable, epistemologically, to
the gods of Homer. For my part J do, qua lay physicist, believe in physi­
cal obj ects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to
believe otherwise . But in point of epistemological footing the physical
obj ects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Hoth sorts of
entities enter our conception only as cultural posits. The myth of physi­
cal obj ects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved
more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable
structure into the flux of experience.
Positing does not stop with macroscopic physical obj ects. O bj ects at
the atomic level are posited to make the laws of macroscopic obj ects,
and ultimately the laws of experience, simpler and more manageable;
and we need not expect or demand full definition of atomic and sub­
atomic entities in terms of macroscopic ones, any more than definition of
macroscopic things in terms of sense data . Science is a continuation of
common sense, and it continues the common-sense expedient of swelling
ontology to simplify theory.
Physical obj ects, small and large, are not the only posits. Forces are
another example; and indeed we are told nowadays that the boundary
between energy and matter is obsolete. Moreover, the abstract entities
which arc the su bstancc of mathematics-ultimately classes and classes
of classes and so on up-are another posit in the same spirit. Epis­
temologically these are myths on the same footing with physical obj ects
and gods, neither better nor worse except for differences in the degree to
which they expedite our dealings with sense experiences.
The over-all algebra of rational and irrational numbers is underde­
termined by the algebra of rational numbers, but is smoother and more
convenient; and it includes the algebra of rational numbers as a j agged
or gerrymandered part. I "! Total science, mathematical and natural and
human, is similarly but more extremely underdetermined by experience.
The edge of the system must be kept squared with experience; the rest,
with all its ela borate myths or fictions, has as its o b jective the simplicity
of laws.
O ntological questions, under this view, are on a par with questions of

Two Dogmas of Empiricism

natural science .'ll Consider the question whether to countenance classes
as entities. This, as I have argued elsewhere,21 is the question whether to
quantify with respect to variables which take classes as values. Now
Carnap has maintained that this is a question not of matters of fact
but of choosing a convenient language form, a convenient conceptual
scheme or framework for science." With this I agree, but only on the
proviso that the same be conceded regarding scientific hypotheses gener­
a lly. Carnap has recognized that he is able to preserve a double standard
for ontological questions and scientific hypotheses only by assuming an
absolute distinction between the analytic and the synthetic; and I need
not say again that this is a distinction which I rejec!."
The issue over there being classes seems more a question of convenient
conceptual scheme; the issue over there being centaurs, or brick houses
on Elm Street, seems more a question of fact. But I have been urging
that this difference is only one of degree, and th at it turns upon our
vaguely pragmatic inclination to adjust one strand of the fabric of sci­
ence rather than another in accommodating some particular recalcitrant
experience. Conservatism figures in such choices, and so docs the quest
for simplicity.
Carnap, Lewis, and others take a pragmatic stand on the question of
choosing between language forms, scientific frameworks; but their prag­
matism leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the
synthetic. In repudiating such a boundary I espouse a more thorough
pragmatism. Each man is given a scientific heritage plus a continuing
barrage of sensory stimulation; and the considerations which guide him
in warping his scientific heritage to fit his continuing sensory promptings
are, where rational, pragmatic.

In restrospecting " Two Dogma s " r fi n d myself overshooting the mark hy
twenty years. I think hack to college days, 61 years ago. I majored in
mathematics and was doing my honors reading in mathematical logic, a
suhject that had not yet penetrated the O herlin curriculum. My new
love, in the platonic sense, was Whitehead and Russell's Principia Math­
ematica.
I was taken with the clear, clean incisiveness of its formulas. But this
was not true of its long introduction to volume 1, nor of some of the
explanatory patches of prose that were interspersed through the three
volumes. In those pages and passages the distinction between sign and
obj ect, or use and mention, was badly hlurred. Partly in consequence,
there was vague recourse to intensional properties, or ideas, under the
disarmingly technical name of propositional functions. These ill-con­
ceived mentalistic notions paraded as the philosophical foundation for
the clean-cut classes, truth functions, and quantification that would have
been a fa r hetter starting point in their own right.
The distrust of mentalistic semantics that found expression in "Two
Dogma s " is thus detectable as far hack as my senior year in college. Even
earlier I had taken kindly to John B. Watson's Psychology from the
Standpoint or a Behaviorist, which Raymond Stetson had assigned to us
in his psychology class. Nor do I recall that it shocked any preconcep­
tions. It chimed in with my predilections.
In 1 9.3 1 , m y second year out o f college, I was writing my PhD thesis

under Whitehead's sponsorship at Harvard. It is my fi rst and latest book:
fi rst because I wrote it before the others, and latest because it wa� pub­
lished only a few months ago. Garland Publishing Company included
it in their recently conceived series of twentieth-century Harvard PhD
theses in philosophy. They did a surprisingly tidy job of my painfully
wrought typescript, replete with logical symbols. I'm tickled. But this is
not a commercial. The book is expensive, and I can offer better one;.
The relevance of my PhD thesis to our present topic is that in it I re­
worked the foundations of Prmcipza Mathematica i n strictly extensional
terms, and propositional functions to the winds. The term 'propositional
function' carried over, but to denote strictly classes, as I would now
p h rase it.
I was not abetted in m} extensionalism b y the Harvard professors of
that time. Whitehead, C. l . Lewis, H. M. Sheffer, and E . V . Huntington
a l l were soft on intensions and introspective meanings . But a postdoc­
toral fellowship the next year took me to a kindred spirit in Czechoslo­
vakia: the great Carnap. He was j ust finishing his Logische Syntax der
Sprache, and I read it and discussed it with him as it i;sued from his wife's
typewriter. He was setting his face steadfastly against modal logic and
mentalistic talk of meanings. His little logic text Abriss der LOglstik had
likewise been impeccably extensional, as was his impressive application
of mathematical logic to epistemology in D er loglsche Aufbau der Welt.
True, in L oglsche Syntax we find him making capital of a purported
distinction between analytic and synthetic truths. He didn't see this as
a reinstatement o f mentalistic meanings. He saw it as a matter of truth
by linguistic convention. I expressed misgivings already in our discus­
sions there in Prague, March 1 93 3 . Neil Tennant has uncovered, in the
Carnap archives in Pittsburgh, this entry in Carnap's unpublished j ot­
tings of the time. I transl ate Carnap's somewhat telegraphic German :

lectures on Carnap that I gave at Harvard in 1 934 were abjectly sequa-

cious. But my misgivings surfaced again in 1 93 5 , when I wrote "Truth
by Conventi o n . " I quote the end o f the first paragraph:
[D ]evelopments of the past few decades have led to a widespread con­
viction that logic and mathematics are purely analytic or conventional.
It is less the purpose o f the present inquiry to question the validity of
this contrast than to question its seme.
Carnap wrote to me in 1 93 6 expressing " very much interest" in
"Truth by Convention , " and added that he was " very keen of discussing
it when we meet i n Apri l . " So I have no record of his reaction, not re­
membering the discussion. There may have he en frequent discussions,
for he was around Harvard all that summer.
I was diverging from Carnap because his aloofness from intensions
and mentalism, which had so appealed to me, had proved to be insuf­
ficiently a ustere. Ironically, in those same years Carnap came to welcome
intensions increasingly. The trend began when Tarski persuaded him
that his "Thesis of Synta x " was untenahle: the thesis that " philosophy is
the syntax of the la nguage of science . " SemantIcs was wanted, not j ust
syntax. Tarski was right, in his own a ustere sense of semantics, namely
model theory and his theory o f truth. But Carnap went further, even em­
broiling himself in modal logic . I learned of this in 1 93 8 from Hempel,
and wrote to Carnap in dismay. He duly pondered my sermon, so he
wrote in reply, and he went on to defend himself as follows:
Although we do not ordinarily like to apply intensional la nguages, nev­
ertheless I think we cannot help ana lyzing them. What would you think
of an entomologist who refuses to investigate flees [sic] and lice because
he disli kes them?
Well, the fleas and lice p roved addictive. By 1 946 he was championing
modal logic.
Carnap was again at Harvard in the fall and winter term of 1 940--4 1 ,
along with Tarski and Russell. Glorious days. Tarksi a n d I argued persis­
tently with Carnap over his a p peal to analyticity in the opening pages of
his work in progress, Introduction to Semantics.
You don't write when you can meet and talk. I find nothing on analy­
ticity and meaning in my correspondence with Carnap until 1 94 3 , when
I was in Washington as a naval officer. I wrote him a long letter about his
Introduction to Semantics. One issue was analyticity and another was
my criterion o f ontological commitment as applied to a bstract objects.

Two Dogmas 111 Retro;pect
The two issues were linked, for Carnap viewed his appeal to a bstract ob­
j ects as empty convention, and their quasi-existence analytic.
I had not thought to look on my strictures over analyticity a� the stuff
of revolution. It was mere criticism, a negative point with no suggestion
of a bright replacement. I had not felt moved to follow "Truth by Con­
vention " with more of the same. But word got around. Nelson Good­
man had j oined in some of the discussions of 1 940-4 1 with Carnap,
Tarski and me. I n June and July of 1 94 7 a triangular correspondence on
the issue developed among Goodman, Morton White, and me. In 1 95 0 I
was invited by the program committee of the American Philosophical
Association to present a paper on the subject at the December meeting
here in Toronto. Hence "Two Dogmas . " It is remarkable that my most
contested and anthologized paper was an assignment. The response was
quick and startling. The paper appeared i n Philosophical ReVIew a few
weeks after the Toronto meeting, and four months later there were sym­
posia on it in Boston and at Stanford.
Looking back on it, one thing I regret is my needlessly strong state­
ment of holism.
The unit of empirica l significance is the whole of science
. Any �tate­
ment can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough ad­
j ustments . . . . Conversely . . . no statement is immune to revision.
. . .

This is true enough in a legalistic sort of way, but it diverts attention
from what is more to the point: the varying degrees of proximity to ob­
servation, the example of the brick houses in Elm Street. In later writings
I have invoked not the whole of science but chunks of it, clusters of sen­
tences j ust i nclusive enough to have critical semantic mass. By this I
mean a cluster sufficient to imply an o bservable effect of an observable
experimental condition.
I formulate the matter nowadays in terms of what I call observation
categoricals. An observation categorical is a generalization of the form
'Whenever this, that' where 'this' and 'that' are o bservation sentences .
I 'll say more about observation sentences later. Now a cluster of sen­
tences has critical semantic mass if it implies an observation categorical;
and the experimental check of the cluster of sentences consists in testing
the implied categorical by arranging for fulfillment of its observable
protasis and seeing whether the apodasis is realized.
This is meant as a schematic caricature of the experiment a l method. In
practice many sentences of the cluster are tacit and some are probabilis-

57

tic or dependent on unspecified things being equal. But I think it catches
the essence of experimental testing, and therewith of empirical content.
I have appealed here to implication: the cluster of sentences implies
the observation categorical. In so doing I give logic a special status: logi­
cal implication is the link between theory and experiment. However, we
remain free here to adjust and to vary the limits of what to count as
logic.
Thus consider the law of excluded middle, which I cited in "Two
Dogmas" to illustrate my claim that 'no statement is immune to revi­
sio n . ' I f the prospect of simplification and clarification at the level of
quantum physics were to prove so overwhelming as to induce us to abro­
gate the law of excluded middle, we could still do so. It would j ust mean
setting the limits of what to count as logic very narrowly and reckoning
the law of excluded middle to the cl usters of defeasible hypotheses that
do the implying.
In a footnote to "Two Dogmas " I noted Duhem's priority in stressing
holism. As a matter of curiosity, however, I might mention that when
I wrote and presented " Two Dogmas " here forty years ago, and pub­
lished it in the Philosophical R eview, I didn't know about Duhem. Both
Hempel and Philipp Frank subsequently brought Duhem to my atten­
tion, so I inserted the footnote when " Two Dogmas " was reprinted in
From a Logical Point of View. Another insert was page 35 on postulates,
which was prompted by a paper by Richard Martin in defense of Carnap
on analyticity. But that was explained in a footnote.
I think Carnap's tenacity to analyticity was due largely to his philoso­
phy of mathematics. One problem for him was the lack of empirical con­
tent: how could an empiricist accept mathematics as meaningful? An­
other problem was the necessity of mathematical truth. Analyticity was
his answer to both.
I answer both with my moderate holism. Take the first problem: lack
of content. Insofar as mathematics gets applied in natural sciences, I see
it as sharing empirical content. Sentences of pure arithmetic and differ­
ential calculus contribute indispensably to the critical semantic mass of
various clusters of scientific hypotheses, and so partake of the empirical
content imbibed from the implied observation categoricals.
As for i napplicable parts of mathematics, say higher set theory, I sym­
pathize with the empiricist in questioning their meaningfulness. We do
keep their sentences as meaningful, but only because they are built of the
same lexicon and grammatical constructions that are needed in applica­
ble mathematics. It would be an intolera bly pedantic tour de force to

Two Dogmas

in

Retrospect

gerrymander our grammar in such a way as to account the inapplicable
flights ungrammatical while preserving the applicable part.
This does put it to us to ponder truth and falsity for the inapplicable
sentences. I n doing so we can get some guidance from a maxim that is al­
ready serving the natural scientist, namely Occam's razor: where choice
is otherwise undetermined, opt for economy. This attitude is in keeping
with my inclination to minimize the cleavage between mathematics and
natural science. That tendency is abetted already by my point about
shared empirical content, and also by my questioning the analytidsyn­
thetic distinction.
What then about the other problem, that of the necessary of mathe­
matical truth ? This again is nicely cleared up by moderate holism, with­
out the help of analyticity. For let us recall that when a cluster of sen­
tences with critical semantic mass is refuted by an experiment, the crisis
can be resolved by revoking one or another sentence of the cluster. We
hope to choose in such a way as to optimize future progress. If one of the
sentences is purely mathematical, we will not choose to revoke it; such a
move would reverberate excessively through the rest of science. We are
restrained by a maxim of minimum mutilation. It is simply in this, I
hold, that the necessity of mathematics lies: our determination to make
revisions elsewhere instead. I make no deeper sense of necessity any­
where. Metaphysical necessity has no place in my naturalistic view of
things, and analyticity hasn't much.
Analyticity undeniably has a place at a common-sense level, and this
has made readers regard my reservations as unreasonable. My thread­
bare bachelor example is one of many undebatable cases. It is intelligible
and often useful in discussion to point out that some disagreement is
purely a matter of words rather than of fact. The point can commonly be
sustained and acted upon by a paraphrase that circumvents a trouble­
some word. Often in talking with a foreigner we recognize some impasse
as due to his having mislearned an English word rather than to his hav­
ing a bizarre view of the subj ect matter. This is a bit of practical psychol­
ogy at which we are all adept.
In Roots of Reference I proposed a rough theoretical definition of
analyticity to fi t these familiar sorts of cases. A sentence is analytic for a
native speaker, I suggested, if he learned the truth of the sentence by
learning the use of one or more of its words. This obviously works for
'No bachelor is married' and the like, and it also works for the basic
laws of logic. Anyone who goes counter to modus ponens, or who af­
firms a conjunction and denies one of its components, is simply flouting

59

60

QUINTESSENCE

what he learned in learning to use 'if' and 'and. ' ( I limit this to native
speakers, because a foreigner can have learned our words indirectly by
translation . )
I also recommended improving this rough definition by providing for
deductive closure, so that truths deducible from analytic ones by analytic
steps would count as analytic i n turn. All logical truths in my narrow
sense-that is, the logic of truth functions, quantification, and identity­
would then perhaps qualify as analytic, in view of Giidel's completeness
proof.
If the logical truths are analytic-hence true by meanings of words­
then what are we to say of revisions, such as imagined in the case of the
law of excluded middle ? Do we thereby change our theory or j ust change
the subject, change the meaning of our words ? This has been a recurrent
challenge, and my answer is that in elementary logic a change of theory
is a change of meaning. Repudiation of the law of excluded middle
would be a change of meaning, and no less a change of theory for that.
You could also have a change of meaning in elementary logic without
change of theory. That would be if the word 'and' were merely put to use
in place of 'or' and vice versa: no change of theory. But in abandoning
the law of excluded middle we would not be preserving the law in any
notation.
For the past five minutes I have been expressing a generous attitude to­
ward analyticity that may seem out of character. In fact my reservations
over analyticity are the same as ever, and they concern the tracing of any
demarcation, even a vague and approximate one, across the domain of
sentences in general. The crude criterion in Roots of R eference, based on
word learning, is no help; we don't in general know how we learned a
word, nor what truths were learned in the process. Nor do we have any
reason to expect uniformity in this regard from speaker to speaker, and
there is no reason to care. Elementary logic an d the bachelor example
are clear enough cases, but there is no going on from there.
It is the wrong kind of question. When in relativity theory momentum
is found to be not quite proportional to velocity, despite its original
definition as mass times velocity, there is no flurry over redefinition or
contradiction in terms, and I don't think there should be. The definition
served its purpose in introducing a word for subsequent use, and the
word was thereafter ours to use in the evolving theory, with no lingering
commitments. Definition is episodic. Mostly in natural science we are
not even favored with definitions, much less bound by them. New terms
are j ust introduced by partial descriptions: electrons, neutrinos, quarks.

In short, I recognize the notion of analyticity in its obvious and useful
but epistemologically insignificant applications. The needs that Camap
felt for the notion in connection with mathematical truth are better met
through holism. Beyond its manifest cases I find analyticity less help than
hindrance. It hegets an uncritical notion of meaning, or synonymy, that
can induce a false sense of understanding. for it is clear that analyticity
and synonymy are interdefinable.
Well, d omestically interdefina ble . Two expressions are synonymous iff
their biconditional or equation is analytic. Bur , should mention that
synonymy and therefore meaning a re even worse off th an analyticity
when we transcend a single language. For if the two expressions to be
equated belong to different languages, their biconditional or equation is
far from analytic; it is incoherent, belonging to no language.
, mentioned my letter of 1 943, where I took issue with Camap both
on anal yticity and on ontological commitment to a bstract obj ects, the
two issues being linked. This same pairing of the two issues recurs i n the
antepenultimate paragraph of "Two Dogma s . " Col map's separation of
questions of existence into questions of fact and questions of frame­
work was a separation of the synthetic and the analytic. Collapse this
epistemol ogical d u ality and you collapse the ontological duality. Sticks,
stones, sets, and numbers all become, for me, denizens of the world on
an equal footing. Va lues of variables.
So also for the contrast noted in the remaining two paragraphs of
"Two Dogma s " : the contrast su pposed by Carnap and C. l . L.ewis be­
tween the factual and the pragmatic. " In repudiating such a boundary, " I
wrote, '" espouse a more thorough pragmatis m . " This passage had un­
foreseen consequences. I suspect it is responsible for my being widely
classified as a pragmatist. I don't obj ect, except that I am not clear on
what it takes to qualify ,,, a pragmatist. I was mere Iv taking the word
from Carnap and handing it back : in whatever sense the framework for
science is pragmatic, so is the rest of science.
Let us now stand o ff, look at the two dogmas, and consider what the
point is in repudiating each of them. Repudiation of the first dogma,
analyticity, is insistence on empirical criteria for semantic concepts: for
svnonymy, meaning. Language is learned and taught by observing and
correcting verbal behavior in observable circumstances. There is nothing
in linguistic meaning that is not thus determined. John Dewey made this
point long ago. What I did, not in "Two Dogmas" but in Word and Oh­
iect, was to press that point for its negative implications regarding the
notion of meaning.

As for the second dogma, reductionism, its repudiation is holism, sec­
onding Duhem. The reductionism that is properly at stake here is moder­
ate reductionism. Extreme reductionism, the n otion that every scientific
sentence should have a full translation i n sense-datum language, is by
now a straw man. Moderate reductionism was the lingering dogma, the
notion that each scientific sentence has its own separate empirical con­
tent. Moderate holism is its denial. Its says that a scientific sentence can­
not in general be expected to imply empirical consequences by itself. A
bigger cluster is usually needed.

Maybe this sparked Joe Ullian's title for the little manual that he and I
coauthored twenty years later: The Web of Belter Clearly my metaphor
needed unpacking, and that was l a rgely m)' concern in the ten years be­
tween "'Two Dogmas " and Word alld Object.
Becoming more consciously and explicitlv n aturalistic, I stiffened up
my flabby reference to 'experience' by turning to our physical interface
with the external world: the physical impacts of rays and molecules
upon our sensory surfaces.
For purposes of a systematic account, I needed to marshal these scat­
tered impacts as unit aggregates of some sort. Exteroceptors offered a
neat solution. I mpacts of ravs and particles are irrelevant except as they
trigger receptors, and happily it is only a question of triggering, with no
question of more or less. So I identified one's input fro m the external
world, o n any given occasion, with one's glo b,d nellral in/JUt on that
occasion: hence with the temporally ordered set of all one's triggered
exteroceptors during that brief moment.
Intricate brain processes, which neurologists are illuminating bit by
bit, intervene between this neural input and perceptio n . Exciting though
that physiological research is, I was able to bypass it for my purposes by
leaping to the resulting relation of {Jercejitual Similarity between glohal
neural inputs. Inputs that arc grossly dissimilar intrinsically�that is, in
respect of what receptors arc triggered�can issue i n similar perceptual
effects after the brain's swift and unconscious work of selecting and cor­
relating. Perceptual similaritv comes in degrees, and admits of a coarse
behavioral criterion in the reinforcement and extincti on of responses.
The grouping of global neural i npnts by this relation of perceptual

Two Dogmas

in

Retro�pect

similarity affords a sufficient theoretical basis, I have argued, for distin­
guishing the sensory modalities and the VMious sensory qualities and
Gestalten. A striking parallel emerges with Carnap's rogischer A lifhall
der Welt, in his derivations from similarities of global experiences.
r should say that in this sketch I am somewhat updating Word and
Ohject in the light of later writings.
The sentences near the periphery o f the fabric-in the metaphor of
"Two Dogma s"-came in Word and Ohject to be called observation
sentences. Their connection with experience was explained as associa­
tion with ranges of perceptually similar neural inputs. Primitively the as­
sociation was by conditioning. Further associations are forged i n the
fullness of time by retroaction from one's developing theory of the
world.
The connections into the fabric, between observation sentences and
theoretical sentences, are forged by shared voca bulary. For the observa­
tion sentences are couched, not in sense-datum la nguage, but directly in
the thing language, as Carnap called it. Thing words are among the
words earliest learned, though learned at first only as one-word observa­
tion sentences or as segments of monolithic observation sentences. 'rhey
are there awaiting gradual reification of their designata and incorpora­
tion into theoretical contexts.
Thanks to this sharing of vocabulary by observation sentences and
theoretical sentences, logical relations hold between them. The pertinent
logical relation, we saw, is logical implication of observation categori­
cals by clusters of theoretical sentences. This is, of course, the merest car­
icature of scientific method. It invites analysis of actual chunks of serious
science, to sec j u st what some of the typical chunks with critical semantic
mass might be, and how the chains of logical implication from them to
observation categoricals might run.
All this still leaves the heuristics of hypothesis untouched: that is, the
technology of framing hypotheses worth testing. This is the domain of
the maxim of minimum mutilation, and of Occam's razor. It is the do­
main also of standard deviation, probable error, and whatever else goes
into sophisticated statistical method.
Deeper insights into the nature of scientific inference and explanation
may some day be gained in neurology, coupled perhaps with computer
simulation, as hinted by the new developments i n so-called connectionist
models; I think of Paul Churchland. 'rhe nature and nurture of science
remains a fertile field of inquiry, varied and inviting.

CARNAP AND L O GI C A L TRUTH

Kant's question "How arc synthetic j u dgments a priori possihle ? " pre­
cipitated the Critique of Pure Reason. Question and answer notwith­
standing, Mill and others persisted in doubting that such j udgments
were possible at all. At length some of Kant's own clearest purported in­
stances, drawn fro m arithmetic, were sweepingly disqualified (or so it
seemed; but see §II) by Frege's reduction of arithmetic to logic. Atten­
tion was thus forced upon the less tendentious and indeed logically prior
question, "How is logical certainty possible ? " I t was largely this lat­
ter question that precipitated the form of empiricism which we associ­
ate with between-war Vienna-a movement which began with Wittgen­
stein's Tractatus and reached its maturity in the work of Carnap.
Mill's position on the second question had been that logic and mathe­
matics were based on empirical generalizations, despite their superficial
appearance to the contrary. This doctrine may well have been felt to do
less than j ustice to the palpable surface differences between the deductive
sciences of logic and mathematics, on the one hand, and the empirical
sciences ordinarily so-called on the other. Worse, the doctrine derogated
from the certainty of logic and mathematics; but Mill may not have been
one to be excessively disturbed by such a consequence. Perhaps classical
mathematics did lie closer to experience then than now; at any rate the
infinitistic reaches of set theory, which are so fraught with speculation
and so remote fro m any possible experience, were unexplored in his day.
And it is against j ust these latter-day mathematical extravagances that
empiricists outside the Vienna Circle have since been known to inveigh, I
1 . See P. \'(1, Bridgman, " /\ PhYSICIst's Second Reaction to Mengenlehre," SCripta

64

Carnap and Logical Truth

in much the spirit in which the empiricists of Vienna and elsewhere have
inveighed against metaphysics.
What now of the empiricist who would grant certainty to logic, and to
the whole of mathematics, and yet would make a clean sweep of other
non-empirical theories under the name of metaphysics ? The Viennese so­
lution of this nice problem was predicated on language. Metaphysics
was meaningless through misuse of language; logic was certain through
tautologous use of language.
As an answer to the question "How is logical certainty possibl e ? " this
linguistic doctrine of logical truth has its attractions. For there can be no
doubt that sheer verbal usage is in general a major determinant of truth.
Even so factual a sentence as 'Brutus killed Caesar' owes its truth not
only to the k i l l i ng but equally to our using the component words as we
do. Why then should a logically true sentence on the same topic, e.g.,
'Brutus killed Caesar or did not kill Caesar,' not be said to owe its truth
/JUreiy to the fact that we use our words (in this case 'or' and ' not' ) as we
d o l -for it depends not at all for its truth upon the killing.
The suggestion is not, of course, that the logically true sentence is a
contingent truth about verbal usage; but rather that it is a sentence
which, given the language, automatically becomes true, whereas 'Brutus
killed Caesar, ' given the language, becomes true only contingently o n the
alleged killing.
further plausibility accrues to the linguistic doctrine of logical truth
when we reflect on the question of alternative logics. Suppose someone
puts forward and uses a consistent logic the principles of which are con­
trary to our own. We arc then clearly free to say that he is merely using
the familiar particles 'and,' 'all,' or whatever, in other than the familiar
senses, and hence that no real contrariety is present after all. There may
of course still be an important failure of intertranslatability, i n that the
behavior of certain of our logical particles is incapable of being dupli­
cated by paraphrases in his system or vice versa. I f the translation in this
sense is possible, from his system into ours, then we are pretty sure to
protest that he was wantonly using the familiar particles 'and' and 'all'
(say) where we might unmisleadingly have used such-and-such other fa­
miliar phrasing. This reflection goes to support the view that the truths
of logic have no content over and a bove the meanings they confer on the
logical voca bulary.
Much the same point can be brought out by a caricature of a doc­
trine of Levy-Bruhl, according to which there arc pre-logical peoples
who accept certain simple self-contradictions as true. Oversimplifying,

65

66

Q U [ [\i T E S S E N C E

n o dou bt, let us suppose it claimed that these natives accept as true a
certain sentence of the form 'p and not p . ' Or-not to oversimplify
too much-that they accept as true a certain heathen sentence of the
form ' q k a bu q ' the English translation of which has the form 'p and not
tJ . ' But now j ust how good a translation is this, and what may the lexi­
cographer's method have bee n ? If any evidence can count against a lex­
icographer's adoption of 'and' and 'not' as translations of ' k a ' and 'bu,'
certainly the natives' acceptance of ' q ka 1m q ' as true counts over­
whelmingly. We arc left with the meaninglessness of the doctrine of there
being pre-logical peoples; pre-logicality is a trait inj ected by bad transla­
tors. ·fhis is one more illustration of the inseparability of the truths of
logic from the meanings of the logical vocabulary.
We thus see that there is something to be said for the naturalness o f the
linguistic doctrine of logical truth. But before we can get much further
we shall have to become more explicit concerning our subject matter.
1I

Without thought of any epistemological doctrine, either the linguistic
doctrine or another, we may mark out the intended scope of the term
'logical truth, ' within that of the broader term 'trnth,' i n the following
way. First we suppose indicated, by enumeration if not otherwise, what
words are to be called logical words; typical ones are 'or,' 'not,' 'if,'
'then,' ' a n d , ' 'all,' 'every,' 'only, ' 'some . ' The logical truths, then, are
those true sentences which involve only logical words essentially. What
this means is that any other words, though they may also occur in a logi­
cal truth (as witness ' Brutus,' 'kill,' and 'Caesar' i n 'Brntus killed or did
not kill Caesa r ' ) , c a n be varied at w i l l without engendering falsity.'
Though formulated with reference to language, the above clarification
2 . Su hstantlally thiS formulation IS traced hack a century and a quarter, hy Bar­
HIllel, to BO\l'ano. Rut note that the formulatIOn fails of Its purpuse unless the phrase
"can be va ned at wtl l , " a hove, IS understood to prOVide for varymg the words not
only srngiy but al�o two or more at a time. For example, the sentence 'If some men
are angeb 'mme 31lllTIals arc angels' can be turned into a falsehood by simultaneous
su bstitutIOn for 'men' and 'angels/ but nut by Jny substitutIOn for 'angels' alone, nor
for 'men,' nor for 'an11nal,,' ( granted the non-existence of angels). ror this observa­

Carnap a n d Logical Truth

docs not of itself h int that logical truths owe their truth to language.
What we have th us far is only a deli mitation o f the class, /)CY accidens if
you please. Afterward the linguistic doctrine o f logical truth, which is a n
epistemological doctrine, goes on to s a y that logical truths a r e t r u e by
virtue purely of the intended mcanings, or intended usage, o f the l ogical
words. O bviously i f logical truths arc true by virtue purely of language,
the logical words are the only part of the language that can be concerned
io the matter; for these are the only ones that occur essentially.
Elementary logic, as commonly systematized nowadays, comprises
truth-function theory, quantification theory, and identity theorv. The
l ogical voca bulary for this part, as commonly rendered for technical pur­
poses, consists o f truth-function signs (corresponding to 'or; 'and,' 'not;
etc . ) , quantifiers a n d their variables, and ' = . '
The further part o f logic i s set theory, which requ i res there to be
classes among the values of its variahles of quantification. The one sign
needed in set theory, beyond those appropriate to elementary logic, is the
connective ' f ' of membership. Additional signs, though commonly used
for convenience, can be eliminated in well-known ways.
I n this dichotomv I leave metathcory, or logical svntax, out of ac­
count. For, either it treats of special objects of a n extralogical kind, viz.,
notational expressions, or else, if these arc made to give way to numbers
by arithmetization, it is reducible via n u mber theory to set theory.
J will not here review the i mportant contrasts between elementary
logic and set theory, except for the following one. Every truth of elemen­
tary logic is obvious ( whatever this really means ) , or can be made so by
some series o f individuallv obvious steps. Set theory, i n its present state
anyway, is otherwise. J a m not alluding here to Giidel's incompleteness
principle, but to something right on the s urface. Set theory was straining
at the leash of in tuition ever since Cantor discovered the higher i n finites;
and with the added impetus of the paradoxes o f set theory the leash was
snapped. Comparative set theory has now long been the trend; for, so far
as is known, no consistent set theory is both adequate to the purposes
envisaged for set theory and capa ble of su bstantiation by steps o f obvi­
ous reasoning from o bviously true principles. What we do is develop one
or anotber set theory by obvious reasoning, or elementary logic, from
unobvious first principles which a rc set down, whether for good or for
the time being, by something very like convention.
Altogether, the contrasts between elementary logic and set theory are
so fundamental that one might well limit the word 'logic' to the former
( though J shal! not), and speak of set theory as mathematics in a sense

67

exclusive of logic. To adopt this course is merely to deprive ' f ' of the sta­
tus of a logical word. Fregc\ derivation of arithmetic would then cease
to count as a derivation from logic; for he used set theory. At any rate we
should be prepared to find that the linguistic doctrine of logical truth
holds for elementary logic and fails for set theory, or vice versa. Kant's
readiness to see logic as analytic and arithmetic as synthetic, in particu­
lar, is not superseded by Frcge's work ( a s Frege suppose d ) ; if 'logic' be
taken as elementary logic. And for Kant logic certainly did not include
set theory.
III

Where someone disagrees with us as to the truth of a sentence, it often
happens that we can convince him by getting the sentence from other
sentences, which he does accept, by a series of steps each of which he ac­
cepts. Disagreement which cannot be thus resolved I shall call deduc­
tively irresoluble. Now if we try to warp the linguistic doctrine of logical
truth around into something like an experimental thesis, perhaps a first
approximation will run thu s : Deductively irresoluble disagreement as to
a logical truth is evidence of deviatIOn in usage (or meanings) 0/ words.
This is not yet experimentally phrased, since one term of the affirmed
relationship, viz., ' usage' (or 'meanings' ) , is in dire need of an indepen­
dent criterion. However, the formulation would seem to be fair enough
within its limits; so let us go ahead with it, not seeking more subtlety un­
til need arises.
Already the obviousness or potential obviousness of elementary logic
can be seen to present an insuperable obstacle to our assigning any ex­
peri mental meaning to the linguistic doctrine of elementary logical truth.
Deductively irresoluble dissent from an elementary logical truth would
count as evidence of deviation over meanings if anything can, but simply
because dissent fro m a logical truism is as extreme as dissent can get.
The philosopher, like the beginner in algebra, works in danger of find­
ing that his solution-in-progress reduces to '0 = 0.' Such is the threat to
the linguistic theory of elementary logical truth. For, that theory now
seems to imply nothing that is not already implied hy the fact that ele­
mentary logic is o bvious or can be resolved into obvious steps.
The considerations which were adduced in §l, to show the naturalness
of the linguistic doctrine, are likewise seen to he empty when scrutinized
3 . See !'rege, roundatl()ns of Anthmetlc, § § 8 7ff. , § 1 09 .

Carnap and Logical Truth

in the present spirit. One was the circumstance that alternative logics are
i nseparable practically fro m mere change in usage of logical words. An­
other was that illogical cultures arc indistinguisbable from ill-tramlated
ones. But both of these circumstances arc adequately accounted for by
mere obviousness of logical principles, without help of a linguistic doc­
trine of logical truth. for, there can be no stronger evidence of a change
in usage than the repudiation of what had been ohvious, and no stronger
evidence of bad translation than that it translates earnest affirm,H ions
into obvious falsehoods.
Another point in §I was that true sentences generally depend for their
truth on the traits of their language in addition to the traits of their s u b ­
j ect matter; and t h a t logical truths t h e n fit neatly in as t h e limiting case
where the dependence on traits of the su bj ect matter is nil. Consider,
however, the logical truth 'Everything is self-identical,' or ' ( x ) ( x = x ) . '
We call s a y that it depends for i t s truth on traits of the language ( spe­
cifically on the usage of '= ' ) , and not on traits of its subject matter; but
we can also say, alternatively, that it depends on an obvious trait, viz.,
self-identity, of its subj ect matter, viz., everything. The tendency of o u r
present reflections is t h a t there is no difference.
I have been using the vaguely psychological word " o bvious " 11on­
technically, assigning it no explanatory value. My suggestion is merely
that the linguistic doctrine of elementary logical truth likewise leav"Cs ex­
planation un begun. I do not suggest that the linguistic doctrine is false
and some doctrine of u ltimate and inexplica ble insight into the obvious
traits of reality is true, but only that there is no real di fference between
these two pseudo-doctrines.
Turning away now from elementary logic, let us see how the linguistic
doctrine of logical truth fares in application to set theory. As noted in
§ IT, we may think of ' E ' as the one sign for set theory in addition to those
of elementary logic. Accordingly the version of the linguistic doctrine
which was italicized at the beginning of the present section becomes, in
application to set theory, this: Among persons who are already in agree­
ment on elementary logic, any deductively irresoluble disagreement as to
a truth of set theory is evidence of deviation in usage (or meaning) of ' f". '
This thesis is not trivial in quite the way in which the parallel thesis for
elementary logic was seen to be. It is not indeed experimenta lly sig­
nificant as it stands, simply because of the lack, noted earlier, of a sepa­
rate criterion for usage or meaning. But it does seem reasonable, hy the
following reasoning.
Any acceptable evidence of usage or meaning of words must reside

69

70

Q U I N T E S S E 1': C E

surely either in the ohservable circumstances under which the words are
uttered ( i n the case of concrete terms referring to o hservable individuals)
or in the affirmation and denial of sentences in which the words occur.
Only the second alternative is relevant to ' f . ' Therefore any evidence of
deviation i n usage or meaning of ' E ' must reside in disagreement on sen­
tences containing ' f . ' This is not, of course, to say of every sentence con­
taining ' E' that disagreement over it establishes deviation in usage or
meaning of 'f.' We have to assume in the first place that the speaker
under investigation agrees with us on the meanings o f words other than
' E' in the sentences in question. And it might well be that, even from
among the sentences containing only ' E ' and words on whose meanings
he agrees with us, there is only a select species S which is so fundamental
that he cannot dissent from them without hetraying deviation in his us­
age o r meaning of ' E. ' But S may be expected surely to include some ( i f
not a l l ) of t h e sentences which contain nothing b u r ' E' and t h e elemen­
tary logical particles; for it is these sentences, insofar as true, that consti­
tute ( pure, or unapplied ) set theory. But it is difficult to conceive of how
to be other than democratic toward the truths of set theory. I n exposi­
tion we may select some of these truths as so-called postulates and de­
duce others from them, bur this is subj ective discrimination, variable at
will, expository and not set-theoretic. We do not change our meaning of
' E ' between the page where we show that one particular truth is deduc­
i ble by elementary logic from another and the page where we show the
converse. Given this democratic outlook, finally, the law of sufficient
reason leads us to look upon S as including all the sentences which con­
tain only ' E ' and the elementary logical particles. It then follows that
anyone in agreement on elementary logic and in irresoluble disagree­
ment on set theory is in deviation with respect to the usage or meaning of
' f ' ; and this was the thesis.
The effect of our effort to inj ect content into the linguistic doctrine of
logical truth has been, up to now, to suggest that the doctrine says noth­
ing worth saying about elementary logical truth, bur that when applied
to set-theoretic truth it makes for a reasonable partial condensation of
the otherwise vaporous notion of meaning as applied to ' f . '
IV

The linguistic doctrine of logical truth is sometimes expressed by saying
that such truths are true by linguistic convention. Now if this be so, cer-

Catnap and Logical Truth

tainly the conventions are not in general explicit. Relatively few persons,
before the time of Carnap, had ever seen any convention that engen­
dered truths o f elementary logic. Nor can this circumstance be ascribed
merely to the slipshod ways of our predecessors . For it is impossible in
principle, even in an ideal state, to get even the most elementary part of
logic exclusively by the explicit application of conventions stated in ad­
vance. The difficulty is the vicious regress, familiar from Lewis Carroll,
which I have elaborated elsewhere .4 Briefly the point is that the logical
truths, being infinite in number, must be given by general conventions
rather than singly; and logic is needed then to begin with, in the meta­
theory, in order to apply the general conventions to individual cases.
" In dropping the attributes of deli berateness and explicitness from the
notion of linguistic convention," I went on to complain in the a foremen­
tioned paper, " we risk depriving the latter of any explanatory force and
reducing it to an idle label. " It would seem that to call elementary logic
true by convention is to add nothing but a metaphor to the linguistic
doctrine of logical truth which, as applied to elementary logic, has itself
come to seem rather an empty figure ( d. § I I I ) .
T h e case of s e t theory, however, is different on both counts. F o r set
theory the linguistic doctrine has seemed less empty (d. § II I ) ; in set the­
ory, moreover, convention in quite the ordinary sense seems to be pretty
much what goes on ( d. § II ) . Conventionalism has a serious claim to at­
tention in the philosophy of mathematics, if only because of set theory.
Historical ly, though conventionalism was encouraged in the philosophy
of mathematics rather by the non-Euclidean geometries and a bstract al­
gebras, with little good reason. We can contribute to subsequent pur­
poses by surveying this situation. Further talk of set theory is deferred
to § V.
In the beginning there was Euclidean geometry, a compendium of
truths about form and void; and its truths were not based on convention
( except as a conventionalist might, begging the present question, apply
this tag to everything mathematica l ) . Its truths were in practice pre­
sented by deduction from so-called postulates ( including axioms; I shall
not distinguish) ; and the selection o f truths for this role o f postulate, out
of the totality of truths of Euclidean geometry, was indeed a matter of
convention. But this is not truth by convention. The truths were there,
and what was conventional was merely the separation of them into those

to be taken as staring point ( for purposes of the exposition at hand) and
those to be deduced from them.
The non-Euclidean geometries came of artificial deviations from Eu­
clid's postulates, without thought (to begin with) of true i nterpretation.
These departures were doubly conventional; for Euclid's postulates were
a conventional selection from among the truths of geometry, and then
the departures were arbitrarily or conventionally devised in turn. But
still there was no truth by convention, because there was no truth.
Playing within a non-Euclidean geometry, one might conveniently
make believe that his theorems were interpreted and true; but even such
conventional make-believe is not truth by convention. For it is not really
truth at all; and what is conventionally pretended is that the theorems
are true by non-convention.
Non-Euclidean geometries have, in the fullness of time, received seri­
ous i nterpretations. This means that ways have been found of so con­
struing the hitherto unconstrued terms as to identify the at first con­
ventionally chosen set of non-sentences with some genuine truths, and
truths presumably not by convention. The status of an interpreted non­
Euclidean geometry differs in no basic way from the original status of
Euclidean geometry, noted above.
Uninterpreted systems became quite the fashion after the advent
of non·Euclidean geometries. This fashion helped to cause, and was in
turn encouraged by, an increasingly formal approach to mathematics.
Methods had to become more formal to make up for the unavailabil­
ity, in un interpreted systems, of intuition. Conversely, disinterpretation
served as a crude but useful device ( until Frege's syntactical approach
came to be appreciated) for achieving formal rigor uncorrupted by intu­
ition.
The tendency to look upon non-Euclidean geometries as true by con­
vention applied to uninterpreted systems generally, and then carried over
from these to mathematical systems generally. A tendency indeed devel­
oped to look upon all mathematical systems as, qua mathematical, un­
interpreted. This tendency can be accounted for by the increase of for­
mality, together with the use of disinterpretation as a heuristic aid to
formalization. Finally, in a n effort to make some sense of mathematics
thus drained of all interpretation, recourse was had to the shocking
quibble o f identifying mathematics merely with the elementary logic
which leads from uninterpreted postulates to un interpreted theorems. \
5. See § I of the precedmg essay [ Chapter I ] .

What is shocking about this is that it puts arithmetic qua interpreted the­
ory of n u m ber, and analysis qua interpreted theory of functions, and ge­
ometry qua i nterpreted theory of space, outside mathematics altogether.
The substantive reduction of mathematics to logic by Frege, White­
head, and Russell is of course quite a n other thing. It is a reduction not to
elementary logic but to set theory; and it is a reduction of genuine inter­
preted mathematics, from arithmetic onward.
v

Let us then put aside these confusions and get back to set theory. Set the­
ory is pursued as interpreted mathematics, like a rithmetic and a nalysis;
indeed, it is to set theory that those further branches are reducible. I n set
theory we discourse about certain immaterial entities, real or errone­
ously alleged, viz., sets, or clas&es. And it is i n the effort to make up our
minds about genuine truth and falsity of sentences about these obj ects
that we find ourselves engaged in something very like convention in an
ordinary non-metaphorical sense of the word. We find ourselves making
deliberate choices and setting them forth unaccompanied by any attempt
at j ustification other than i n terms of elegance and convenience. These
adoptions, called postulates, and their logical consequences ( via elemen­
tary logic) , are true until further notice.
So here is a case where postulation can plausibly be looked on as
constituting truth by convention. But in § IV we have seen how the phi­
losophy of mathematics can be corrupted by supposing that postulates
always play that role. Insofar as we would epistemologize and not j ust
mathematize, we might divide postulation as follows. Uninterpreted
postulates may be put aside, as no l onger concerning us; and on the i n ­
terpreted s i d e w e m a y distinguish between legislative and discursive
postulation. Legislative postulation institutes truth by convention, and
seems plausibly illustrated in contemporary set theory. On the other
hand discursive postulation is mere selection, from a pre-existing body
of truths, of certai n ones for use as a basis from which to derive others,
initially known or u n known. What discursive postulation fixes is not
truth, but only some pa rticular ordering of the truths, for purposes per­
haps of pedagogy or perhaps of inquiry into l ogical relationships ( logical
i n the sense of elementary logic ) . A l l postulation is of course conven­
tional, but only legislative postulation properly hints of truth by conven­
tion.
It is well to recognize, if only for its distinctness, yet a further way

73

74

QUINTESSENCE

i n which convention can enter; viz., in the adoption of new notations
for old ones, without, as one tends to say, change of theory. Truths con­
taining the new notation are conventional transcriptions of sentences
true apart from the convention in question. They depend for their truth
partly on language, but then so did 'Brutus killed Caesar' (d. § I ) . They
come into being through the conventional adoption of a new sign, and
they become true through conventional definition of that sign together
with whatever made the corresponding sentences in the old notation
true.
Definition, in a properly narrow sense of the word, is convention in a
properly narrow sense of the word. But the phrase 'true by definition'
must be taken cautiously; in its strictest usage it refers to a transcription,
by the definition, of a truth of elementary logic. Whether such a sentence
is true by convention depends o n whether the logical truths themselves
he reckoned as true by convention. Even an outright equation or bicon­
ditional connection of the definiens and the definiendum is a definitional
transcription of a prior logical truth of the form 'x = x' or 'p == p . '
Definition commonly so-called is not thus narrowly conceived, and
must for present purposes be divided, as postulation was divided, into
legislative and discursive. Legislative definition introduces a notation
hitherto unused, or used only at variance with the practice proposed, or
used also at variance, so that a convention is wanted to settle the ambi­
guity. Discursive definition, on the other hand, sets forth a pre-existing
relation of interchangeability or coextensiveness between notations in
already familiar usage. A frequent purpose of this activity is to show
how some chosen part of language can be made to serve the purposes of
a wider part. Another frequent purpose is language instruction.
It is only legislative definition, and not discursive definition or discur­
sive postulation, that makes a conventional contribution to the truth of
sentences. Legislative postulation, finally, affords truth by convention
unalloyed.
Increasingly the word 'definition' connotes the formulas of definition
which appear i n connection with formal systems, signaled by some ex­
tra-systematic sign such as ' = d/. ' Such definitions are best looked upon as
correlating two systems, two n otations, one of which is prized for its
economical lexicon and the other for its brevity or familiarity of expres­
sion.6 Definitions so used can be either legislative or discursive in their
6 . See From a LogIcal Pomt of V,ew, pp. 26-27 [Cha pter 2 J .

Carnap and Logical Truth

inception. But this distinction is in practice left unindicated, and wisely;
for it is a distinction only between particular acts of definition, and not
germane to the definition as an enduring channel of inter-translation.
The distinction between the legislative and the discursive refers thus to
the act, and not to its enduring consequence, in the case of postulation as
in the case of definition. This is because we are taking the notion of truth
by convention fairly literally and simple-mindedly, for lack of an intelli­
gible alternative. So conceived, conventionality is a passing trait, sig­
nificant at the moving front of science but useless in classifying the sen­
tences behind the lines. It is a trait of events and not of sentences.
Might we not still proj ect a derivative trait upon the sentences them­
selves, thus speaking of a sentence as forever true by convention if its
first adoption as true was a convention ? No; this, if done seriously,
involves us in the most unrewarding historical conjecture. Legislative
postulation contributes truths which become integral to the corpus of
truths; the artificiality of their origin does not linger as a localized qual­
ity, but suffuses the corpus. If a subsequent expositor singles out those
once legislatively postulated truths again as postulates, this signifies
nothing; he is engaged o nly in discursive postulation. He could as well
choose his postulates fro m elsewhere in the corpus, and will if he thinks
this serves his expository ends.
VI

Set theory, currently so caught up in legislative postulation, may some
day gain a norm-even a strain of obviousness, perhaps-and lose all
trace of the conventions in its history. A day could likewise have been
when our elementary logic was itself instituted as a deli berately conven­
tional deviation from something earlier, instead of evolving, as it did,
mainly by unplanned shifts of form and emphasis coupled with casual
novelties of notation.
Today indeed there a re dissident logicians even at the elementary level,
propounding deviations from the law of the excluded middle. These de­
viations, insofar as meant for serious use and not j ust as uninterpreted
systems, are as clear cases of legislative postulation as the ones in set the­
ory. For here we have again, quite as in set theory, the propounding of a
deliberate choice unaccompanied (conceivably) by an attempt at j us­
tification other than in terms of convenience.
This example fro m elementary logic controverts no conclusion we

75

76

QUINTESSENCE

have reached. According to § § I and III, the departure from the law of the
excluded middle would count as evidence of revised usage of 'or' and
'not.' (This j udgment was upheld i n § III, though disqualified as evidence
for the linguistic doctrine of logical truth. ) For the deviating logician the
words 'or' and ' n ot' are unfamiliar, or defamiliarized; and his decisions
regarding truth values for their proposed contexts can then be j ust as
genuinely a matter of deliberate convention as the decisions of the cre­
ative set theorist regarding contexts of ' E . '
The two cases are indeed much alike. Not only is departure fro m the
classical logic of 'or' and 'not' evidence of revised usage of 'or' and 'not';
likewise, as argued at length in § III, divergences between set theorists
may reasonably be reckoned to revised usage of ' E. ' Any such revised us­
age is conspicuously a matter of convention, and can be declared by leg­
islative postulation.
We have been at a loss to give substance to the linguistic doctrine, par­
ticularly of elementary logical truth, or to the doctrine that the familiar
truths of logic are true by conventi o n. We have found some sense i n the
notion of truth by convention, but only as attaching to a process of
adoption, viz., legislative postulation, and not as a significant lingering
trait of the legislatively postulated sentence. Surveying current events,
we note legislative postulation i n set theory and, at a more elementary
level, i n connection with the law of the excluded middle.
And do we not find the same continually i n the theoretical hypotheses
of natural science itself? What seemed to smack of convention in set the­
ory ( § V ) , at any rate, was " deliberate choice, set forth unaccompanied
by any attempt at j ustificati o n other than i n terms of elegance and conve­
nience " ; and to what theoretical hypothesis of natural science might not
this same character be attributed? For surely the j ustification of a ny the­
oretical hypothesis can, at the time of hypothesis, consist i n n o more
than the elegance or convenience which the hypothesis brings to the con­
taining body of laws and data. How then are we to delimit the category
of legislative postulation, short of including under it every new act of sci­
entific hypothesis ?
The situation may seem to be saved, for ordinary hypotheses in natu­
ral science, by there being some indirect but eventual confrontation with
empirical data . However, this confrontation can be remote; and, con­
versely, some such remote confrontation with experience may be claimed
even for pure mathematics and elementary logic. The semblance of a dif­
ference in this respect is largely due to overemphasis of departmental

Canup and Logical Truth

boundaries. For a self-contained theory which we can check with experi­
ence includes, in point of fact, not only its various theoretical hypotheses
of so-called natural science hut also such portions of logic and mathe­
matics as it makes use of. Hence I do not see how a line is to he drawn
hetween hypotheses which confer truth by convention and hypotheses
which do not, short of reckoning all hypotheses to the former category
save perhaps those actually derivable or refutable by elementary logic
from what Carnap used to call protocol sentences. But this version, be­
sides depending to an unwelcome degree on the debatable notion of pro­
tocol sentences, is far too inclusive to suit anyone.
Evidently our tahles are waxing. We had heen trying to make sense of
the role of convention in a priori k nowledge. Now the very distinction
between a priori and empirical hegins to waver and dissolve, at least as a
distinction hetween sentences. (It could of course still hold as a distinc­
tion between factors in one's adoption of a sentence, but both factors
might be operative everywhere . )
Vll

Whatever our difficulties over the relevant distinctions, it must be con­
ceded that logic and mathematics do seem qual itatively different from
the rest of science. Logic and mathematics hold conspicuously aloof
fro m any express appeal, certainly, to observation and experiment. Hav­
ing thus nothing external to look to, logicians and mathematicians look
closely to notation and explicit notational operations: to expressions,
terms, suhstitution, transposition, cancellation, clearing of fractions,
and the like. This concern of logicians and mathematicians with syntax
(as Carnap calls it) is perennial, but in modern times it has become in­
creasingly searching and explicit, and has even prompted, as we see, a
linguistic philosophy of logical and mathematical truth .
On the other hand an effect of these same formal developments in
modern logic, curiously, has heen to show how to divorce mathemat­
ics ( other than elementary logic) from any peculiarly notational consid­
erations not equally relevant to natural science. By this I mean that
mathematics can he handled ( insofar as it can be h a ndled at all) by
axiomatization, outwardly quite like any system of hypotheses else­
where in science; and elementary logic can then be left to extract the the­
orems.
The consequent affinity hetween mathematics and systematized natu-

77

78

Q U ] l': T E S S E N C E

ral science was recognized by Carnap when he propounded his P-rules
al ongside his L-rules or meaning postulates. Yet he did not look upon
the P-rules as engendering analytic sentences, sentences true purely by
language. How to sustain this distinction has been very much our prob­
lem in these pages, and one on which we have found little encourage­
ment.
Carnap appreciated this problem, in Logical Syntax, as a problem of
finding a difference in kind between the P-rules (or the truths thereby
specified ) and the L-rules (or the L-truths, analytic sentences, thereby
specifie d ) . Moreover he proposed an i ngenious solution.' In effect he
characterized the logical ( including mathematical ) vocabulary as the
largest vocabulary such that ( 1 ) there are sentences which contain only
that voca bulary and (2) all such sentences are determinable as true or
false by a purely syntactical condition-i.e., by a condition which speaks
only of concatenation of marks. Then he limited the L-truths in effect to
those involving just the logical vocabulary essentially.'
Truths given by P-rules were supposedly excluded from the category
of logical truth under this criterion, because, though the rules specifying
them are formally stated, the vocabulary involved can also be recom­
bined to give sentences whose truth values are not determinate under
any set of rules formally formulable in advance.
At this point one can obj ect ( pending a further expedient of Carnap's,
which I shall next explai n ) that the criterion based on ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) fails of
its purpose. For, consider to begin with the totality of those sentences
which a re expressed purely within what Carnap (or anyone) would want
to count as logical (and mathematical ) vocabulary. Suppose, in confor­
mity with ( 2 ) , that the division of this totality into the true and the false
is reproducible i n purely syntactical terms. Now surely the adding of one
general term of an extra-logical kind, say 'heavier than,' is not going to
alter the situation. The truths which are expressible i n terms of j ust
'heavier than ,' together with the logical vocabulary, will be truths of only
the most general kind, such as ' ( 3x ) ( 3y ) (x is heavier than y),' '(x)
(x is
heavier than x ) , ' and ' ( x ) ( y ) ( z ) ( x is heavier t h a n y . y is heavier t h a n z . :l .
x is heavier t h a n z ) . ' T h e division of t h e truths fro m t h e falsehoods in
this supplementary domain can probably be reproduced i n syntactical

terms if the division of the original totality could. But then, under the cri­
terion based o n ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , 'heavier than' qualifies for the logical vocab­
ulary. And it is hard to see what whole collection of general terms of nat­
ural science might not qualify likewise.
The further expedient, by which Carnap met this difficulty, was his use
of Cartesian co-ordinates.' Under this procedure, each spatio-temporal
particular c becomes associated with a class K of quadruples of real
numbers, viz., the class of those quadruples which are the co-ordinates
of component point events o f c. Further let us write K[t] for the class of
triples which with t appended belong to K; thus K[t] is that class of tri­
ples of real numbers which is associated with the momentary state of ob­
j ect c at time t. Then, in order to say, e.g., that c , is heavier than c, at time
t, we say 'H(KI [ t ] , K,[tJ ) , ' which might be translated as 'The momentary
object associated with K , [t] is heavier than that associated with K2[t] . '
N o w K I [t] a n d K, [tj are, i n every particular case, purely mathematical
obj ects; viz., classes of triples of real numbers. So let us consider all the
true and false sentences of the form ' H ( K I [t], K, [ tj ) ' where, in place of
'K I [t] ' and ' K, [ t] , ' we have purely logico-mathematical designations of
particular classes of triples of real numbers. There is no reason to sup­
pose that all the truths of this domain can be exactly segregated in purely
syntactical terms. Thus inclusion of 'H' does violate ( 2 ) , and therefore
'H' fails to qualify as logical vocabulary. By adhering to the method
o f co-ordinates and thus reconstruing all predicates of natural science
in the manner here ill ustrated by 'H, ' Carnap overcomes the obj ection
noted in the preceding paragraph.
To sum up very roughly, this theory characterizes logic (and mathe­
matics ) as the largest part of science within which the true-false dichot­
omy can be reproduced in syntactical terms. This version may seem
rather thinner than the claim that logic and mathematics are somehow
true by linguistic convention, but at any rate it is more intelligible, and, if
true, perhaps i nteresting and important. To become sure of its truth, in­
terest, and importance, however, we must look more closely at this term
'syntax.'
As used in the passage: "The terms 'sentence' and 'direct consequence'
are the two primitive terms of logical synta x ," 10 the term 'syntax' is of
course irrelevant to a thesis. The relevant sense is that rather in which it

connotes discourse about marks and their succession. But here still we
must distinguish degrees of inclusiveness; two different degrees are ex­
emplified in Logical Syntax, according as the object language is Carnap's
highly restricted Language [ or his more powerful Language II. For the
former, Carnap's formulation of logical truth is n a rrowly syntactica l in
the manner of familiar formalizations of logical systems by axioms and
rules of inference . But Giidel's proof of the incompletability of elemen­
tary number theory shows that no such approach can be adequate to
mathematics in general, nor in particular to set theory, nor to Language
II. for Language n, in consequence, Carnap's formulation of logical truth
proceeded along the lines rather of Tarski's technique of truth defini­
tion . 1 1 The result was still a purely syntactical specification of the logical
truths, but only in this more liberal sense of 'syntactical ' : it w a s couched
i n a vocabulary consisting (in effect) of (a) names of signs, (b) an opera­
tor expressing concatenation of expressions, and ( c ) , hy way of auxiliary
machinery, the whole logical (a n d mathematical) vocabulary itself.
So construed, however, the thesis that logico-mathematical truth is
syntactically specifiable becomes uninteresting. For, what it says is that
logico-mathematical truth is specifiable in a notation consisting solely of
( a ) , ( b ) , and the whole logico-mathematical vocabulary itself. But this
thesis would hold equally if 'Iogico-mathematical' were broadened (at
both places in the thesis ) to include physics, economics, and anything
else under the sun; Tarski's routine of truth definition would still carry
through j ust as well. No special trait of logic and mathematics has been
singled out after all.
Strictly speaking, the position is weaker still. The mathematics ap­
pealed to i n (c) must, as Tarski shows, be a yet more inclusive mathemat­
ical theory in certain respects than that for which truth is being defined.
It was largely hecause of his increasing concern over this self-stultify i ng

situation that Carnap relaxed his stress on syntax, in the years following
L ogical Syntax, in favor of semantics.

Even if logical truth were specifiable in syntactical terms, this would not
show that it was grounded in language. Any finite class of truths ( to take
an extreme example) is clearly reproducible by a membership condition
couched in as narrowly syntactical terms as you please; yet we certainly
cannot say of every finite class of truths that its members are true purely
by language. Thus the ill-starred doctrine of syntactical specifiability of
logical truth was always something other than the linguistic doctrine of
logical truth, if this be conceived as the doctrine that logical truth is
grounded in language. In any event the doctrine of syntactical specifia­
bility, which we found pleasure in being able to make comparatively
clear sense of, has unhappily had to go by the board. The linguistic doc­
trine of logical truth, on the other hand, goes sturdily on.
The notion of logical truth is now counted by Carnap as semantica! '
This of course does not of itself m e a n that logical truth is grounded in
language; for note that the general notion of truth is also semantical,
though truth in general is not grounded purely in language. But the se­
mantical attribute of logical truth, in particular, is one which, according
to Carnap, is grounded i n language: in convention, fiat, meaning. Such
support as he hints for this doctrine, aside fro m ground covered in § § I­
VI, seems to depend on an analogy with what goes on in the propound­
ing of artificial languages; and I shall now try to show why I think the
analogy mistaken.
I may best schematize the point by considering a case, not di rectly
concerned with logical truth, where one might typically produce an arti­
ficial language as a step in an argument. This is the imaginary case of a
logical positivist, say Ixmann, who is out to defend scientists against the
demands of a metaphysician. The metaphysician argues that science pre­
supposes metaphysical principles, or raises metaphysical problems, and
that the scientists should therefore show due conce rn . Ixman n 's a nswer
consists in showing in detail how people (on Mars, say) might speak a
language quite adequate to all of our science but, unlike our language,
incapable of expressing the alleged metaphysical issues. (I applaud this
answer, and think it embodies the most telling component of Carnap's
own anti-metaphysical representations; but here I digress. ) Now how

81

82

QUINTESSENCE

does our hypothetical Ixmann specify that doubly hypothetical lan­
guage ? By telling us, at least to the extent needed for his argument, what
these Martians are to be imagined as uttering and what they are thereby
to be understood to mean. Here is Carnap's familiar duality of forma­
tion rules and transformation rules ( o r meaning postulates ) , as rules of
language. But these rules are part only of Ixmann's narrative machinery,
not part of what he is portraying. He is not representing his hypothetical
Martians themselves as somehow explicit o n formation and transforma­
tion rules. Nor is he representing there to be any intrinsic difference be­
tween those truths which happen to be disclosed to us by his partial
specifications ( his transformation rules) and those further truths, hypo­
thetically likewise known to the Martians of his parable, which he did
not trouble to sketch in.
The threat of fallacy lurks in the fact that Ixmann's rules are indeed ar­
bitrary fiats, as is his whole Martian para ble. The fallacy consists in con­
fusing levels, projecting the conventional character of the rules into the
story, and so misconstruing Ixmann's parable as attributing truth legisla­
tion to his hypothetical Martians.
The case of a non-hypothetical artificial language is in principle the
same. Being a new invention, the language has to be explained; and the
explanation will proceed by what may certainly be called formation and
transformation rules. These rules will hold by arbitrary fiat, the artifex
being boss. But all we can reasona bly ask of these rules is that they en­
able us to find corresponding to each of his sentences a sentence of like
truth value in familiar ordinary language. There is no ( to me) intelligible
additional decree that we can demand of him as to the boundary be­
tween analytic and synthetic, logic and fact, among his truths. We may
well decide to extend our word 'analytic' or 'logically true' to sentences
of his language which he in his explanations has paired off fairly directly
with English sentences so classified by us; but this is our decree, regard­
ing our word 'analytic' or 'logically true. '

We had in § I I t o form s o m e rough idea of what logical truth w a s sup­

logical truth. This we did, with help of the general notion of truth 1 2 to12. I n defense of thiS general notIon, i n invidiOUS contrast to that of analyticity,

gether with a partial enumeration of the logical vocabulary of a particu­
lar l anguage. In § VII we found hope of a less provincial and accidental
characterization of logical vocabulary; but it fa iled. Still, the position is
not intolerable We well know from modern logic how to devise a techni­
cal notation which is admirably suited to the business of 'or,' 'not,' 'and,'
'all,' 'only,' and such other particles as we would care to count as logical;
and to enumerate the signs and constructions of that technical notation,
or a theoretically adequate subset of them, is the work of a moment (cf.
§ I I ) . Insofar as we are content to think of all science as fitted within that
stereotyped logical framework-and there is no hardship in so doing­
our notion of logical vocabulary is precise. And so, derivatively, is our
notion of logical truth. But only in point of extent. There is no epis­
temological corollary as to the ground of logical truth ( cf. § I I ) .
Even this halfway tolerable situation o btains o n l y for logical truth in a
relatively narrow sense, omitting truths by "essential predication" (Aris­
totle) such as 'No bachelor is married.' I tend to reserve the term 'logi­
cally true' for the narrower domain, and to usc the term 'analytic' for the
more inclusive domain which includes truths by essential predication.
Carnap on the contrary has used both terms in the broader sense. But the
problems of the two subdivisions of the analytic class differ in such a
way that it has been convenient up to now in this essay to treat mainly of
logical truth in the narrower sense .
The truths by essential predication are sentences which can be turned
into logical truths by supplanting certain simple predicates ( e . g . , ' b ache­
lor') by complex synonyms ( e . g . , 'man not married ' ) . This formulation is
not inadequate to such further examples as 'If A is part of B and B is part
of C then !l is part of C; this case can be managed by using for 'is part
of' the synonym 'overlaps nothing save what overlaps. ' ' ' The relevant
notion of synonvmy is simply analytic co-extensiveness ( however circu­
lar this might be as a definiti o n ) .
To count analyticity a genus of logical truth is to grant, it m a y seem,
the linguistic doctrine of logical truth; for the term 'analytic' directly
suggests truth hy language. But this suggestio n can he adj usted, in paral­
lel to what was said of 'true by definition' in § V. 'Analytic' means true hy
synonymy and logic, hence no doubt true by language and logic, a n d
simply t r u e by language it' the linguistic doctrine of logical truth is right.
Logic itself, throughout these remarks, may be taken as including or ex1 3 . After Nelson (;ooJ.man, The Structure of ApfJearance (Cambndge, M,lSS . :

eluding set theory (and hence mathematics ) , depending on further details
of one's position.
What has made it so difficult for us to make satisfactory sense of the
linguistic doctrine is the obscurity of 'true by language . ' Now 'synony­
mous' lies within that same central obscurity; for, about the best we can
say of synonymous predicates is that they are somehow " co-extensive by
language. " The o bscurity extends, of course, to 'analytic. '
O n e quickly identifies certain seemingly transparent cases of synon­
ymy, such as 'bachelor' and 'man not married,' and senses the triviality
of associated sentences such as 'No bachelor is married: Conceivably
the mechanism of such recognition, when better understood, might be
made the basis of a definition of synonymy and analyticity in terms of
linguistic behavior. O n the other hand such an approach might make
sense only of something like degrees of synonymy and analyticity. r see
no reason to expect that the full-width analyticity which Carnap and
others make such heavy demands upon can be fitted to such a founda­
tion in even an approximate way. I n any event, we at present lack any
tenable general suggestion, either rough and practical or remotely theo­
retical, as to what it is to be an analytic sentence. All we have are pur­
ported illustrations, and claims that the truths of elementary logic, with
or without the rest of mathematics, should be counted in. Wherever
there has been a semblance of a general criterion, to my knowledge,
there has been either some drastic failure such as tended to admit all or
no sentences as analytic, or there has been a circularity of the kind noted
three paragraphs back, or there has been a dependence on terms like
'meaning,' 'possible,' 'conceivable,' and the like, which are at least as
mysterious ( and in the same way) as what we want to define. r have ex­
patiated on these troubles elsewhere , ' 4 as has White .
Logical truth ( i n my sense, excluding the additional category of essen­
tial predication) is, we saw, well enough definable ( relatively to a fixed
logical notation ) . Elementary logical truth can even be given a narrowly
syntactical formulation, such as Carnap once envisaged for logic and
mathematics as a whole ( d. § VTI) ; for the deductive system of elemen­
tary logic is known to be complete. But when we would supplement the
logical truths by the rest of the so-called analytic truths, true by essential
predication, then we arc no longer able even to say what we are talking
about. The distinction itself, and not merely an epistemological question
concerning it, is what is then in question.

What of settling the limits of the hroad class of analytic truths by
fixing on a standard language as we did for l ogica l truth ? No, the matter
is vcry different. Once given the logical vocabulary, we have a means of
clearlv marking off the species logical truth within the genus truth. But
the intermediate genus analvticity is not pa rallel, for i t does not comist
of the truths which contain j ust a certain vocabulary essentially ( i n t h e
s e n s e of § I I \ . To segregate analyticity we should need rather s o m e sort o f
accounting of synonymies throughout a universal or all-purpose lan­
guage. No regimented universal language is at hand, however, for con­
sideration; what Carnap has propounded in this direction have of course
heen only i l lustrative samples, fragmentary in scope. And even if there
were one, it is not clear by what standards we would care to settle ques­
tions of synonymy and analyticity within it.
x

Carnap's present position 1 \ is that one has specified a language quite rig­
orously only when he has fixed, by dint of so-called meaning postulates,
what sentences arc to count as a nalytic. ·fhe proponent is supposed to
distinguish between those of his declarations which count as meaning
postulates, and thus engender analyticity, and those which do not. ·fhis
he does, presumably, by attach ing the l a bel 'mcaning postulate . '
B u t the sense of this l a bel i s fa r less clear t o m e than four causes of its
seeming to be clear. Which of these causes has worked on Carnap, i f anv,
I cannot say; but r have no doubt that all four have worked on his read­
ers. One of these causes is misevaluation of the role of convention in
connection with artificial bnguage; thus note the unattributed fa llacy
described in § VIJI. Another is misevaluation of the conventiona l ity of
postulates: fa ilure to appreciate that postu lates, though they are postu­
lates always by fiat, are not therefore true by fiat ( d. § § JV-V ) . A third is
over-estimation of the distinctive n ature of postulates, and of definitions,
because o f conspicuous and peculiar roles which postulates and defini­
tions have played in situations not really relevant to present concerns:
postulates in uninterpreted systems ( d. § IV ) , and definitions in double
systems of notation (d. § V ) . A fourth is misevaluation of legislative pos­
tulation and legislative definition themselves, in two respects: failure to
appreciate that this legislative trait is a trait of scientific hypotheses very

generally ( d. §VI), and failure to appreciate that it is a trait o f the pass­
ing event rather than of the truth which is thereby instituted ( cf. end
of § V ) .
Suppose a scientist introduces a n e w term, for a certain substance o r
force . He introduces it hy an a c t either of legislative definition or of legis­
lative postulation. Progressing, he evolves hypotheses regarding further
traits of the named substance or force. Suppose now that some such
eventual hypothesis, well attested, identifies this su bstance or force with
one named by a complex term built up of other portions of his scientific
vocabulary. We all know that this new identity will figure in the ensuing
developments quite on a par with the identitv which first came of the act
of legislative definition, if any, or on a par with the law which first came
of the act o f legislative postulation. Revisions, in the cou rse of further
progress, can touch any of these affirmatIons equally. Now [ urge that
scientists, proceeding thus, are not thereby slurring over any meaningful
distinction. Legislative acts occur again and again; on the other hand a
dichotomy of the resulting truths themscIves into analytic and synthetic,
truths by meaning postulate and tfllths by force of nature, has been
given no tolerably clear meaning even as a methodological ideal.
One conspicuous consequence of Carnap's belief in this dichotomy
may be seen in his attitude toward philosophical issues as to what there
is. " It is only by assuming the cleavage between analytic and synthetic
truths that he is able to declare the prohlem of universals to be a matter
not of theory but of linguistic decision. Now [ am as impressed as any­
one with the vastness of what language contrihutes to science and to
one's whole view o f t h e world; and i n particular [ grant t h a t one's hy­
pothesis as to what there is, e.g., as to there being universals, is at bot­
tom j ust as arhitrary or pragmatic a matter as one's adoption of a new
brand of set theory or even a new system o f hook keeping. Canup in
turn recognizes that sllch decisions, however conventional, " will never­
theless usually be influenced by theoretical knowledge . " I e But what im­
presses me more than it does Carnap is how wel l this whole attitude is
suited also to the theoretical hypotheses of natural science itself, and
how little basis there is for a distinction.
The lore of our fathers is a fabric of sentences. In our hands it develops

additions of our own, more or less directly occasioned by the continuing
stimulation of our sense organs. It is a pale gray lore, black with fact and
white with convention. But I have found no substantial reasons for con­

We are prone t o talk and think of o bj ects. Physical obj ects are the obvi·
ous illustration when the illustrative mood is on us, but there are also all
the abstract obj ects, or so there purport to be: the states and qualities,
numbers, attributes, classes. We persist in breaking reality down some­
how into a multiplicity of identifiable and discriminable obj ects, to be re­
ferred to by singular and general terms. We talk so inveterately of obj ects
that to say we do so seems almost to say nothing at all; for how else is
there to tal k ?
It is hard to s a y h o w else there is t o talk, n o t because o u r obj ectifying
pattern is an invariable trait of human nature, but because we are bound
to adapt any alien pattern to our own in the very process of understand­
ing or translating the alien sentences.
I m agine a newly discovered tribe whose language is without known
affinities. The linguist has to learn the language directly by observing
what the natives say under observed circumstances, encountered or con­
trived. He makes a first crude beginning by compiling native terms for
environing objects; but here already he is really imposing his own pat­
terns. Let me explain what I mean. I will grant that the linguist may
esta blish inductively, beyond reasonable doubt, that a certain heathen
expression is one to which natives can be prompted to assent by the pres·
ence o f a rabbit, or reasonable facsimile, and not otherwise . The linguist
is then warranted in according the native expression the cautious trans­
lation "There's a rab bit, " "There we have a rabbit, " "La! a rabbit, "
" Lo ! rabbithood again, " insofar as the differences among these English
sentences are counted irrelevant. This much translation can be objective,
however exotic the tribe. It recognizes the native expression as in effect a
91

92

QUINTESSENCE

rabbit-heralding sentence. But the linguist's bold further step, i n which
he imposes his own object-positing pattern without special warrant, is
taken when he equates the native expression or any part of it with the
term " ra b bit. "
It is easy to show that such appeal to an obj ect category is unwar­
ranted even though we cannot easily, in English, herald rabbits without
objectification. For we can argue fro m indifference. Given that a native
sentence says that a so-and-so is present, and given that the sentence is
true when and only when a rabbit is present, it by no means follows that
the so-and-so are rabbits. They might be all the various temporal seg­
ments of rabbits. They might be all the integral or undetached parts of
rabbits. In order to decide among these alternatives we need to be able to
ask more than whether a so-and-so is present. We need to be able to ask
whether this is the same so-and-so as that, and whether one so-and-so is
present or two. We need something like the apparatus of identity and
quantification; hence fa r more than we are in a position to avail our­
selves of in a language in which our high point as of even date is rab bit­
announcing.
And the case is yet worse: we do not even have evidence for taking the
native expression as of the form " A so-and-so is present " ; it could as
well be construed with an a bstract singular term, as meaning that ra bbit­
hood is locally manifested. Better j ust " Rabbiteth , " like " Raineth . "
But i f o u r linguist i s going t o b e as cagey a s a l l this, h e will never trans­
late more than these simple-minded announcements of observable cur­
rent events. A cagey linguist is a caged linguist. What we want from the
linguist as a serviceable finished product, after all, is no mere list of
sentence-to-sentence equivalences, like the airline throwaways of useful
Spanish phrases. We want a manual of instructions for custom-building
a native sentence to roughly the purpose of any newly composed English
sentence, within reason, and vice versa. The linguist has to resolve the
potential infinity of native sentences into a manageably limited list of
grammatical constructions and constituent linguistic forms, and then
show how the business of each can be approximated in English; and vice
versa. Sometimes perhaps he will translate a word or construction not
directly but contextually, by systematic instructions for translating its
containing sentences; but still he must make do with a limited lot of
contextual definitions. Now once he has carried out this necessary j o b
of lexicography, forwards and backwards, he has r e a d our ontological
point of view into the native language. He has decided what expressions

Speakmg of O bJects

to treat as referring to obj ects, and, within limits, what sorts of obj ects to
treat them as referring to. He has had to decide, however arbitrarily,
how to accommodate English idioms of identity and quantificatio n in
native translation.
The word " arbitrary " needs stressing, not because those decisions are
wholly arbitrary, but because they are so much more so than one tends
to suppose. For, what evidence does the linguist have? He started with
what we may call native observation sentences, such as the rabbit an­
nouncement. These he can say how to translate into English, provided
we impute no relevance to the differences between " Here a rabbit, "
" Here rabbithood, " and the like . Also h e can record further native sen­
tences and settle whether various persons are prepared to affirm or deny
them, though he find no rabbit movements or other currently observable
events to tie them to. Among these untranslated sentences he may get an
occasional hint of logical connections, by finding say that j ust the per­
sons who are prepared to affirm A are prepared to affirm B and deny C.
Thereafter his data leave off and his creativity sets in.
What he does in his creativity is attribute special and distinctive func­
tions to component words, or conspicuously recurrent fragments, of the
recorded sentences. The only ways one can appraise these attributions
are as follows. One can see whether they add up to representing the rab­
bit sentence and the like as conforming to their previously detected truth
conditions. One can see also how well they fit the available data on other
sentences: sentences for which no truth conditions are known, but only
the varying readiness of natives to affirm or deny them. Beyond this we
can j udge the attriburions only on their simplicity and naturalness­
to us.
Certainly the linguist will try our his theory on the natives, springing
new sentences authorized by his theory, to see if they turn out right. This
is a permuting o f the time order: one frames the theory before all possi­
ble data are in, and then lets it guide one in the eliciting of additional
data likeliest to matter. This is good scientific method, but it opens up no
new kind of data. English general and singular terms, identity, quanti­
fication, and the whole bag o f ontological tricks may be correlated with
elements of the native language in any of various mutually incompatible
ways, each compatible with all possible linguistic data, and none prefer­
able to another save as favored by a rationalization o f the native lan­
guage that is simple and natural to us.
It makes no real difference that the linguist will turn bilingual and

93

94

QUINTESSENCE

come to think as the natives do-whatever that means. For the arbitrari­
ness of reading our obj ectifications into the heathen speech reflects not
so m uch the inscruta bility of the heathen mind, as that there is nothing
to scrute. Even we who grew up together and learned English at the same
knee, or adj acent ones, talk alike for no other reason than that society
coached us alike in a pattern of verbal response to externally observable
cues. We have been beaten into an outward conformity to an outward
standard; and thus it is that when I correlate your sentences with mine
by the simple rule of phonetic correspondence, I find that the public cir­
cumstances of your affirmations and denials agree pretty well with those
of my own. If I conclude that you share my sort o f conceptual scheme, I
am not adding a supplementary conj ecture so much as spurning u n fath­
omable distinctions; for, what further criterion of sameness of concep­
tual scheme can be imagined ? The case of a Frenchman, moreover, is the
same except that I correlate his sentences with mine not by phonetic cor­
respondence but according to a traditionally evolved dictionary. ' The
case of the l inguist and his newly discovered heathen, finally, differs sim­
ply in that the linguist has to grope for a general sentence-to-sentence
correlation that will make the public circumstances of the heathen's af­
firmations and denials match up tolera bly with the circumstances of the
linguist's own. If the linguist fails in this, or has a hard time of it, or suc­
ceeds only by dint of an ugly and complex mass of correlations, then he
is entitled to say-in the only sense i n which one can say it-that his hea­
thens have a very different attitude toward reality from ours; and even so
he cannot coherently suggest what their attitude is. Nor, in principle, is
the natural bilingual any better off.
When we compare theories, doctrines, points of view, and cultures, on
the score of what sorts of obj ects there are said to be, we are comparing
them in a respect which itself makes sense only provincially. It makes
sense only as far afield as our efforts to translate our domestic idioms of
identity and quantification bring encouragement in the way of simple
and natural-looking correspondences. If we attend to business we are
unlikely to find a very alien culture with a predilection for a very out­
landish universe of discourse, j ust because the outlandishness of it would
detract from our sense of patness of our dictionary of translation. There
is a notion that our provincial ways of positing objects and conceiving

Yet, for all the difficulty of transcending o u r obj ect-directed pattern of
thought, we can examine it well enough from inside. Let us turn our at­
tention from the heathen, who seemed to have a term for " ra b bit, " to
our own child at home who seems to have j ust acquired his first few
terms in our own language: " m a m a , " " water, " perhaps " red. " To begin
with, the case of the child resembles that of the heathen. I:'or though we
m a y fullv satisfy ourselves that the child has learned the trick of using
the utterances " ma m a " and "water" strictly in the appropriate pres­
ences, o r as means of inducing the appropriate presences, still we have
no right to construe these utterances in the child's mouth as terms, at
first, for things or substances.
We in our m aturity h a ve come to look upon the child's mother as an
integral body who, in a n irregular closed orbit, revisits the child from
time to time; and to look upon red in a radically different way, viz., as
scattered a bout. Water, for us, is rather like red, but not quite; things can
be red, but only stuff is water. But the mother, red, and water a re for the
infant all of a type: each is j ust a history of sporadic encounter, a scat­
tered portion of what goes on. His first learning of the three words is
uniformly a matter o f learning how much of what goes on a bout him
counts as the mother, or as red, or as water. It is not for the child to say in
the first case " I [ello! mama again, " in the second case " Hello ! a nother
red thing," and in the third case " lIello! more water. " 'rhey arc all on a
par: Hell o ! more mama, more red, more water. Even this last formula,
which treats all three terms on the model of our provincial adult bulk
term " water, " is imperfect; for it unwarranted I )' i mputes a n obj ectifica­
tion of matter, even if only as stuff and not as hits.
Progressively, however, the child is seen to evolve a pattern of verbal
behavior that finally comes to copy ours too closely for there to be any
sense in questioning the general sameness of conceptual scheme. For per2 . For <-l fuller development of the foregomg theme �ce my " .M eaomg and Tra nsla­

spective on O ll r own obj ectifying apparatus we may consider what steps
of development make the difference hetween the " ma ma " -hahbling i n ­
fant w h o canll ot be s aid to he u si n g terms for obj ects, and t h e o l d er child
who can.
It is only when the child has got on to the full and proper use of
illdividuative terms like "apple" that he can properly he said to have
taken to using terms as terms, and speaking of obj ects. Words like " ap­
ple," and not words like "' mama " or " water" or " rcd , " are the terms
whose ontological involvement runs deep. To learn " apple " it is not suf­
ficient to learn how much of what goes on counts as apple; we must
learn how much counts as all apple, and how much as another. Such
terms possess built-in modes of individuation.
Individuative terms are commonly made to double as bulk terms .
Thus we may say "There is some apple in the salad," not meaning " some
apple or othe r " ; just as we may say " Mary had a little lamb" in either of
two senses. Now we have appreciated that the child can learn the terms
" mama , " " red, " and " wate r " quite well before he ever has mastered the
ins and o uts of our adult conceptual scheme of mohile enduring physical
obj ects, identical from time to time and place to place; and in principle
he might do the same for " apple, " as a bulk term for uncut apple stuff.
But he can never fully master " apple" in its individuative use, except as
he gets on with the scheme of enduring and recurrent physical ohj ects.
He may come somewhat to grips with the individuative use of " apple "
hefore quite mastering the comprehensive physical outlook, hut his us­
age will he marred hy misidentifications of distinct apples over time, or
misdiscriminations of identical ones.
He has rea lly got on to the individuative use, one is tempted to sup­
pose, once he responds with the plural " apples " to a heap of apples. But
not so. He may at that point have learned "apples" as another bulk
term, applicable to j ust so much apple as is taken up in apple heaps.
" Apples, " for him, would be subordinated to " apple " as is " warm wa­
ter" to " water, " and " hright red " to "red . "
The child might proceed t o acquire " hlock " a n d " hlocks," " h a l l " and
" balls, " as hulk terms in the same fashion. By the force of analogy
among such pairs he might even come to apply the plural " - s " with
seeming appropriateness to new words, and to drop it with seeming ap­
propriateness from words first learned only with it. We might well not
detect, for a while, his misconception: that " -s " j ust turns bulk terms
into more specialized hulk terms connoting dumpiness.

Spea kmg of OhJect,

A plausible variant misconception is thi,: " apple" b u l kwise might
cover j ust the apple stuff that is spaced off i n lone apples, while " apples "
still figures as last suggested. Then apples and apple would be mutually
exclusive rather than subordinate the one to the other. This variant mis­
conception could likewise be proj ected sy>tematically to " bl ock " and
" block s , " " ba l l " a n d " balls, " and long escape exposure.
How can we ever tell, then, whether the child as real l y got the trick of
individuati o n ? Only by engaging him in sophisticated d iscourse of " that
apple , " " not that apple, " "an apple, " "same apple , " " another apple , "
" these apples. " I t is o n l y at this level that a palpable difference emerges
between genuinely individuative use and the conterfeits lately imagined.
Doubtless the child gets the swing of these peculia r adj ectives " same,"
"another, " "an," " that, " " not that, " contextually: first he becomes at­
tuned to various longer phrases or sentence> that contain them, and then
gradually he develops appropriate habits in relation to the component
words as common parts and residues of those longer forms. His tentative
acquisition of the plural " - s , " lately speculated on, is itsel f a first primi­
tive step of the kind. The contextual learning o f these various particles
goes on simultaneously, we may suppose, so that they are gradually ad­
j usted to one another a nd a coherent pattern of usage is evolved match­
ing that of one's elders. This is a major step in acquiring the conceptual
scheme that we all know so well . For it is on achieving this step, and only
then, that there can be any general talk of obj ects as such. Only at this
stage does it begin to make sense to wonder whether the apple now in
one's hand is the apple noticed yesterday.
Until individuation emerges, the child can scarcely be said to have
general or singular terms, there being no express talk of obj ects. The pre­
individuative term " mama, " and likewise "wate r " and " red " ( for chil­
dren who happen to learn " water" and " re d " before mastering individu­
atio n ) , hark back to a primitive phase to which the distinction between
singular and general is irrelevant. Once the child ha> pulled through the
individuative crisis, though, he is prepared to reassess prior terms.
" Mama, " i n particular, gets set up retroactivel y as the n a me of a broad
and recurrent but withal individual obj ect, and thus as a singular term
par excellence. Occasions eliciting " ma ma " being just as discontinuous
as those eliciting " water, " the two terms had been on a par; but with the
advent of individuation the mother becomes i ntegrated i nt o a cohesive
spatiotemporal convexity, while water remains scattered even in space­
time. The two terms thus part company.

QUINTESSENCE

The mastery of individuation seems scarcely to affect people's attitude
toward " water. " For " water, " " s ugar, " and the like the category of bulk
terms remains, a survival of the pre-individuative phase, ill fitting the di­
chotomy into general and singular. But the philosophical mind sees its
way to pressing this archaic category into the dichotomy. The bulk term
" water" after the copula can usually be smoothly reconstrued as a gen­
eral term true of each portion of water, while i n other positions it is usu­
ally more simply construed as a singular term naming that spatiotem­
porally diffuse obj ect which is the totality of the world's water.
III

I have urged that we could know the necessary and sufficient stimulatory
conditions of every possible act of utterance, in a foreign language, and
still not know how to determine what obj ects the speakers of that lan­
guage believe in. Now i f obj ective reference is so inaccessible to observa­
tion, who i s to say an empirical grounds that belief in obj ects of one or
another description is right or wrong ? How ca n there ever be empirical
evidence against existential statements ?
The answer is something like this. Grant that a knowledge of the ap­
propriate stimulatory conditions of a sentence does not settle how to
construe the sentence i n terms of existence of obj ects . Still, it does tend
to settle what is to count as empirical evidence for or against the truth of
the sentence. If we then go on to assign the sentence some import in
point of existence of objects, by arbitrary proj ection in the case of the
heathen language or as a matter of cou rse in the case of our own, there­
upon what has already been counting as empirical evidence for or
against the truth of the sentence comes to count as empirical evidence for
or against the existence of the obj ects .
The opportun ity for error in existential statements increases with
one's mastery of the verbal apparatus of objective reference. In one's
earliest phase of word learning, terms like " mama " and " water" were
learned which may be viewed retrospectively as names each of an ob­
served spatiotemporal obj ect. Each such term was learned by a process
of reinforcement and extinction, whereby the spatiotemporal range of
application of the term was gradually perfected. The o b ject named is as­
suredly an observed one, in the sense that the reinforced stimu l i pro­
ceeded pretty directly from it. Granted, this talk of name and obj ect be­
longs to a later phase of language learning, even as does the talk of
stimulation.

Speak ing of OhJec"

The second phase, marked by the advent of individuanw terms, is
where a proper notion of obj ect emerges. lIere we get general terms,
each true of each of many objects. But the obj ects still a rc observable
spatiotemporal obj ects. For these individuative terms, e.g. " clpple , " are
learned still by the old method of reinforcement aod extinction; they dif­
fer from their predecessors only in the added feature of internal individu­
ation.
Demoostrative singular tcrms like 'Cthis apple " usher i n a third phase,
characterized by the fact that a singular term seriously used can now,
through error, fail to name: the thing pointed to can turn out to he the
mere fa,ade of an apple, or maybe a tomato. flut even at this stage any­
thing that we do succeed in naming is still a n observable spatiotemporal
object.
A fou rth phase comes with the joining of one general term to another
in attributive position . Now for the first time we can get general terms
which are not true of anything; thus c' blue apple," ,cslj u are ball . " But
when there arc things at all of which the thm formed general terills are
true, they are still nothing new; they arc just sOllle among the saille old
o bservables wbereof the component terms a re true.
It is a fi ftb phase that brings a new Illode of u n derstandi ng, giving ac­
cess to new sorts of obj ects. When we form compounds by applving rela­
tive terms to singular terms, we get such compounds as cCsmallcr than
that speck . " Whereas the non-existence of observable blue apples is tan­
tamount to the non-existence of blue apples, the non-exIstence of ob­
servable objects smaller than that speck is not taken as tantamount to
the non-existence of obj ects smaller than that speck. The notable feature
of this fifth phase is not that it enables us to form mea n ingful singular
terms devoid of reference, for that was alreadv ach ieved on occasion
with C'this apple " ; nor that it enables us to form meaningful general
terms true of nothing, for that was already achieved with ,c blne apple " ;
but that i t enables us, for the first time, t o form terms whose references
can be admitted to be forever unobservable without yet bel llg repu d i ­
ated, l i k e blue apples, as n O ll-existent.
Such applying of relative terms to singular terlll S I S the simplest
method of forming terms that purport to name unobservables, but there
are also more flexible devices to much the same effect: the relative clause
and description.
And there comes yet a sixth phase, when we break through to posits
more drastically new still than the obj ects smaller than the smallest VIsi­
ble speck. For the obj ects smaller than the speck differ from observahle

99

1 00

Q U I N T E S S E N C r:

ohj ects only in a matter of degree, whereas the sixth phase ushers in
a bstract entities. This phase is marked by the advent of abstract singu­
lar terms like " redness, " " roundness , " " mankind, " purported names of
qualities, attributes, classes. Let us speculate on the mechanism of this
new move.
One wedge is the bulk term. Such terms can be learned at the very first
phase, we saw, on a par with " mama . " We saw them diverge from
" mama " at the second phase, simply on the score that the woman comes
then to be appreciated as an integrated spatiotemporal thing while the
world's water or red stuff ordinarily docs not. For the child, thus, who is
not on to the sophisticated idea of the scattered single object, the bulk
term already has an air of generality abour it, comparable to the indi­
viduative " apple " ; and still it is much like the singular " mama" in form
and fu nction, having even been learned or learnable at the first phase on
a par with " mama . " So the bulk term already has rather the hybrid air of
the abstract singular term. "Water" might, from the very advent of indi­
viduation, even be said to name a shared attribute of the sundry puddles
and glassfuls rather than a scattered portion of the world composed of
those puddles and glassfuls; for the child of course adopts neither posi­
tion .
.\1oreover, there is a tricky point about color words that especially en­
courages the transition to abstract reference. "Red" can be learned as a
bulk term, like " water, " but in particular it applies to apples whose in­
sides are white. Before mastering the conceptual scheme of individuation
and enduring physical obj ect, the child sees the uncut red apple, like to­
mato j u ice, simply as so much red exposure in the passing show, and,
having no sense of physical identity, he sees the suhsequently exposed
white interior of the apple as irrelevant. When eventually he does master
the conceptual scheme of individuation and enduring physical object,
then, he has to come to terms with a preacquired use of " re d " that has
suddenly gone double: there is red stuff ( tomato j uice) and there are red
things ( apples) that are mostly white stuff. "Red" both remains a bulk
term of the ancient vintage of " water " and "mama," and becomes a
concrete general term like "round " or " apple . " Since the child will still
not clearly conceive of " re d " as suddenly two words, we have him some­
how infusing singularity into the concrete general; and such is the rec­
ipe, however unappetizing, for the abstract singular. The analogy then
spreads to other general terms, that were in no such special predicament
as " red, " until they all deliver abstract singulars.

Speaking of Obj ects

Another force for abstract terms, or for the positing of a bstract obj ects,
lies in a bbreviated cross-reference. E.g., a fter an elaborate remark re­
garding President Eisenhower, someone says: "The same holds for Chur­
chill." Or, by way of supporting some botanical identification, one says:
" Both plants have the following attribute in common"-and proceeds
with a double-purpose description. In such cases a laborious repetition is
conveniently circumvented. Now the cross- reference in such cases is j ust
to a form of words. But we have a stubborn tendency to reify the unre­
peated matter by positing an attribute, instead o f j ust talking of words.
There is indeed an archaic precedent for confusing sign and obj ect; the
earliest conditioning of the infant's babbling is ambiguous on the point.
For suppose a baby rewarded for happening to babble something like
" ma ma " or " water" j ust as the mother or water is looming. The stimuli
which are thus reinforced are bound to be two : there is not only the
looming of the obj ect, there is equally the word itself, heard by the child
from his own lips. Confusion of sign and obj ect is original sin, coeval
with the word.
We have seen how the child might slip into the community's ontol ogy
of attributes by easy stages, from bulk terms onward. We have also seen
how talk of attributes will continue to be encouraged, in the child and
the community, by a certain convenience of cross-reference coupled with
a confusion of sign and obj ect. We have in these reflections some materi­
als for speculation regarding the early beginnings of an ontology of attri­
butes in the childhood of the race. There is room, as well, for alternative
or supplementary conj ectures; e.g., that the attributes are vestiges of the
minor deities of some creed outworn. ' In a general way such speculation
is epistemologically relevant, as suggesting how organisms maturing and
evolving in the physical environment we know might conceivably end up
discoursing of abstract objects as we do. But the d isreputa bility of ori­
gins is of itself no argument against preserving and prizing the a bstract
ontology. This conceptual scheme may well be, however accidenral, a
happy accident; j ust as the theory of electrons would be none the worse
for having first occurred to its originator in the course of some a bsurd
dream. At any rate the ontology of a bstract objects is part of the ship
which, in Neurath's figure, we are rebuilding at sea.· We may revise the

scheme, but only in favor o f some clearer or simpler and no less ade­
quate overall account of what goes on in the world.
IV

By finding out roughly which non-verbal stimulations tend to prompt as­
sent to a given existential statement, we settle, to some degree, what is to
count as empirical evidence for or against the existence of the obj ects in
question. This I urged at the beginning of III. Statements, however, exis­
tential and otherwise, vary in the directness with which they are condi­
tioned to non-verbal stimulation. Commonly a stimulation will trigger
our verdict on a statement only because the statement is a strand in the
verbal network of some ela borate theory, other strands of which are
more directly conditioned to that stimulation. Most of our statements
respond thus to reverberations across the fabric of intra linguistic associ­
ations, even when also directly conditioned to extralinguistic stimuli to
some degree. Highly theoretical statements are statements whose con­
nection with extralinguistic stimulation consists pretty exclusively in the
reverberations across the fa bric. Statements of the existence of various
sorts of subvisible particles tend to be theoretical, in this sense; and, even
more so, statements of the existence o f certain abstract o bjects. Com­
monly such statements are scarcely to be j u dged otherwise than by co­
herence, or by considerations of overall simplicity of a theory whose ulti­
mate contacts with experience are remote as can be from the statements
in question . Yet, remarkably enough, there are abstract existence state­
ments that do succumb to such considerations. We have had the wit to
posit an ontology massive enough to crumble of its own weight.
For there are the paradoxes of classes . These paradoxes are usually
stated for classes because classes are a relatively simple kind of abstract
object to talk a bout, and also because classes, being more innocent on
the face of them than attributes, are more fun to discredit. In any event,
as is both well k nown and obvious, the paradoxes of classes go through
pari passu for attributes, and again fo r relations.
The moral to draw from the paradoxes is not necessarily nominalism,
but certainly that we must tighten our ontological belts a few holes. The
law of attributes that was implicit in our language habits or that fitted in
with them most easily was that every statement that mentions a thing at­
tributes an attribute to it; and this cultural heritage, however venerable,
must go. Some j udicious ad hoc excisions are required at least.

Speaking of Obj e c ts

Systematic considerations can press not only for repudiating certain
objects, and so declaring certain terms irreferential; they can also press
for declaring certain occurrences of terms irreferential, while other oc­
currences continue to refer. This point is essentially Frege's, \ and an ex­
ample is provided by the sentence " Tom believes that Tully wrote the A rs
Magna. " If we assert this on the strength of Tom's confusion of Tully
with Lully, and in full appreciation of Tom's appreciation that Cicero did
not write the A rs Magna, then we are not giving the term "Tully " purely
referential occurrence in o ur sentence " Tom believes that Tully wrote the
A rs Magna " ; our sentence is not squarely about Tully. If it were, it would
have to be true of Cicero, who is Tully.
It was only after somehow deciding what heathen locutions to con­
strue as identity and the like that our linguist could begin to say which
heathen words serve as terms and what objects they refer to. It was only
after getting the knack of identity and kindred devices that our own
child could reasonably be said to be talking in terms and to be talking of
obj ects. And it is to the demands of identity still, specifically the �ub­
stitutivity of identity, that the adult speaker o f our language remains an­
swerable as l ong as he may be said to be using terms to refer.
We are free so to use the verb " believes " as to allow ensuing terms full
referential status after all. To do so is to deny "Tom believes that Tully
wrote the A rs Magna " in the l ight of Tom 's knowledge of Cicero and de­
spite his confusion of names. The fact is that we can and do use " be­
lieves " both ways : one way when we say that Tom believes that Tully
wrote the A rs Magna, and the other way when we deny this, or when, re­
sorting to quantification, we say j ust that there is someone whom Tom
believes to have done thus and so. Parallel remarks are suited also to oth­
ers of the propositional attitudes, as Russell calls them: thus doubting,
wishing, and striving, along with believing.
Man in a state of nature is not aware of the doubleness of these usages
of his, nor of the strings attached to each; j ust as he is not aware of the
paradoxical consequences of a naive ontology of classes or attributes.
Now yet another ontological weakness that we are likewise unaware of

until, philosophically minded, we start looking to coherence consider­
ations, has to do with the individuation of attributes.
The positing of attributes is accompanied by no clue as to the circum­
stanccs under which attributes may be said to be the same or different.
This is perverse, considering that the very use of terms and the very pos­
iting of object, are unrecognizable to begin with except as keyed in with
idioms of sameness and difference. What happens is that at first we learn
general patterns of term-talk and thing-talk with the help of the neces­
sary adjuncts of identity; afterward we proj ect these well-learned gram­
matical forms to attributes, without settling identity for them . We un­
derstand the forms as referential j ust because they are grammatically
analogous to ones that we learned earlier, for physical obj ects, with full
dependence o n the identity aspect.
The lack of a proper identity concept for attributes is a lack that phi­
losophers feel impelled to supply; for, what sense is there in saying that
there are attributes when there is no sense in saying when there is one at­
tribute and when two ? Carnap and others have proposed this principle
for identifying attri butes: two sentences about x attribute the same attri­
bute to x if and only if the two sentences arc not merely alike in truth
value for each choice of x, but necessarily and a nalytically so, by same­
ness of meaning.'
However, this formulation depends on a questionable notion, that of
sameness o f meaning. For let us not slip back into the fantasy of a gallery
of ideas and labels. Let u s remember rather our field lexicographer's pre­
dicament: how arbitrary his proj ection of analogies from known lan­
guages. Can an empiricist speak seriously of sameness of meaning of two
conditions upon an object x, one stated in the heathen language and one
in ours, when even the singling out of an o bj ect x as obj ect at all for the
heathen language is so hopelessly arbitrary ?
We could skip the heathen language and try talking of sameness of
meaning j ust within our own language. This would degrade the ontology
of attributes; identity of attributes would be predicated on frankly pro­
vincial traits of English usage, ill fitting the objectivity of tru e obj ects.
Nor let it be said in extenuation that all talk of obj ects, physical ones in­
cluded, is in a way provincial too; for the way is different. Our physics is
provincial only in that there is no universal basis for translating it into

remote languages; it would still never condone defining physical identity
in terms of verbal behavior. If we rest the identity of attributes on a n ad­
mittedly local relation of English synonymy, then we count attributes
secondary to language in a way that physical obj ects are not.
Shall we j ust let attributes be thus secondary to language in a way that
physical objects are not? But our troubles do not end here; for the fact is
that I see no hope of making reasonable sense of sameness of meaning
even for English. The difficulty is one that I have enlarged on elsewhere.?
English expressions are supposed to mean the same if, vaguely speaking,
you can use one for the other in any situation and any English context
without relevant difference of effect; and the essential difficulty comes in
delimiting the required sense of relevant.

There is no denying the access of power that accrues to our conceptual
scheme through the positing of abstract objects . Most of what is gained
by positing attributes, however, is gained equally by positing classes.
Classes are on a par with attributes on the score of a bstractness or uni­
versality, and they serve the purposes of attributes so far as mathematics
and certainly most of science are concerned; and they enj oy, unlike attri­
butes, a crystal-clear identity concept. No wonder that in mathematics
the murky intensionality of attributes tends to give way to the limpid
extensionality of classes; and likewise in other sciences, roughly in pro­
portion to the rigor and austerity of their systematization.
For attributes one might still claim this advantage over classes: they
help in systematizing what we may call the attributary attitudes hunt
ing, wanting, fearing, lacking, and the like. For example, take hunting.
Lion hunting is not, like lion catching, a transaction between men and
individual lions; for it requires no lions. We analyze lion catching, rabbit
catching, etc. as having a catching relation in common and varying only
i n the individuals caught; but what of lion hunting, rabbit hunting, etc. ?
If any common relation is to be recognized here, the varying objects of
the relation must evi dently be taken not as individuals but as kinds. Yet

not kinds in the sense of classes, for then unicorn hunting would cease to
differ from griffin hunting. Kinds rather in the sense of attributes.
Some further supposed abstract obj ects that are like attributes, with
respect to the identity problem, are the propositions-in the sense of en­
tities that somehow correspond to sentences as attributes correspond to
predicates. Now if attributes clamor for recognition as obj ects of the
attributary attitudes, so do propositions as obj ects of the propositional
attitudes: believing, wishing, and the rest.'
Overwhelmed by the problem of identity of attributes and of proposi­
tions, however, one may choose to make a clean sweep of the lot, and
undertake to manage the attributary and propositional attitudes some­
how without them. Philosophers who take this austere line will perhaps
resort to actual l i nguistic forms, sentences, instead of propositions, as
obj ects of the propositional attitudes; and to actual linguistic forms,
predicates, instead of attributes, as obj ects of the attributary attitudes.
Against such resort to l inguistic forms one hears the following obj ec­
tion, due to Church and Langford.' If what are believed are mere sen­
tences, then " Edwin believes the English sentence S" goes correctly into
German as " Edwin glaubt den englischen Satz S, " with S unchanged. But
it also goes correctly into German as " Edwin glaubt" followed by a
German translation of S in indirect discourse. These two German re­
ports, one quoting the English sentence and the other using German in­
direct discourse, must then be equivalent. But they are not, it is argued,
since a German ignorant of English cannot equate them. Now I am not
a ltogether satisfied with this argument. It rests on the notion of linguistic
equivalence, or sameness of meaning; and this has seemed dubious as a
tool of philosophical analysis. There is, however, another obj ection to
taking l inguistic forms as objects of the attributary and propositional at­
titudes; viz., simply that that course is discouragingly artificial. With this
obj ection I sympathize.
Perhaps, after all, we should be more receptive to the first and least
premeditated of the alternatives. We might keep attributes and proposi­
tions after all, but just not try to cope with the problem of their individu­
ation. We might deliberately acquiesce i n the old unregenerate positing

of attri butes and propositions without hint of a standard of identity. The
precept "No entity without identity " might simply be relaxed. Certainly
the positing of first obj ects makes no sense except as keyed to identity;
but those patterns of thing talk, once firmly inculcated, have i n fact en­
abled us to talk of attributes and propositions in partial grammatical
analogy, without an accompanying standard of identity for them. Why
not j ust accept them thus, as twilight half-entities to which the identity
concept is not to apply ? 10 If the disreputability of their origins is undeni­
a ble, still bastardy, to the enlightened mind, is no disgrace . This liberal
line accords with the Oxford philosophy of ordinary language, much
though I should regret, by my sympathetic reference, to cause any twinge
of sorrow to my revered predecessor in this presidential chair.
What might properly count against countenancing such half-entities,
inaccessible to identity, is a certain disruption of logic. For, if we are to
tolerate the half-entities without abdication of philosophical responsibil­
ity, we must adj ust the logic of our conceptual scheme to receive them,
and then weigh any resulting complexity against the benefits of the half­
entities in connection with propositional and attributary attitudes and
elsewhere.
But I am not sure that even philosophical responsibility requires set­
tling for one all-purpose system. 1 1 Propositional and attributary atti­
tudes belong to daily discourse of hopes, fears, and purposes; causal sci­
ence gets on well without them. The fact that science has shunned them
and fared so well could perhaps encourage a philosopher of sanguine
temper to try to include that erstwhile dim domain within an overhauled
universal system, science-worthy throughout. But a reasonable if less
ambitious alternative would be to keep a relatively simple and austere
conceptual scheme, free of half-entities, for official scientific business,
and then accommodate the half-entities i n a second-grade system.
In any event the idea of accommodating half-entities without identity
illustrates how the individuative, obj ect-oriented conceptual scheme so
natural to us could conceivably begin to evolve away.
It seemed i n our reflections on the child that the category of bulk terms
was a survival of a pre-individuative phase. We were thinking onto1 0. F regc dId '0 10 Grundgesetze der A rtthmetlk, where he was at pams not to

genetically, but the phylogenetic parallel is plausible too: we may have in
the bulk term a relic, half vestigial and half adapted, of a pre-individ­
uative phase in the evolution of our conceptual scheme. And some day,
correspondingly, something of our present individuative talk may in turn
end up, half vestigial and half adapted, within a new and as yet unimag­
ined pattern beyond individuation.
Transition to some such radically new pattern could occur either
through a conscious philosophical enterprise or by slow and unreasoned
development along lines of least resistance. A combination of both fac­
tors is likeliest; and anyway the two differ mainly in degree of deliberate­
ness. Our patterns of thought or language have been evolving, under
pressure of inherent inadequacies and changing needs, since the dawn of
language; and, whether we help guide it or not, we may confidently look
forward to more of the same.
Translation of our remote past or future discourse into the terms we
now know could be about as tenuous and arbitrary a projection as trans­
lation of the heathen language was seen to be. Conversely, even to speak
of that remote medium as radically different from ours is, as remarked in
the case of the heathen language, to say no more than that the trans­
lations do not come smoothly. We have, to be sure, a mode of access to
future stages of our own evolution that is denied us in the case of the
heathen language: we can sit and evolve. But even those historical grada­
tions, if somehow traced down the ages and used as clues to translation
between widely separated evolutionary stages, would still be gradations
only, and in no sense clues to fixed ideas beneath the flux of language.
For the obstacle to correlating conceptual schemes is not that there is
anything ineffable about language or culture, near or remote. The whole
truth about the most outlandish linguistic behavior is j ust as accessible
to us, i n our current Western conceptual scheme, as are other chapters of
zoology. The obstacle is only that any one intercultural correlation of
words and phrases, and hence of theories, will be j ust one among various
empirically admissible correlations, whether it is suggested by historical
gradations or by unaided analogy; there is nothing for such a correlation
to be uniquely right or wrong about. In saying this I philosophize from
the vantage point only of our own provincial conceptual scheme and sci­
entific epoch, true; but I know no better.

There were advantages, we saw ( § 3 ) , in starting with observation sen­

of reification could be deferred for consideration until an epistemo­

Incipient reification can already be sensed in the predicational obser­
vation sentences ( § 2 ) . That mode of combination favors, as components,
observation sentences that focus on conspicuously limited portions of
the scene; for the compound expresses coincidence of such foci.
A second step of reification, and a step beyond ordinary o bservation
sentences, was recognizable in the move to focal observation categori­
cals ( § 4 ) . I think of the child as first mastering this construction, like the
free observation categorical, simply as a generalized expression of expec­
tation: whenever this, that. For her the difference between the two kinds
of categorical would not at first obtrude. The difference is, we recall,
that the focal categorical requires the two features-'Raven' and 'Black,'
say-to fuse in the scene, while the free categorical does not. However,
the scenes first associated with 'Raven' will show a raven at the salient
focus, and those first associated with 'Black' will show black at the sa­
lient focus. Insofar, the free categorical a l ready meets the focal demand.
The difference between the free and the focal in other cases, and between
conj unction and predication ( § 2 ) , can gradually dawn on the child in its
own time.
By virtue of its narrowed focus, however, the focal observation cate­
gorical-unlike the free one-has decidedly the air of general discourse
about bodies: willows in the one example, ravens in the other. This is
1 09

1 10

where I see bodies materializing, onto logically speaking: as ideal nodes
at the foci of intersecting observation sentences. Here, I suggest, is the
root of reification.
For the very young child, who has not got beyond observation sen­
tences, the recurrent presentation of a body is much on a par with simi­
larities of stimulation that clearly do not prompt reification. Recurrent
confrontation of a ball is on a par at first with mere recurrent exposure
to sunshine or cool air: the question whether it is the same old ball or
one like it makes no more sense than whether it is the same old sun­
beam, the same old breeze. Experience is in its feature-placing stage, in
Strawson's phrase. Individuation comes only l ater.
True, an infant is observed to expect a steadily moving obj ect to reap­
pear after it passes behind a screen; but this all happens within the spe­
cious present, and reflects rather the expectation of contin uity of a pres­
ent feature tha n the reification o f an i ntermittently absent obj ect. Again
a dog's recognition of a recurrent individual is beside the point; the dog
is responding to a distinctive odor or other trait, unavailable in the case
of qualitatively indistinguishable balls.
To us the question whether we are seeing the same old ball or j ust a
similar one is meaningful even in cases where it remains unanswered. It
is here that the reification of bodies is full blown . Our venerable theory
of the persistence and recurrence of bodies is characteristic of the use of
reification in integrating our system of the world. If I were to try to de­
cide whether the penny now in my pocket is the one that was there last
week, or j ust another one like it, I would have to explore quite varied as­
pects of my overall scheme of things, so as to reconstruct the simplest,
most plausible account o f my interim movements, costumes, and expen­
ditures.
Perhaps such indirect equating and distinguishing of bodies is
achieved by some other animals to some extent. Perhaps a dog seeking a
ball that disappeared fairly recently in one quarter will not settle for a
similar ball at an unlikely distance. However that may be, it seems clear
that such reification of bodies across time is beyond the reach of obser­
vation sentences and categoricals. Substantial reification is theoretical.
1 0 . Va lues of Variables

Even our sophisticated conception of enduring and recurrent bodies,
so characteristic of our human ontology, is for us little more than a be-

Reference

ginning. With our progressive systematization of science we have gone
on to reify liquids and the invisible air, and we have integrated these
things with bodies by reckoning them as aggregates of bodies too small
to be detected. Nor have we stopped here. Abstract obj ects have long
since proved indispensable to natural science-thus num bers, functions,
classes.
At this level a question arises of what to count as reification, and what
to count rather as just a useful but ontologically n o ncommittal turn of
phrase; for the idea that seemed to mark so decisively the reification of
bodies, namely persistence between exposures, makes no sense for ab­
stract obj ects. I have urged elsewhere that the most decisive general
marks of reification in our l anguage and kindred ones are the pronouns,
and indeed it was 'it' in ( 1 ) of § 4 that signaled those early rumblings of
reification in the focal observation categoricals. The theme is taken up in
full by the relative pronouns and their auxiliaries. ' When a language is
regimented in the logical notation of the predicate calculus, the role of
such pronouns is played by bound variables.
Observation sentences are to be taken holophrastically from the
standpoint of evidence, I urged ( § 3 ) , and analytically word by word
from the retrospective standpoint of theory. From the latter standpoint a
focal observation categorical is an outright quantification. ' Ravens are
black' becomes

Vx(x is a raven .

� .

x is black ) .

Free observational categoricals would be construed similarly, usually by
quantifying over times or places.
So I have insisted down the years that to be is to be the value of a vari­
able. More precisely, what one takes there to be are what one admits as
values of one's bound variables. The point has been recognized as obvi­
ous and trivial, but it has also been deemed unacceptable, even by read­
ers who share my general philosophical outlook. Let me sort out some of
the considerations.
The artificial notation '3x' of existential quantification is explained
merely as a symbolic rendering of the words 'there is something x such
that. ' So, whatever more one may care to say about being or existence,
what there are taken to be are assuredly just what are taken to qualify as
values of 'x' in quantifications. The point is thus trivial and obvious.

It has been objected that what there is is a question of fact and not of
language . True enough. Saying or implying what there is, however, is a
matter of language; and this is the place of the bound variables.
It has been obj ected that the logical notation of quantification is an ar­
bitrary and parochial standard to adopt for ontological commitment.
The a nswer is that the standard is transferable to any alternative lan­
guage, insofar as we are agreed on how to translate quantification into
it. For predicate-functor logic, thus, the equivalent principle is that what
one takes there to be are what one takes one's monadic predicates (com­
plements included) to be true of. For ordinary English what one takes
there to be are what one takes one's relative pronouns to refer to. O rdi­
nary discourse is indeed seldom meticulous about ontology, and conse­
quently an assessment based on the relative pronouns of ordinary dis­
course is apt to bespeak a pretty untidy world; but ontological clarity
and economy can be promoted b y paraphrase, if one so desires, in terms
still of relative clauses and pronouns rather than quantifiers and bound
variables. The notation of quantification is what is most usual and famil­
iar, currently, where one is expressly concerned with ontological niceties;
hence my choice of it as paradigm.
One thinks o f reference, first and foremost, as relating names and
other singular terms to their obj ects . Yet singular terms often fail to refer
to anything. Conversely, also, set theory teaches that there are bound to
be individually unspecifiable objects-unspecifiable irrational numbers,
notably-no matter how rich our notation and cumbersome our expres­
sions. Variables, on the other hand, take all obj ects as values, irrespec­
tive of specifiability.
Once our language is regimented to fit the predicate calculus, more­
over, it is easy and instructive to dispense with singular terms altogether,
leaving variables as the only link to objects. The underlying principle
here is the equivalence of '3x (Fx and a = x)' to 'Fa ' ; for this enables us
to maneuver every occurrence of 'a' into the context 'a = and then to
treat that context as an indissoluble predicate ' A , ' absorbing the singular
term. Singular terms can still be recovered afterward as a convenient
shorthand, by introducing singular description in Russell's way and de­
fining 'a' as ' ( 1x ) A x . "
If in s o m e language we are at a l o s s to arrive at a satisfactory contex­
tual translation of 'there is,' and hence of existential quantification, then

we arc at a loss to assess the ontology of the speakers of that language.
Some languages are perhaps so unlike ours that any translation of 'there
is' or '3x,' however cunningly contextual, would be too far-fetched and
Procrustean to rest with. To entertain the notion of an ontology at all,
known or unknown, for the speakers of such a language would be an un­
warranted proj ection on our part of a paroch ial category appropriate
only to our own linguistic circle. Thus r do recognize that the question of
ontological commitment is parochial, though within a much broader
parish than that of the speakers and writers of symbolic logic.
1 1 . Utility o f Reification

We detected the first hint of reification in the predicational compounding
of observation sentences, as contrasted with simple conjunction. Predi­
cation is a stronger connection than conjunction; it requires immersion
of the pebble in the blue ( § 2 ) and the raven in the black, while mere con­
junction allows the features to go their separate ways.
At its inception, thus, we find reification contributing to the logical
connections between observation and theory by tightening up on truth
functions. Elsewhere I have made the point more emphatically by a four­
part example:
(1)

A white cat is facing a dog and bristling.

Four simple observation sentences underlie this. One is 'Cat,' or, on the
analogy of the ontologically innocent 'It's raining,' 'It's catting.' The oth­
ers are 'White,' 'Dog-facing,' and 'Bristling.' But ( 1 ) cannot be rendered
as a mere conj unction of these four, because the conj unction is too loose.
It tells us only that the four things are going on in the same scene. We
want them all in the same part of the scene, superimpose d . It is this tight­
ening that is achieved by subj ecting the four-fold conj unction to existen­
tial quantification, thus:
Something is catting and is white and is dog-facing and
is bristling,
which is to say ( 1 ) . An obj ect has been posited, a cat . '

For all its complexity, ( 1 ) is an observation sentence. It could be ac­
quired by direct conditioning to the complex situation that it reports, if
this situation were to recur and be reported oftener than one is prepared
to expect. Bur it is illustrative of a n unlimited lot of equally complex and
unlikely o hservation sentences. There is no hope of direct acquisition of
each; systematic construction from elements is mandatory. Reification,
we see, to the rescue.
For purposes of that context, a cat of the moment would suffice; no
need of an enduring cat. To illustrate the need of an enduring cat I must
go beyond o bservation sentences and suppose that we have somehow
worked our way far enough up into scientific theory to treat of time; ear­
lier and later. Suppose then we want to convey this thought:
(21

If a cat eats a spoiled fish and sickens, then she will thereafter
avoid fish.

We cannot treat this as a simple " if-then" compound of two self-suf­
ficient component sentences. Like the " a n d " of the preceding example,
the " if-then" connection is too weak . It has to he the same cat in both
sentences, and hence an enduring cat. Our sentence is really a universally
quantified conditional:
Everything is such that if it is a cat and it cats a spoiled fish and
it sickens then it will thereafter avoid fish.
Hilary Putnam and Charles Parsons have both remarked on ways of
economizing on abstract obj ects by recourse to a modal operator of pos­
sibility.4 We have j ust observed the other side of the same coin: the posit­
ing of obj ects can serve to reinforce the weak truth functions without re­
course to modal operators. Where there are such trade-offs to choose
between, I a m for positing the obj ects. I posit abstract ones grudgingly
on the whole, bur gratefully where the alternative course would call for
modal operators. ( Cf. § 3 0 . 1
My examples offer a crude notion of how it may be that reification
and reference contrihute to the elaborate structure that relates science to
its sensory evidence. At its most rudimentary level, reificatian is a device
far focusing o bservation sentences convergently; thus (1 I. Anaphora,

clinching of cross-reference, continues to be its business also at more so­
phisticated levels, as in ( 2 ) . It is no coincidence that this is precisely the
business also of pronouns, or bound vari a bles. To be is to be the value of
a variable.
1 2 . Indifference of Ontology

Reference and ontology recede thus to the status of mere auxiliaries.
True sentences, observational and theoretical, are the alpha and omega
of the scientific enterprise. They a re related by structure, and obj ects fig­
ure as mere nodes of the structure. What particular obj ects there may be
is indifferent to the truth of o bservation sentences, indifferent to the sup­
port they lend to the theoretical sentences, indifferent to the success of
the theory in its predictions.
The point can be accentuated by invoking what I have called proxy
functions. A proxy function is a ny explicit one-to-one transformation, f,
defined over the obj ects in our purported universe. By 'explicit' I mean
that for any o bj ect x, specified in an acceptable notation, we can specify
fx . Suppose now we shift our ontology by reinterpreting each of our
predicates as true rather of the correlates fx of the obj ects x that it had
been true of. Thus, where 'Px' o riginally meant that x was a P, we rein­
terpret 'Px' as meaning that x is f of a P. Correspondingly for two-place
predicates and higher. Singular terms can be passed over in view of § 1 0 .
We leave a l l the sentences as they were, letter for letter, merely reinter­
preting. The o bservation sentences remain associated with the same sen­
sory stimulations as before, and the logical interconnections remain in­
tact. Yet the obj ects of the theory have been supplanted as drastically as
you please.s
Sometimes we can waive the requirement that the proxy function be
one to one. Thus consider G6del's numbering of expressions, in the
course of his proof of his famous incompleteness theorem. In one's
global theory of things it would be unnatural to say that the expres­
sions are identical with those numbers, but still there might be no call
to distinguish them. In that event a proxy function might j ust as well
treat them alike, assigning the same proxies to the expressions as to the
numbers.
However, one-to-one proxy functions were all I needed for my present

purpose, namely, to show the indifference of ontology. A more radical
case for the indifference of ontology is afforded by the Lowenheim­
Skolem theorem, in a strengthened form due to Hilbert and Bernays.6
When applied to a theory that has been fitted to predicate logic, cleared
of singular terms, and e ncompassed in a finite lot of axioms, this theo­
rem enables us to express a truth-preserving reinterpretation of the pred­
icates that makes the universe come to consist merely of natural numbers
0, 1, 2, . . . . This theorem does not, like proxy functions, carry each of
the old obj ects into a definite new one, a particular number. This was not
to be hoped for, since some infinite domains-notably that of the irratio­
nal numbers-are of too high a cardinality to be exhausted by correla­
tion with natural numbers. Despite this limitation, however, the reinter­
pretations leave all observation sentences associated with the same old
stimulations and all logical links undisturbed.
O nce we have appropriately regimented our system of the world or
part of it, we can so reinterpret it as to get by with only the slender ontol­
ogy of the whole numbers; such is the strengthened Lowenheim-Skolem
theorem. But we could not have arrived at our science in the first place
under that interpretation, since the numbers do not correspond one by
one to the reifications that were our stepping stones. Practically, heuristi­
cally, we must presumably pursue science in the old way or within the
reach, at least of proxy functions.
1 3 . Ontology Defused

We found that two ontologies, if explicitly correlated one to one, are em­
pirically on a par; there is no empirical ground for choosing the one
rather than the other. What is empirically significant in an ontology
is j ust its contribution of neutral nodes to the structure of the theory.
We could reinterpret 'Tabitha' as designating no longer the cat, but the
whole cosmos minus the cat; or, again, as designating the cat's singleton,
or unit class. Reinterpreting the rest of our terms for bodies in corre­
sponding fashion, we come out with an ontology interchangeable with
our familiar one. As wholes they are empirically indistinguishable. Bod­
ies still continue, under each interpretation, to be distinct from their cos­
mic complements and from their singletons; they are distinguished in a

Press, 1 9 8 2 ) , p p . 209-2 1 1 .

relativistic way, by their roles relative to one another and to the rest of
the ontology. Hence my watchword ontological relativity. But see fur­
ther § 2 0 .
T h e importance of t h e distinction between term and observation sen­
tence shone forth in § §3 and 9, and it does so again here. 'There's a rab­
bit' remains keyed to the sensory stimulations by which we learned it,
even if we reinterpret the term ' rabbit' as denoting cosmic complements
or singletons of rabbits. The term does continue to conjure up visions
appropriate to the observation sentence through which the term was
learned, and so be it; but there is no empirical bar to the reinterpretatio n .
T h e o riginal sensory associations w e r e indispensable genetically in gen­
erating the nodes by which we structure our theory of the world. But all
that matters by way of evidence for the theory is the stimulatory basis of
the observation sentences plus the structure that the neutral nodes serve
to implement. The stimulation remains as rabbity as ever, but the corre­
sponding node or obj ect goes neutral and is up for grabs.
Bodies were our primordial reifications, rooted in innate perceptua l
similarities. It would be gratuitous to swap them for proxies; t h e point
was j ust that one could. But our ontological preconceptions have a less
tenacious grip on the deliberate refinements of sophisticated science.
Physicists did first picture elementary particles and light waves in anal­
ogy to familiar things, but they have gone on to sap the analogies. The
particles are less and less like bodies, and the waves seem more like pul­
sations of energy in the void. When we get to the positing of num­
bers and other abstract obj ects, I have conj ectured in Roots of R eference
that we are indebted to some fruitful confusions along the way. Lan­
guage and science are rooted in what good scientific language eschews .
In Wittgenstein 's figure, we climb the ladder and kick it away.
Some findings known as the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics
suggest how we might be led actually to repudiate even the more tradi­
tional elementary particles as values of variables, rather than retaining
them and j ust acquiescing provisionally in their mysterious ways. Those
results seem to show that there is no difference even in principle between
saying of two elementary particles of a given kind that they are in the re­
spective places a and b and that they are oppositely placed, in b and a. It
would seem then not merely that elementary particles are unlike bodies;
it would seem that there are n o such denizens of space-time at all, and
that we should speak of pl aces a and b merely as being in certain states,
indeed the same state, rather than as being occupied by two things.

1 17

118

QUINTESSENCE

Perhaps physicists will accommodate this quandary in another way.
But I prize the example as illustrating the kind of consideration that
could prompt one to repudiate some hypothetical obj ects. The consider­
ation is not based on positivistic misgivings over theoretical entities. It is
based on tensions internal to theory.
Theories can take yet more drastic turns: such not merely as to
threaten a cherished ontology of elementary particles, but to threaten the
very sense of the ontological question, the question what there is. What I
have been taking as the standard idiom for existential purposes, namely
quantification, can serve as standard only when embedded in the stan­
dard form of regimented language that we have been picturing: one
whose further apparatus consists only of truth functions and predicates.
If there is any deviation in this further apparatus, then there arises a
question of foreign exchange : we cannot j udge what existential content
may be added by these foreign intrusions until we have settled on how to
translate it a ll into our standard form. Notoriously, in particular, quan­
tum mechanics invites logical deviations whose reduction to the old
standard is by no means evident. O n one rendering these deviations take
the form of probabilistic predications. On an alternative rendering they
call for basic departures from the logic of truth functions. When the dust
has settled, we may find that the very notion of existence, the old one,
has had its day. A kindred notion may then stand forth that seems suf­
ficiently akin to warrant application of the same word; such is the way of
terminology. Whether to say at that point that we have gained new in­
sight into existence, or that we have outgrown the notion and reapplied
the term, is a question of terminology as well.
The objectivity of our knowledge of the external world remains
rooted in our contact with the external world, hence in our neural intake
and the o bservation sentences that respond to it. We begin with the
monolithic sentence, not the term. A lesson of proxy functions is that
our ontology, like grammar, is part of our own conceptual contribution
to our theory of the world. Man proposes; the world disposes, but only
by holophrastic yes-or-no verdicts on the observation sentences that em­
body man's predictions.

7 . First Steps o f Radical Translation '

We have been reflecting in a general way an how surface irritations gen­
erate, through language, one's knowledge of the world. One is taught so
to associate words with words and other stimulations that there emerges
something recognizable as talk of things, and not to be distinguished
from truth about the world. The voluminous and intricately structured
talk that comes out bears little evident correspondence to the past and
present barrage of non-verbal stimulation; yet it is to such stimulation
that we must look for whatever empirical content there may be. In this
chapter we shall consider how much of language can be made sense of in
terms of its stimulus conditions, and what scope this leaves for empiri­
cally unconditioned variation in one's conceptual scheme.
A first uncritical way of picturing this scope for empirically uncondi­
tioned variation is as follows: two men could be j ust alike in all their dis­
positions to verbal behavior under all possible sensory stimulations, and
yet the meanings or ideas expressed in their identically triggered and
identically sounded utterances could diverge radically, for the two men,
in a wide range of cases. To put the matter thus invites, however, the
charge of meaninglessness: one may protest that a distinction of meaning
u nreflected in the totality of dispositions to verbal behavior is a distinc­
tion without a difference.
Sense can be made of the point by recasting it as follows: the infinite
totality of sentences of any given speaker's language can be so permuted,

or mapped onto itse l f, that (a) the totality of the speaker's dispositions to
verbal behavior remains i nvariant, and yet ( b ) the mapping is no mere
correlation of sentences with equivalent sentences, in any plausible sense
of eqUIvalence however loose. Sentences without number can diverge
dra,tically from their respective correlates, yet the divergences can sys­
tematically so o ffset one a nother that the overall pattern of associations
of ,entence, with one another and with non-verbal stimulation is pre­
served. The fi rmer the direct links of a sentence with non-verbal stimula­
tion, of course, the less that sentence can diverge from its correlate under
any such mapping.
The same point can be put less a bstractly and more realistically by
switching to translation. The thesis is then this: manuals for translating
one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compati­
ble with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one
another. In countless places they will diverge in giving, as their respective
translations of a sentence of the one language, sentences of the other lan­
guage which stand to each other in no pla usible sort of equivalence how­
ever loose. The firmer the direct links of a sentence with non-verbal stim­
ulation, of course, the less drastically its translations can diverge from
one another from manual to manual. It is in this last form, as a principle
of indeterminacy of translation, that I shall try to make the point plausi­
ble in the course of this chapter. But the chapter will run longer than i t
w o u l d if v a r i o u s of t h e concepts and considerations ancillary to this
theme did not seem worthy of treatment also on their own account.
We are concerned here with language as the complex of present dispo­
sitions to verbal behavior, in which speakers of the same language have
perforce come to resemble one another; not with the processes of acqui­
sition, whose variations from individual to individual it is to the interests
of communication to efface (cf. § 2 ) . The sentence 'That man shoots
wel l , ' said while pointing to an unarmed man, has as present stimulation
the glimpse of the marksman's familiar face. The contributory past stim­
ulation include, past observations of the man's shooting, as well as re­
mote episodes that trained the speaker in the use of the words. The past
stimulation i s th us commonly reckoned in part to the acquisition of lan­
guage and i n part to the acquisition of collateral information; however,
this subsidiary dichotomy can await some indication of what it is good
for and what general clues there are for it in observable verbal behavior.
( C f. § § 9, 1 2, 1 4 . ) Meanwhile what is before us is the going concern of
verbal behavior and its currently observable correlations with stimula-

tion . Reckon a man's current l a nguage by his cu rrent dispositions to re­
spond verbally to current stimulation, and you a utomatically refer a ll
past stimulation to the learning phase. Not but that even this way of
drawing a boundary between language in acquisition a n d language in
use has its fluctuations, inasmuch as we can consult our convenience in
what bound we set to the length of stimulations counted as current. This
bound, a working ,tandard of what to count as specious prescnt, I ca l l
the modulus of stimulation.
The recovery o f a man's current language from his currently o bserved
responses is the task of the linguist who, unaided by an interpreter, is out
to penetrate and translate a language hitherto unknown. All the objec­
tive data he has to go on are the forces that he sees impinging on the n a­
tive's surfaces and the observable behavior, vocal and otherwise, of the
native. Such data evince native " meanings" only of the most objectively
empirical or stimulus-linked variety. And yet the lingui,t apparently end,
up with native " meanings" i n some quite u n restricted sense; purported
translations, anyway, of a l l possible native sentences.
Translation between kindred languages, e . g . , Frisian and English, is
aided by resemblance o f cognate word forms. Translation between unre­
lated languages, e.g., Hungarian and English, may be aided by tradi­
tional equations that have evolved in step with a shared cu lture . What is
relevant rather to our purpose, is radical tran s l ation, i . e . , translation of
the language o f a hitherto untouched people. The task i, one that is not
in practice undertaken in its extreme form, since a chain of interpreters
of a sort can be recruited of marginal persons across the darkest archi­
pelago. But the problem is the more nearly approximated the poorer the
hints available from interpreters; thus attention to techniques of utterly
radical translation has not been wanting.' I shall imagine that all help of
interpreters is excluded. Incidentally I shall here ignore phonematic anal­
ysis ( § 1 8 ) , early though it would come i n Our field lingu ist's enterprise;
for it does not a ffect the philosophical point I want to make.
The utterances first and most s urely translated in such a case a re ones
keyed to present events that are conspicuous to thc linguist and his i n for­
mant. A rabbit scurries by, the native says 'Gavagai , ' and the linguist
notes down the sentence 'Rabbit' ( o r 'Lo, a rabbit') as tentative transla­
tion, subj ect to testing i n further cases. The linguist will at first refra i n

from putting words into his in formant's mouth, if only for lack of words
to put. When he can, though, the linguist has to supply native sentences
for his informant's approval, despite the risk of slanting the data by sug­
gestion. Otherwise he can do little with native terms that have references
in common. For, suppose the native language includes sentences S " S"
and S " really translatable respectively as 'Animal,' 'White,' and 'Rab­
bit.' Stimulus situations always differ, whether relevantly or not; and,
just because volunteered responses come singly, the classes of situations
under which the native happens to have vol unteered St, S" and S " are of
course mutually exclusive, despite the hidden actual meanings of the
words. How then is the linguist to perceive that the native would have
been willing to assent to SI in all the situations where he happened to
volunteer S " and in some but perhaps not all of the situations where he
happened to volunteer S,? On l y by taking the initiative and querying
combinations of native sentences and stimulus situations so as to n arrow
down his guesses to his eventual satisfaction.
So we have the linguist asking 'Gavaga i ? ' i n each of various stimu­
latory situations, and noting each time whether the native assents, dis­
sents, or neither. But how is he to recognize native assent a n d dissent
when he sees or hears them ? Gestures are not to be taken at face value;
the Turks' are nearly the reverse of our own. What he must do is guess
from observation and then see how well his guesses work. Thus suppose
that in asking 'Gavaga i ? ' and the like, in the conspicuous presence of
ra bbits a n d the like, he has elicited the responses ' Evet' and 'Yak' often
enough to surmise that they may correspond to 'Yes' and 'No , ' but has
no notion which is which. Then he tries the experiment of echoing the
native's own volunteered pronouncements. I f thereby he pretty regularly
elicits 'Evet' rather than 'Yak,' he is encouraged to take 'Evet' as ' Yes. '
Also he tries responding with 'Evet' a n d 'Yak' t o the native's remarks;
the one that is the more serene in its effect is the better candidate for
'Ye s . ' However inconclusive these methods, they generate a working hy­
pothesis. If extraordinary difficulties attend all his subsequent steps, the
linguist may decide to discard that hypothesis and guess again. '
Let us then suppose the linguist has settled on what to treat as native
signs of assent and dissent. He is thereupon in a position to accumulate
inductive evidence for translating 'Gavagai' as the sentence 'Rabbit. ' The

general law for which he is a;sembling instances I S roughly that the na­
tive will assent to 'Gavaga i ? ' under j ust those stimulations under which
we, if asked, would assent to 'Rabbit?'; and correspondingly for dissent.
But we can do somewhat more j ustice to what the linguist is after in
such a case if, instead of speaking merely of stimulations under which
the native will assent or dissent to the queried sentence, we speak in a
more causal vein of stimulations that will prompt the native to assent or
dissent to the queried sentence. For suppose the queried sentence were
one rather to the effect that someone is away tracking a giraffe. All
day long the native will assent to it whenever asked, under all manner of
irrelevant attendant stimulations; and on another day he will dissent
from it under the same irrelevant stimulations. It is important to know
that in the case of 'Gavagai ? ' the rabbit-presenting stimulations actually
prompt the assent, and that the others actually prompt the dissent.
In practice the linguist will usually settle these questions of causality,
however tentatively, by intuitive j udgment based on details of the na­
tive's behavior: his scanning movements, his sudden look of recognition,
and the like. Also there a re more formal considerati ons which, under fa­
vorable circumstances, can assure him of the prompting relation. If, j ust
after the native has been asked 5 and has assented or dissented, the lin­
guist springs stimulation a on him, asks S again, and gets the opposite
verdict, then he may conclude that a did the prompting.
Note that to prompt, in our sense, is not to elicit. What elicits the na­
tive's 'Evet' or 'Yok' is a combination: the prompting stimulation plus
the ensuing query 'Gavaga i ? ' .
8 . Stimulation a n d Stimu l u s Mea ning

It is important to think of what prompts the native's assent to ' Gavagai ? '
as stimulations and not rabbits. Stimulation c a n remain t h e same though
the rabbit be supplanted by a counterfeit. Converscly, stimulation can
vary in its power to prompt assent to 'Gavagai' because of variations in
angle, lighting, and color contrast, though the rabbit remains the same.
In experimentally equating the uses of ' Gavagai' and 'Ra bbit' it is stimu­
lations that must be made to match, not animals.
A visual stimulation is perhaps best identified, for present purposes,
with the pattern of chromatic irradiation o f the eye. To look deep into
the subject's head would be inappropriate even if feasible, for we want to
keep clear of his idiosyncratic neural routings or private history of ha bit

formation. We are after his socially inculcated linguistic usage, hence his
responses to conditions norma lly subject to social assessment. ( Cf. § 2 . )
Ocular irradiation is intersubj ectively checked t o some degree b y society
and linguist alike, by making allowances for the speaker's orientation
and the relative disposition of obj ects.
I n taking the visual stimulations as irradiation patterns we invest them
with a fineness of detail beyond anything that our linguist can be called
upon to check for. But this is all right. He can reasonably conjecture that
the native would be prompted to assent to 'Gavagai' by the microscopi­
cally same irradiations that would prompt him, the linguist, to assent to
'Rabbit,' even though this conjecture rests wholly on samples where the
irradiations concerned can at best be hazarded merely to be pretty much
alike.
It is not, however, adequate to think of the visual stimulations as mo­
mentary static irradiation patterns. To do so would obstruct examples
which, unlike 'Rabbit,' affirm movement. And it would make trouble
even with examples like 'Ra bbit,' on another account: too much depends
on what immediately precedes and follows a momentary irradiation. A
momentary lepiform image flashed by some artifice in the midst of an
otherwise rabbitless sequence might not prompt assent to 'Rabbit' even
though the same image would have done so if ensconced in a more fa­
vorable sequence. The difficulty would thus arise that far from hoping to
match the irradiation patterns favorable to 'Gavagai' with those favor­
able to 'Rabbit,' we could not even say unequivocally of an irradiation
pattern, of itself and without regard to those just before and after, that
it is favorable to 'Rabbit' or that it is not.4 Better, therefore, to take as
the relevant stimulations not momentary irradiation patterns, but evolv­
i ng irradiation patterns of all durations up to some convenient limit or
modulus. Furthermore we may think of the ideal experimental situation
as one in which the desired ocular exposure concerned is preceded and
followed by a b lindfold.
In general the ocular irradiation patterns are best conceived in their
spatial entirety. For there are examples such as 'Fine weather' which, un­
like 'Rabbit,' are not keyed to any readily segregated fragments of the
scene. Also there are all those rabbit-free patterns that are wanted as
prompting dissent from 'Rabbit.' And as for the patterns wanted as
prompting assent to 'Rabbit,' whole scenes will still serve better than se4 . Th" d I fficulty was talsed by [Donald] DavIdson.

lected portions might; for the difference between center and periphery,
which is such an important determinant of visual attention, is then auto­
matically allowed for. Total ocular irradiation patterns that differ in cen­
tering differ also in limits, and so are simply different patterns. One that
shows the rabbit too peripherally simply will not be one that prompts as­
sent to 'Gavagai' or 'Rabbit.'
Certain sentences of the type of 'Gavagai' are the sentences with
which our j ungle linguist must begin, and for these we now have before
us the makings of a crude concept of empirical meaning. For meaning,
supposedly, is what a sentence shares with its translation; and transla­
tion at the present stage turns solely on correlations with non-verhal
stimulation.
Let us make this concept of meaning more explicit and give it a neu­
trally technical name. We may begin by defining the affirmative stimulus
meaning of a sentence such as 'Gavagai,' for a given spea ker, as the class
of all the stimulations ( hence evolving ocular irradiation patterns be­
tween properly timed blindfoldings) that would prompt his assent. More
explicitly, in view of the end of § 7, a stimulation a helongs to the af­
firmative stimulus meaning of a sentence S for a given speaker if and
only if there is a stimulation (J ' such that if the speaker were given (J ' ,
then were asked S, then were given (J, and then were asked S again, he
would dissent the first time and assent the second. We may define the
negative stimulus meaning similarly with 'assent' and 'dissent' inter­
changed, and then define the stimulus meanl11g as the ordered pair of the
two . We could refine the notion of stimulus meaning by distinguishing
degrees of doubtfulness of assent and dissent, say by reaction time; hut
for the sake of fluent exposition let us forbear. The i magined equating of
'Gavagai' and 'Rabhit' can now he stated thus: they have the same stim­
ulus meaning.
A stimulus meaning is the stimulus meaning of a sentence for a
speaker at a date; for we must allow our speaker to change his ways.
Also it varies with the modulus, or maximum duration recognized for
stimulations. For, by increasing the modulus we supplement the stimulus
meaning with some stimulations that were too long to count before.
Fully ticketed, therefore, a stimulus meaning is the stimulus meaning
modulo n seconds of sentence S for speaker a at time t.
The stimulations to be gathered into the stimulus meaning of a sen­
tence have for vividness been thought of thus far as visual, unlike the
queries that follow them. Actually, of course, we should bring the other

125

126

Q U I N T E S � I N C: E

senses in on a par with vision, identifying stimulations not with j ust ocu­
lar irradiation patterns but with these and the various barrages of other
senses, separately and in all synchronous combinations. Perhaps we can
pass over the detail o f this.
The a ffirmative and negative stimulus meanings o f a sentence ( for a
given speaker at a given time) are mutually exclusive. Granted, our sub­
j ect might be prompted once by a given stimulation a to assent to S, and
later, bv a recurrence of 0, to dissent from S; but then we would simply
conclude that his meaning for S had changed. We would then reckon a to
his a ffirmative stimu l u s meaning of S as of the one date and to his nega­
tive stimulus meaning o f S as o f the other date.
Yet the affirmative and negative stimulus meanings do not determine
each other; for many stimulations may be expected to belong to neither.
In general, therefore, comparison of whole stimul u s meanings can be a
better basis for translations than comparison merely of affirmative stim­
ulus meanings.
What now of that strong conditional, the 'wou ld' in our definition of
stimulus meaning? Its use here is no worse than its use when we explain
'x is soluble i n water' as meaning that x would dissolve if it were in wa­
ter. What the strong conditional defines is a disposition, in this case a dis­
position to assent to or dissent from S when variously stimulated. The
disposition may be pres umed to be some subtle structural condition, like
an allergy and like solu bility; like an allergy, more particularly, in not be­
ing understood. The ontological status o f dispositions, or the philosoph­
ical status of talk of dispositions, is a matter which I defer to §46; but
meanwhile we are familiar enough in a general way with how one sets
a bout guessing, from j u d icious tests and samples and observed uniformi­
ties, whether there is a disposition o f a specified sort.
The stimulus meaning o f a sentence for a subject sums up his disposi­
tion to assent to or dissent from the sentence in response to present stim­
ulation. The stimulation is what activates the disposition, as opposed to
what instills it ( even though the stimulation chance to contribute some­
how to the instilling of some further disposition ) .
Yet a stimulation must b e conceived for these purposes n o t as a dated
particular event but as a universal, a repeatable event form. We are to
sav not that two like stimulations have occurred, but that the same stim­
ulation has recurred . Such an attitude is implied the moment we speak of
sameness of stimulus meaning for two speakers. We could indeed over­
ru le this consideration, if we liked, by readj usting our terminology. But

1

there would be no point, for there remains elsewhere a compelling rea­
son for taking the stimulations as universals; viz., the strong conditional
in the definition o f stimulus meaning. For, consider again the affirmative
stimulus meaning o f a sentence S: the class L of all those stimulations
that wuuld prompt assent to S. I f the stimulations were taken as events
rather than event forms, then L would have to he a class of events which
largely did not and will not happen, but which would prompt assent to oS
if they were to happen. Whenever L contained one realized or unrealized
particular stimulatorv event a, it would have to contain all other unreal­
ized duplicates of a; and how many a rc there of these? Certainly it is
hopele" nonsense to talk thus of unrealized particulars and try to assem­
ble them into classes. Unrealized entities have to be construed as uni­
versals.
We were impressed in §3 with the interdependence of sentences. We
may well have begun then to wonder whether meanings even of whole
sentences ( let alone shorter expressions) could reasonably be talked o f at
all, except relative to the other sentences of an inclusi ve theorv. Such rel­
ativity would be awkward, since, conversely, the i ndividual component
sentences offer the only way into the theory. Now the notion o f stimulus
meaning partially resolves the predicament. It isolates a sort of net em­
pirical import of each of various single sentences without regard to the
containing theory, even though without loss of what the sentence owes
to that contain ing theory. It is a device, as far as it goes, for exploring the
fa bric of interlocking sentences, a sentence at a time.
Between the notion of stimulus meaning and Carnap's remarks on
empirical semantics' there arc connections and differences worth not­
ing. lIe suggests exploring the meaning of a term by asking the subject
whether he would apply it under various i maginary circumstances, to be
descrihed to him. That approach has the virtue of preserving contrasts
between sllch terms as 'goblin' and 'unicorn' despite the non-existence of
contrasting instances in the world. Stimulus meaning has the same vir­
tue, since there are stimulation patterns that would prompt assent to
'Unicorn ? ' and not to 'Goblin ? ' . Carna p's approach presupposes some
decision as to what descriptions of imaginary ci rcumstances are adm issi­
ble; e.g., 'unicorn' would be not wanted in descriptions used in probing
the meaning of 'unicorn . ' He hints of appropriate restricti ons for the

pu rposc� mentioning " size, shape, colo r " ; and my notion of stimulus
meaning itself amounts to < 1 firmer definition in that same direction.
There remains a significant contrast in the uses the two of us make of
subj unctive conditionals: I lim i t them to my investigator's considered
judgment o f what the informant would do if stimulated; Canup has his
investigator p utting such conditionals to the j u dgment of the informant.
Certainly my investigator would in practice ask the same questions as
Carnap's investigator, as a quick way of estimating stimulus meanings,
if language for such questions happened to be available. But stimulus
meaning can be explored also at the first stages o f radical translation,
where Carnap's type of questionnaire is unavailable. On this score it is
important, as we shall see in § 1 2, that mv theory has to do primarily
with sentences of a sort and not, like Carnap's, with terms.
9 . Occasion Sentences. Intrusive Information

()ccasioll sentences, as against standing sentences, are sentences such as
' Gavagai,' 'Red,' 'It hurts,' 'llis face is dirty, ' which command assent
or dissent only if queried a fter an appropriate prompting stimulation.
Verdicts to standing sentences can be prompted too: stimulation imple­
mented by an interferometer once prompted Michelson and Morley to
dissent from the standing sentence 'There is ether drift,' and a speaker's
assent can be prompted yearly to 'The crocuses are out,' daily to " rhe
Times has come . ' But these stClI1ding sentences contrast with occasion
sentences in that the su bject may repeat his old assent or dissent u n­
prompted by current stimulation when we ask him again on later occa­
sions, whereas an occasion sentence commands assent or dissent only
as pmmpted all over again by cu rrent stimulation. Standing sentences
grade off toward occasion sentences as the interval between possible
repromptings diminishes; and the occasion sentence is the extreme case
where that interval is less th an the modulus. Like the stimulus meanings
themselves, the distinction between standing sentences and occasion sen­
tences is relative to the 111 0 dulus; an occasion sentence l11odulo 11 seconds
can be a standing sentence modulo 11
l.
The stimulations belonging to neither the affirmative nor the negative
stimulus meaning of an occasion sentence are j ust those that would in­
h ibit a verdict on the queried sentence, whether through in decisiveness
(as i n the case of a poor glimpse) or through shocking the subj ect out of
his wits. On the other hand the stimulations belonging to neither the af�

Tra nslation a n d �/leanll1g

firmative nor the negative stimulus meaning of a standing sentence are of
two sorts: besides the inhibitory ones there are the Irrelevant ones, which
neither prompt nor inhibit. Querying the sentence on the heels of such a
stimulation would elicit a verdict, but al ways the one that the query
would have elicited without the attendant stimulation; never a change of
verdict.
The stimulus meaning is a full cross-section of the subj ect's evolving
dispositions to assent to or dissent from a sentence, if the sentence is
a n occasion sentence; less so if it is a standing sentence. Standing sen­
tences can differ among themselves in " meaning, " by any intuitive ac­
count," as freely as occasion sentences; but, the less susceptible they a re
to prompted assent and dissent, the fewer elues are present in sti mulus
meaning. The notion of stimulus meaning is th us most i mportant for oc­
casion sentences, and we shall limit our attention for a while to them.
Even for such favored occasion sentences as 'Gavagai' and 'Rabbit:
actually, sameness of stimulus meaning has its shortcomings as a synon­
ymy relation. The difficulty is that an informant's assent to or dissent
from 'Gavagai ? ' can depend excessively on prior collateral information
as a supplement to the present prompting stimulus. He may assent on
the occasion of nothing better than an ill -gl impsed movement in the
grass, hecause of his earlier observation, unknown to the linguist, of rab­
bits near the spot. Since the linguist would not on his own information
be prompted by that same poor glimpse to assent to 'Rabbit ? ' , w e have
here a discrepancy between the present stimu lus meaning of 'Gavagai'
for the informant and that of 'Rabbit' for the l inguist.
More persistent discrepancies of the same type can be imagined, af­
fecting not one native but all, and not once but regularly. There may be a
local rabbit-fly,' unknown to the linguist, and recognizable some way o ff
by its long wings and erratic movements; and seeing such a fly in the
neighborhood of an ill-glimpsed animal could help a native to recog­
nize the latter as a rabbit. Ocular irradiations combining poor gl impses
of rabbits with good ones of rabbit-flies would belong to the stimulus
meaning of 'Gavagai' for natives generally, and not to that of 'Rabbit'
for the linguist.

Q u r "' T E S S E N C E

And, to be less fanciful, there are all those stimulations that incorpo­
rate verbal hints from native kibitzers. Thus suppose that the stimulation
on the heels of which the informant is asked 'Gavaga i ? ' is a compos­
ite stimulation presenting a bystander pointing to an ill-glimpsed ob­
j ect and saying 'Gavaga i . ' This composite stimulation will probably turn
o ut to belong to the affirmative stimulus meaning of 'Gavagai' for the
informant, and not to the stimulus meaning of 'Rabbit' for most Eng­
lish speakers, on whom the force of the hystander's verbal intervention
would be lost. Such cases would not fool our linguist, but they do count
against defining synonymy as sameness of stimulus meaning. For we
must remember that every sufficiently brief stimulation pattern, though
it be one that never gets actualized or that the linguist would never use,
still by definition belongs to the stimulus meaning of 'Gavagai' for a man
at a given time if it is one that would prompt his assent at that time.
Intuitively the ideal would be to accord to the affirmative meaning
of 'Gavagai' j ust those stimulations that would prompt assent to
'Gavaga i ? ' on the strength purely of an understanding of 'Gavagai,' un­
aided by collateral information: unaided by recent observation of rabbits
near the spot, unaided by knowledge of the nature and habits of the rab­
bit-fly, unaided by conversance with the kibitzer's language. O n the face
of it there is a difficulty in excluding this third aid, considering our con­
tinuing dependence on the subj ect's understanding of 'Gavagai . ' But also
the trouble is more widespread. It is precisely that we have made no gen­
eral experimental sense of a distinction between what goes into a native's
learning to apply an expression and what goes into his learning sup­
plementary matters about the ohj ects concerned. True, the linguist can
press such a distinction part way; he can filter out such idiosyncratic bits
of collateral matter as the informant's recent observation of rabbits near
the spot, by varying his times and his informants and so isolating a more
stable and more social stimulus meaning as common denominator. But
any socially shared information, such as that about the rabbit-fly or the
ability to understand a bystander'S remark, will continue to affect even
that common denominator. There is no evident criterion whereby to
strip such effects away and leave j ust the meaning of 'Gavagai' properly
so-called-whatever meaning properly so-called may be.
Thus, to depict the difficu l ty in more general terms, suppose it said
that a particular class L comprises j ust those stimulations each of which
suffices to prompt assent to a sentence S outright, without benefit of col­
lateral information. Suppose it said that the stimulations comprised in a

Tra nslation a n d Meaning

further class �', likewise sufficient to prompt assent ro S, owe their
efficacy rather to certain widely dissemin ated collateral information, C.
Now couldn't we just as well have said, instead, that on acquiring C,
men have found it convenient implicitly ro change the very " meaning" of
S, so that the members of � ' now suffice outright like members of �? I
suggest that we may say either; even historical clairvoyance would reveal
no distinction, though it reveal all stages in the acquisition of C, since
meaning can evolve pari passu. The distinction is illusory: as mistaken
as the notion, scouted in §4, that we can determine separately what to
talk about and what to say about it. It is simply a question whether to
call the transitivity shortcuts ( § 3 ) changes of meaning or condensations
of proof; and in fact a n unreal question. What we obj ectively have is j ust
an evolving adj ustment to nature, reflected in an evolving set of disposi­
tions to be prompted by stimulations to assent to or dissent from sen­
tences. These dispositions may be conceded to be impure in the sense of
including worldly knowledge, but they contain it in a solution which
there is no p recipitating.
Incidentally, note that stimulus meanings as defined in § 8 can even
suffer some discrepancies that are intuitively attributable neither to d i f­
ferences of meaning nor to differences of collateral information. Thus
take shocked silence. To begin with, if the speaker is already stunned at
time t, all stimulus meanings for him at t will be empty. This outcome o f
t h e definition o f stimulus meaning is unnatural b u t harmless, since w e
c a n ignore stimulus meanings f o r stunned persons. But in the case o f a
speaker alert at t there are stimulations that would stun him at t and so
would preclude any assent to or dissent from the ensuing 'Gavaga i ? ' .
These, by definition, belong to neither the a ffirmative nor the negative
stimulus meaning of 'Gavaga i ' for him at t. Now where a discrepancy in
stimulus meanings will ensue is where a stimulation is such as woul d
stun one speaker and not another; fo r it could belong say to the negative
stimulus meaning of ' Gavagai' or 'Rabbit' for the latter speaker and to
neither the a ffirmative nor the negative stimulus meaning for the former
speaker. This again is a discrepancy that would not puzzle the linguist,
but that exists under our definition. Also there are interferences o f b,s
drastic sorts. The native may dissent from 'Gavagai' in plain sight of the
rabbit's cars, because the rabbit is in no position for shooting;" he has
misj udged the linguist's motive for asking ' Gavaga i ? ' .

Q U I NTESSEN C E

We have now seen that stimulus meaning as defined falls short in vari­
ous ways of one's intuitive demands on " meaning" as undefined, and
that sameness of stimulus meaning is too strict a relation to expect be­
tween a native occasion sentence and its translation-even in so benign
a case as 'Gavaga i' and 'Rabbit.' Yet stimulus meaning, by whatever
name, may be properly looked upon still as the obj ective reality that the
linguist has to probe when he undertakes radical translation. For the
stimulus meaning of an occasion sentence is by definition the native's to­
tal battery of present dispositions to b e prompted to assent to or to dis­
sent fro m the sentence; and these dispositions are j ust what the linguist
has to sample and estimate. We do best to revise not the notion of stimu­
lus meaning, but only what we represent the linguist as doing with stim­
ulus meanings. The fact is that he translates not by identity of stimulus
meanings, but by significant approximation of stimulus meanings.
If he translates 'Gavagai' as 'Rabbit' despite the discrepancies in stim­
ulus meaning imagined above, he does so because the stimulus meanings
seem to coincide to an overwhelming degree and the discrepancies, so far
as he finds them, seem best explained away or dismissed as effects of
unidentified interferences. Some discrepancies he may sift out, as lately
suggested, by varying his times and informants. Some, involving poor
glimpses or shock or verbal intrusions, he would not even bother to
bring to fulfillment by a querying of the sentence . Some, such as those in­
volving the rabbit-fly, he will dismiss as effects of unidentified interfer­
ences if he does not encounter them often. In taking this last rather high
line, clearly he is much influenced by his natural expectation that any
people in rabbit country would have some brief expression that could in
the long run be best translated simply as 'Rabbit.' He conjectures that
the now-unexplained discrepancies between 'Gavagai' and 'Rabbit' are
o n es that may eventually be reconciled with his translation, after he has
somehow got deep enough into the native language to ask sophisticated
questions.
In practice, of course, the natutal expectation that the natives will
have a brief expression for 'Rabbit' counts overwhelmingly. The linguist
hears ' Gavagai' once, in a situation where a rabbit seems to be the object
of concern. He will then try 'Gavagai' for assent or dissent in a couple
of situations designed perhaps to eliminate 'White ' and 'Animal' as alter­
native translations, and will forthwith settle upon 'Rabbit' as transla­
tion without further experiment-though always in readiness to dis­
cover through some unsought experience that a revision is in order. I

Tra nslation a n d M e a n mg

made the linguist preternaturally circumspect, and maximized his bad
luck in respect o f discrepant observations, in order to consider what the­
oretical bearing a native's collateral information can have upon the lin­
guist's in fact wholly facile opening translation.
1 0 . O b servation Sentences

Some stimulus meanings are less susceptible than others to the influences
of intrusive information. There is on this score a significant contrast be­
tween 'Red' and 'Rabbit' even when 'Red' is taken on a par with 'Rab­
bit' as announcing not a passing sense datum but an enduring obj ective
trait of the physical object. True, there are extreme cases where we may
be persuaded, by collateral information about odd lighting and j uxtapo­
sition, that something is rea lly red that did not seem so o r vice versa; but,
despite such cases, there is less scope for collateral information in decid­
ing whether a glimpsed thing is red than in deciding whether it is a rab­
bit. I n the case of 'Red,' therefore, sameness of stimulus meaning comes
unusually close to what one intuitively expects of synonymy.
Color words are notoriously ill matched between remote languages,
because of di fference; in customary grouping of shades. But this is no
present problem; it means merely that there may well be no native occa­
sion sentence, at least no reasonably simple one, with approximately the
stimulus meaning of 'Red . ' Again, even if there is one, there may still
be a kind of trouble in equating it to 'Red,' j ust because of the vagueness
of color boundaries in both languages. But this again is no problem of
collateral information; it is a difficulty that would remain even if a dis­
tinction between meaning and collateral information were successfu lly
drawn. It can be coped with by a rough matching o f statistical scat­
terings. The penumbra of vagueness of 'Red' consists of stimulations
in respect of which the stimulus meanings of 'Red' tend to vary from
speaker to speaker and from occasion to occasion; correspondingly for
the penumbra of vagueness of the native sentence; and then 'Red' is a
good translation to the extent that it resembles the native sentence um­
bra for umbra and penumbra for penumbra.
In terms of direct behavioral evidence, how do those fluctuations of
stimulus meaning that are attributable to a penumbra of vagueness differ
from those fluctuations of stimulus meaning (e.g. of ' Gavaga i ' ) that are
laid to variations of collateral information from occasion to occasion?
Partly in that the penumbral fluctuations increase rather smoothly as the

1 33

134

QUINTESSENCE

stimulations grade off, while the fluctuations laid to collatera l informa­
tion are more irregular, suggesting intrusion o f extraneous factors. But
mainly in that each individual's assent or dissent tends to be marked by
doubt and hesitation when the prompting stimulation belongs to the
penumbra. If we were to complicate the notion of stimulus meaning to
the extent of weighting each stimulation inversely according to reaction
time (ef. § 8 ) , then discrepancies in stimulus meaning from speaker to
speaker would tend to count for little where due to vagueness, and for
more where not.
H 'Red' is somewhat less susceptible than 'Ra bbit' to the influences of
intrusive information, there are other sentences that are vastly more so.
An example is 'Bachelor. ' An informant's assent to it is prompted genu­
inely enough by the sight of a face, yet it draws mainly on stored i nfor­
mation and none on the prompting stim ulation except as needed for rec­
ognizing the bachelor friend concerned . As one says in the uncritical
j argon of meaning, the trouble with 'Bachelor' is that its meaning tran­
scends the looks of the prompting faces and concerns matters that can
be known only through other channels. 'Ra bbit' is a little this way, as
witness papier-mache counterfeits; 'Bachelor' much more so. The stimu­
lus meaning of 'Bachelor' cannot be treated as its " meaning" by any
stretch of the imagination, unless perhaps accompanied by a stretch of
the modulus.
A mark of the intrusion of collateral information, except when the in­
formation is generally shared as in the exa mples of the kibitzer and the
rabbit-fly ( § 9 ) , was discrepancy in stimulus meaning from speaker to
speaker of the same language. In a case like 'Bachelor,' therefore, we may
expect the discrepancies to be overwhelming; and indeed they are. For
any two speakers whose social contacts are not virtually identical, the
stimulus meanings of 'Bachelor' will diverge far more than those of
'Rabbit.'
The less susceptible the stimulus meaning of an occasion sentence is to
the influences of collateral information, the less absurdity there is in
thinking of the stimulus meaning of the sentence as the meaning of the
sentence . Occasion sentences whose stimulus meanings vary none under
the influence of collateral information may naturally be called ob se rva­
tion sentences, and their stimulus meanings may without fear of contra­
diction be said to do fu ll j ustice to their meanings. These are the occasion
sentences that wear their meanings on their sleeves. Or, better, we may
speak of degrees of observationality; for even the stimulus meaning of

Tra nslation ilnd .�vle<l n Jng

'Red' can, we noted, be made to fluctuate a little from occasion to occa­
sioo by collateral information on lighting conditions. What we have is a
gradation of observationality from one extreme, at 'Red' or above, to
the other extreme at 'Bachelor' or below.
In the foregoing paragraph we have wa llowed most unfastidiously in
the conceptual slough of meaning and collateral i n formation. But now it
is interesting to note that what we have dredged out, a notion of degree
of observationality, is not beyond cleaning up and rendering respectable.
For, i n behavioral terms, an occasion sentence may be said to be the
more observational the more nearly its stimulus meanings for different
speakers tend to coincide. Granted, tbis definition fails to give demerit
marks for the effects of generally shared information, such as that about
the rabbit-Ily. But, as argued in § 9 , I suspect that no systematic experi­
mental sense is to be made of a distinction between usage due to mean­
ing and usage due to generally shared collateral information.
The notion of observationality is relative to the modulus of stimula­
tion. This is not to be wondered at, since the notion of stimu l u s meaning
was relative to the modulus ( d. § 8 ) , and so is the very distinction be­
tween habit formation and habit formed ( d. § 7 ) . Observati onality in­
creases with the modulus, in the following wav. A typical case of discrep­
ancy between the stimulus meanings of ' Gavagai: for two natives, is the
case where one native and not the other has lately seen rahbits near the
spot that they are now viewing. An ill-glimpsed movement would now
prompt the one native and not the other to assent to ' Cavagai ? ' . B u t i f
w e m a k e t h e modulus long enough to include as part of t h e o n e native's
present stimulation his recent observation of rabbits ncar the spot, then
what had been a discrepancy between stimulus meanings is a mere dif­
ference of stimulations: the one stimulation is such as would prompt ei­
ther native to assent, and the other neither. Increase the modulus suf­
ficiently to take in extended periods of learning about friends and you
even increase the observationality of 'Bachelor. ' B u t let us forget moduli
again for a while, thus keeping our variables down.
We have defined observationality for occasion sentences somewhat
vagucly, as degree of constancy of stimulus meaning from speaker to
speaker. It would not do to use this definition gencr.l l l y among stand­
ing sentences, since the stimulus meaning of a standing sentence can
show fair constancy from speaker to speaker for the wrong reason: mere
sparseness of member stimulations. Among standing sentences that are
well over toward the occasion end ( d. § 9 ) , however, the notion of ohser-

135

136

Q UINTESSENCE

vationality works quite as well as among occasion sentences, and is sig­
nificant in the same way; viz., the higher the ooservationality, the better
we can get on with translation by stimulus meaning. We could hope,
e.g., to translate 'The tide is out' oy a rough matching of stimulus mean­
ings; not so 'There is a famous novelist on board. '
Viewing the graded notion of observationality as the primary one, we
may sti l l speak of sentences simply as observation sentences when they
are high in observationality. In a narrow sense, j ust 'Red' would qualify;
in a wider sense, also 'Rabbit' and 'The tide is out.' I t is for observation
sentences in some such sense that the notion of stimulus meaning consti­
tutes a reasona hIe notion o f meaning.
To philosophers 'observation sentence' suggests the datum sentences
of science. O n this score our version is not amiss; for the observation
sentences as we have identified them are j ust the occasion sentences on
which there is pretty sure to be firm agreement on the part of well-placed
observers. Thus they are j ust the sentences on which a scientist will tend
to fall back when pressed by doubting colleagues. Moreover, the philo­
sophical doctrine of infallibility of observation sentences is su stained un­
der our version. For there is scope for error and dispute only insofar as
the connections with experience whereby sentences are appraised are
multifa rious and indirect, mediated through time by theory in conflicting
ways; there is none insofar as verdicts to a sentence are directly keyed to
present stimulation. (This immunity to error is, however, like ohserva­
tionality itself, for us a matter of degree. ) Our version of observation
sentences departs from a philosophical tradition in allowing the sen­
tences to be ahout ordinary things instead of requi ring them to report
sense data, but this departure has not lacked proponents .'
In estimating the stimulus meaning of a sentence for a speaker at a
given time, the linguist is helped by varying the time and speaker. Tn
choosing a translation, he is helped by comparing native speakers and so
eliminating idiosyncrasies of stimulus meaning. Still the notion of stimu­
lus meaning itself, as defined, depends on no multiplicity of speakers.
Now the notion of observationality, in contrast, is social. The behavioral

Translation and Meaning

definition offered for it above turns on similarities of stimulus meanings
over the commun ity.
What makes an occasion sentence low on observationality is, by defi­
nition, wide intersubjective variability of stimulus meaning. Language
as a socially inculcated set of dispositions is substantially uniform over
the community, but it is uniform in different ways for different sen­
tences. If a sentence is one that ( like 'Red' and 'Rabbit') is inculcated
mostly by something like direct ostension, the uniformity will lie at the
surface and there will be little variation in stimulus meaning; the sen­
tence will be highly observational. If it is one that ( like 'Bachelor ' ) is in­
culcated through connections with other sentences, linking up thus indi­
rectlv with past stimulations of other sorts than those that serve directly
to prompt present assent to the sentence, then its stimulus meaning will
vary with the speakers' pasts, and the sentence will count as very unob­
servational. The stimulus meaning of a very unobservational occasion
sentence for a speaker is a product of two factors, a fairly standard set of
sentence-to-sentence connections and a random personal history; hence
the largely random character of the stimulus meaning from speaker to
speaker.
Now this random c haracter has the effect not only that the stimulus
meaning of the sentence for one speaker will differ from the stimulus
meaning of that sentence for other speakers. It will differ from the stimu­
lus meaning also of any other discoverable sentence for other speakers,
in the same language or any other. Granted, a great complex English sen­
tence can be imagined whose stimulus meaning for one man matches, by
sheer exhaustion of cases, another man's stimulus meaning of 'Bachelor';
but such a sentence would never be spotted, because nobody's stimulus
meaning of 'Bachelor' would ever be suitably inventoried to begin with.
For, consider again how it was with 'Gavaga i . ' Here the stimulations
belonging to the affirmative stimulus meaning share a distinctive trait
that is salient, to us as well as to the native: the containing of rabbit
glimpses. The trait is salient enough so that the linguist generalizes on it
from samples: he expects the next glimpse of a rabbit to prompt assent
to 'Gavagai' as past ones have. His generalization is repeatedly borne
out, and h e concludes with his conj ecture that the native's whole stimu­
lus meaning of 'Gavagai'-never experimenta lly exhausted, of course­
will tend to match ours of 'Rabbit.' Now a similar effort with a non-ob­
servational native occasion sentence, of the type of our 'Bachelor, ' would
have bogged down in its early stages. Sample stimulations belonging to

1.l7

1 38

the affirmative stimulus meaning of such a sentence, for the given native,
would show no tempting common traits by which to conj ecture further
cases, or none but such as fail to hold up on further tries.
1 1 . Intra s u b j ective Synonymy of Occasion Sentences

Stimulus meaning remains defined without regard to ohservationality.
But when applied to non-observational sentences like 'Bachelor' it bears
little resemblance to what might reasonably be called meaning. Transla­
tion of 'Soltero' as ' Bachelor' manifestly cannot be predicated on iden­
tity of stimulus meanings between speakers; nor can synonymy of 'Bach­
elor' and 'Unmarried man.'
But curiou sly enough the stimulus meanings of 'Bachelor' and 'Un­
married man' are, despite all this, identical for any one speaker. 1 0 An in­
dividual would at any one time be prompted by the same stimulations to
assent to 'Bachelor' and 'Unmarried man'; and similarly for dissent.
Stimulus synonymy, or sameness of stimulus meaning, is as good a stan­
dard of synonymy for non-observational occasion sentences as for ob­
servation sentences as long as we stick to one speaker. For each speaker,
'Bachelor' and 'Unmarried man' are stimulus-synonymous without hav­
ing the same meaning in any acceptably defined sense of 'meaning' ( for
stimulus meaning is, in the case of 'Bachelor,' nothing of the kind ) . Very
well; here is a case where we may welcome the synonymy and let the
111 e aning go.
'rhe one-speaker restriction p resents no obstacle to saying that 'Bache­
lor' and 'Unmarried man' arc stimulus-synonymous for the whole com­
munity, in the sense of being thus for each member. A practical extension
even to the two-language case is not far to seek if a bilingual speaker is at
hand. 'Bachelor' and 'Soltero' will be stimulus-synonymous for him.
Taking him as a sample, we may treat 'Bachelor' and 'Soltero' as synony­
mous for the translation purposes of the two whole linguistic communi­
ties that he represents. Whether he is a good enough sample would be
1 0. It em he argued that this mlH.:h-u�l'd example of synonymy has ccrtam imper­
fectIOns h,lvmg to do With ages, dIvorce, and hachetofs of arts. Another example

and 'IlI�ltcrn,ll gr<-lndfather' (poetic connotatIOns not belTlg here ITl point), or 'wldo\\7er'
and 'man who (o�t IllS Wife.' However, W ith thiS much by way of caveat against qUlh­
bllOg, perhaps we can keep to our convennonal example and overlook d lvagatlolb.

checked hy o bserving the fluency of his communication in hoth commu­
nities and by comparing other bilinguals.
Section 10 left the linguist unable to guess the trend of the stimulus
meaning of a non-observational occasion sentence from sample cases.
We now see a way, though costly, in which h e can still accomplish radical
translation of such sentences. He can settle down and learn the native
language di rectly as an infant might. Having thus become bilingual, he
can translate the non-o bservational occasion sentences by introspected
stimulus synonymy.
This step has the notable effect of initiating clear recognition of native
falsehoods. As long as the linguist does no more than correlate the na­
tive's observation sentences with his own by stimulus meaning, he can­
not discount any of the native's verdicts as false-unless ad hoc, most
restra ined ly, to simplify his correlations. But once he becomes bilingual
and so transcends the observation sentences, he can bicker with the na­
tive as a brother.
Even short of going bilingual there is no difficulty in comparing two
non-o bservation a l native sentences to see if they are intrasubjectively
stimulus-synonymous for the native. The linguist can do this without
having intuitively conjectured the trend of stimulus meaning of either
sentence. He need merely query the sentences in parallel under random
stimulations until he either h i ts a stimulation that prompts assent or dis­
sent to one sentence a n d not to the other, or else is satisfied at last that
he is not going to. A visiting Martian who never learns under what
circumstances to apply 'Bachelor,' or 'Unmarried man' either, can still
find out by the a bove method that 'Bachelor' for one English speaker
does not have the same stimulus meaning as 'Bachelor' for a different
English speaker and that it has the same as 'Unmarried man' for the
same speaker. He can, anyway, apart from one difficulty: there is no evi­
dent reason why it should occur to him thus blindly to try comparing
'Unmarried man' with 'Bachelor. ' This difficulty makes the intrasub­
jective stimulus synonymy of non-observational occasion sentences less
readily accessible to an alien linguist than the stimulus synonymy of ob­
servation sentences such as 'Gavaga i ' and 'Rabbit . ' Still the linguist can
examine for intrasubj ective stimulus synonymy any pair of native occa­
sion sentences that it occurs to him to wonder about; and we shall see in
§ 1 5 how indirect considerations can even suggest such pairs for exami­
nation.
Between the stimulus meaning of any sentence for o n e man and the

139

140

QUINTESSENCE

stimulus meaning of the same or any other sentence for another man
there are almost bound to be countless discrepancies in point of verbally
contaminated stimulations, as long as one man understands a language
that the other does not. The argument is that of the ki bitzer case in § 9 .
The translating linguist h a d for this reason t o discount verbally contam­
inated discrepancies. But intrasubj ective comparisons are free of this
trouble. Intrasubj ectively we can even compare the occasion sentences
'Yes,' 'Uh huh,' and 'Quite' for stimulus synonymy, though the stimula­
tions that enter into the stimulus meanings of these sentences are purely
verbal in their relevant portions. A further advantage of the intrasub­
j ective situation appears in the case of stimulations that would at a given
time shock one speaker and not another into silence ( d. § 9 ) ; for clearly
these will constitute no discrepancies intrasubjectively. Altogether the
equating of stimulus meanings works out far better intrasubj ectively
than between subj ects: it goes beyond observation sentences, it absorbs
shock, and it better accommodates verbal stimulations.
Verbal stimulations can plague even the intrasubj ective comparisons
when they are stimulations of " second i ntention"-i . e . , when besides
consisting of words they are about words. Second-intention examples
are the bane of theoretical linguistics, also apart from synonymy studies.
Thus take the linguist engaged in distinguishing between those sequences
of sounds or phonemes that can occur in English speech and those that
cannot: all his excluded forms can return to confound him in second-in­
tention English, as between quotation marks. Now some second-inten­
tion stimulations that could prompt a subj ect to assent to one of the que­
ries 'Bachelor ? ' and 'Unmarried man ? ' to the exclusion of the other are
as follows: a stimulation presenting the spelling of ' bachelor'; a stimula­
tion presenting the words 'rhymes with " harried man " ' ; a stimulation
presenting a glimpse of a bachelor friend together with a plea to redefine
' bachelor. ' It is not easy to find a behavioral criterion of second-intention
whereby to screen such cases, especially the last.
Leaving that problem unsolved, we have still to note another and
more humdrum restriction that needs to be observed in equating sen­
tences by stimulus meanings: we should stick to short sentences. Other­
wise subj ects' mere incapacity to digest long questions can, under our
definitions, issue in difference of stimulus meanings between long and
short sentences which we should prefer to find synonymous. A stimula­
tion may prompt assent to the short sentence and not to the long one j ust
because of the opacity of the long one; yet we should then like to say not
that the subj ect has shown the meaning of the long sentence to be differ-

Translation and Meaning

ent, but merely that he has failed to encompass it. Still a concept of syn­
onymy initially significant only for short sentences can be extended to
long sentences by analogy, e.g. as follows. By a construction, linguisti­
cally speaking, let us understand any fixed way of building a composite
expression from arbitrary components of appropriate sort, one or more
at a time. (What is fixed may include certain additive words, as well as
the wav of arranging the u nfixed components . ) Now two sentence-form­
ing constructions may be so related that whenever applied to the same
components they yield mutually synonymous results, as long as the re­
sults are short enough to be compared for synonymy. In this event it is
natural, by extension, to count also as mutually synonymous any results
of applying those constructions to identical components however long.
But to simplify ensuing considerations let us continue to reason without
reference to this refinement where we can.
Our success with 'Bachelor' and 'Unmarried man' has been sufficient,
despite the impasse at second intention, to tempt us to overestimate
how well intrasubj ective stimulus synonymy withstands collateral infor­
mation. By way of corrective, consider the Himalayan explorer who
has learned to apply 'Everest' to a distant mountain seen from Tibet
and ' Gaurisanker' to one seen from Nepal . As occasion sentences these
words have mutually exclusive stimulus meanings for him until his ex­
plorations reveal, to the surprise of all concerned, that the peaks are
identical . His discovery is painfully empirical, not lexicographic; never­
theless the stimulus meanings of ' Everest' and 'Gaurisanker' coincide for
him thenceforward . "
Or again consider the occasion sentences 'Indian nickel' and 'Buffalo
nicke l . ' These have distinct stimulus meanings for a boy for his first min­
ute or two of passive acquainta nce with these coins, and when he gets to
turning them over the stimulus meanings tend to fuse.
Do they fully fuse? The question whether ' I ndian nickel' and 'Buffalo
nickel' have the same stimulus meaning for a given subject is tbe ques­
tion whether any sequence of ocular irradiations or other stimulation
( within the modulus ) , realized or not, would now prompt the subj ect to
assent to or dissent from 'Indian nickel ' and not 'Bu ffalo nickel' or vice
versa. Among such stimulations are those that present, to all appear­
ances, a coin whose obverse is like that of an Indian nickel hut whose re-

1 1 . I am mdebtcd to DaVidson for thiS pomr and Schrodtnger\ What Is Ltfd, for
the example.

141

142

QUINTESSENCE

verse bears some device other than the buffalo . Such stimulations can
with a little felony even be realized. After a modulus-long examination
of such a hybrid coin, a novice might conclude with surprise that there
are a fter all two kinds o f Indian nickel, while an expert, s u re o f his nu­
mismatics, might conclude that the coin must be fraudulent. For the ex­
pert, 'Indian nickel' and 'Buffalo nickel' are stimul us-synonymous; for
the novice not.
The novice does believe and continues to believe, as the expert does,
that all Indian nickels are buffalo nickels and vice versa; for the novice
has not been and will not be actually subjected to the surprising stimula­
tion described. But the mere fact that there is such a stimulation pattern
and that the novice would now thus respond to it ( whether we know it
or not) is what, by definition, makes the stimulus meanings o f 'Indian
nickel' and 'Buffalo nickel' differ for the novice even as of now.
To keep our example pertinent we must a bstract from what may be
called the conniving mode of speech: the mode in which we knowingly
speak of Olivier as Macbeth, of a statue of a horse as a horse, of a false
nickel as a nickel. Even the expert would in practice speak of the pre­
pared coin as " that Indian nickel with the whoozis on the back , " adding
that it was phony. Here we have a broader usage o f 'nickel,' under which
nobody would seriously maintain even that all Indian nickels are in
point of fact buffalo nickels and vice versa; whereas our purpose in the
example is to examine two supposedly coextensive terms for sameness of
stimulus meaning. In the example, therefore, read 'Indian nickel' and
'buffalo nickel' as 'real Indian nickel , ' 'real buffalo nickel . '
From t h e example w e s e e that two terms c a n in fact b e coextensive, o r
true of the same things, without being intrasubj ectively stimulus-synony­
mous as occasion sentences. They can be believed coextensive without
being, even for the believer, stimulus-synonymous as occasion sentences;
witness 'Indian nickel' and 'Buffalo nickel' for the novice. But when as
i n the expert's case the belief is so firm that no pattern o f stimulation
( within the modulus ) would suffice to dislodge it, they are stimulus-syn­
onymous as occasion sentences.
So it is apparent that intrasubj ective stimulus synonymy remains open
to criticism, from intuitive preconceptions, for relating occasion sen­
tences whose stimulus meanings coincide on account of collateral infor­
mation. Now there is still a way of cutting out the effects o f idiosyncratic
information: we can hold out for virtual constancy over the commu­
nity. In this social sense of stimulus synonymy, 'Indian nickel' and 'Buf-

Tra nslation and ;Y1e�11llJ1g

fa lo n ickel' would cease to count as stimulus-synonymous, because of
such speakers as our novice; whereas ' Bachelors' and 'Unmarried man'
might still rate as stimulus-synonymous even socially, as being intrasub­
j ectivcly stimulus-synonymous for nearly everybody. There is still n o
screen against the effects of collateral information common t o t h e com­
munity; but, as urged in § 9 , I think that at that point the ideal becomes
illusory.
1 2 . Synonymy of Terms

In starting our consideration o f meaning with sentences we have hewn
the line of § § 3 and 4, where it was stressed that words are learned only
by a bstraction from their roles in learned sentences. But there are one­
word sentences, such as 'Red' and 'Rabbit: Insofar as the concept of
stimulus meaning may be said to constitute in some strained sense a
meaning concept for these, it would seem to constitute a meaning con­
cept for general terms like 'red' and 'rabbit.' This, however, is a mis­
take. Stimulus synonymy of the occasion sentences 'Gavaga i ' and 'Rab­
bit' does not even guarantee that 'gavagai' and 'rabbit' are coextensive
terms, terms true of the same things.
For, consider 'gavaga i . ' Who knows but what the objects to which this
term applies are not rab hits a fter all, but mere stages, or brief temporal
segments, of rabbits ? In either event the stimulus situations that prompt
assent to 'Gavagai' would he the same as for 'Rabbit.' Or perhaps the
ohjects to which 'gavagai' applies are all and sundry undetached parts of
rabbits; again the stimulus meaning would register no difference . When
from the sameness of stimulus meanings of 'Gavagai' and 'Rahbit' the
linguist leaps to the conclusion that a gavagai is a whole enduring rabbit,
he is j ust taking for granted that the native is enough like us to have a
brief general term for rabbits and no brief general term for rabbit stages
or parts.
A further alternative likewise compatible with the same old stimulus
meaning is to take 'gavagai' as a singular term naming the fusion, in
Goodman's sense, of all rabbits: that single though discontinuous por­
tion of the spatiotemporal world that consists of rabbits. Thus even the
distinction between general and singular terms is independent of stimu­
lus meaning. 'fhe same point can be seen by considering, conversely, the
singular term 'Bernard .J. O rtcutt': it differs none in stimulm meaning
from a general term true of each of the good dean's temporal segments,

1 4 .1

1 44

QUINTESSENCE

and none from a general term true of each of his spatial parts. And a still
fu rther alternative in the case of 'gavagai' is to take it as a singular term
naming a recurring universal, rahbithood. The distinction hetween con­
crete and abstract ohject, as well as that between general and singular
term, is independent of stimulus meaning.
Commonly we can translate something (e.g. 'for the sake of') into a
given language though nothing in that language corresponds to certain
of the component syllahlcs. Just so the occasion sentence 'Gavagai' is
translatable as saying that a rahhit is there, even if no part of 'Gavagai'
nor anything at all in the native language quite corresponds to the term
'rahhit. ' Synonymy of 'Gavagai' and 'Rahhit' as sentences turns on con­
siderations of prompted assent; not so synonymy of them as terms. We
are right to write 'Rabhit,' instead of 'rabhit,' as a signal that we are con­
sidering it in relation to what is synonymous with it as a sentence and
not in relation to what is synonymous with it as a term.
Does it seem that the imagined indecision between rahhits, stages of
rabbits, integral parts of rabhlts, the rabhit fusion, and ra hbithood must
be due merely to some special fault in our formulation of stimulus mean­
ing, and that it should be resoluble by a little supplementary pointing
and questioning? Consider, then, how. Point to a rabbit and you have
pointed to a stage of a rabbit, to an integral part of a rabbit, to the rabbit
fusion, and to where rabbithood is manifested. Point to a n integral part
of a rahhit and you have pointed again to the remaining four sorts of
things; and so on around. Nothing not distinguished in stimulus mean­
ing itself is to be distinguished by pointing, unless the pointing is accom­
panied by questions of identity and diversity: 'Is this the same gavagai as
that?,' 'Do we have here one gavagai or two ? ' . Such questioning requires
of the linguist a command of the native laoguage far beyond anything
that we have as yet seen how to account for. We cannot even say what
native locutions to count as analogues of terms as we know them, much
less equ ate them with ours term for term, except as we have also decided
what native devices to view as doing in their devious ways the work of
o u r own various auxiliaries to ohjective reference: our articles and pro­
nouns, our singular and plural, our copula, our identity predicate . " The

Intrasuhjective stimulus synonvmv, for all lh advant a ges over the two­

the considerations, whatever they are ( § § 1 5 and 1 6 ) , that make for con­
textual translation o f the identity predicate, the copula, and related par­
ticles.
Yet surely the main interest of the synonymy o f 'Bachelor' and 'Un­
married man' as occasion sentences was the line it seemed to give on the
synonymy o f ' bachelor' and 'unmarried man' as terms. Now within Eng­
lish the situation is not bevond saving. To get synonymy of terms from
synonymy of the corresponding occasion sentences we need only add a
condition that will screen out such pairs as ' bachelor' and 'part of a
bachel or'; and this we can do by requiring that the subj ect be prepared
to assent to the stand i ng sentence 'All h are G s and vice versa,' thinking
of ' F a n d ' G ' as the terms in question. The definition hecomes this: ' F
and ' G ' are stimulus-synonymous as terms for a speaker at t if and only
if as occasion sentences they have the same stimulus meaning for him at t
and he would assent to ' All Fs are Gs and vice versa' if asked at t. But we
can simplify this definition, by strengthening the latter part to make it as­
sure the former part. Instead o f j ust saying he would assent to 'All Fs arc
Gs and vice versa' as things stand at t, we can say he would still assent to
it, if to anything, following any stimulation that might be imposed at t.
(The 'if to anything' accommodates shock . ) This strengthened condition
assures that 'F' and 'G' will also agree in stimulus meaning as occasion
sentences; for, if each stimulation would leave the subj ect prepared to as­
sent to 'All Fs a re G s and vice versa' if to anything, then none would
prompt him to assent to o r d issent from one o f ' F and 'G' and not the
other. H
For reasons evident in % 1 4, [ call a sentence stimulus-analytic for
a subj ect i f he would assent to it, or nothing, after every stimulation
( within the modulus ) . Our condition o f stimulus synonymy of 'F' and
'c' as general terms then reduces to stimulus analyticity of 'All Fs are Cs
a n d vice vers a . ' This condition has its parallel for singular terms, repre­
sented by 'a' and 'I); viz., stimulus-analyticity o f 'a = Ii.' But note that
our formulations apply only to English and to languages whose transla­
tions of 'all,' 'are,' and ' =' are somehow settled in advance. This limita­
tion is to be expected in notions relating to terms.
Our simplification o f the definition of term synonymy extends it to all
terms, regardless o f whether their obj ects are such that we could reason14. Incoherent bch,H'\or I':> pO%lble, hut there I S J. l lIl1lt to the bIzarreness of l'xcep­

ably use the terms as occasion sentences. We must not conclude, from
seeming appropriateness of the definition as applied to terms like 'rab­
bit,' 'bachelor,' and 'buffalo nickel,' that it is as appropriate to the wider
domain. However, let us leave that question and think further about the
narrower domain.
Our version of synonymy makes the terms 'Indian nickel' and 'buffalo
nickel ' synonymous for the expert of § 1 1 , a n d not for the novice. It is
open to criticism, from intuitive preconceptions, for i ts equating of terms
whose coextensiveness the subject has learned by exploration and exper­
iment and not merely by encompassing their " meanings . " Such, then, is
the concept of stimulus synonymy of terms that comes out of stimulus
synonymy of occasion sentences for individual speakers. We can still so­
cialize the concept and so cut out the effects of idiosyncratic informa­
tion, as we did for occasion sentences at the end of § 1 1 : we can count
j ust those terms as socially stimulus-synonymous that come out stimu­
lus-synonymous for each individual speaker almost without exception.
Socially, ' bachelor' and 'unmarried man' remain sti mulus-synonymous
while 'Indian nickel' and 'buffalo nickel' do not.
We welcome this consequence of socializing our concept of stimulus
synonymy hecause our intuitive semantics " rates 'bachelor' and 'unmar­
ried man' as synonymous, and probably 'Indian nickel' and 'buffalo
nickel' not. But now what can have been the cause of those intuitive rat­
ings themselves ? Not, I think any close analogue, however unconscious,
of our present construction: not an implicit sociological guess that under
extraordinary stimulation most people would hold ' bachelor' and 'un­
married man' coextensive while many would let 'Indian nickel' and 'buf­
falo nickel' diverge. A likelier place to seck the cause is in the difference
between how we whose mother tongue is English learn 'bachelor' and
how we learn 'Indian nickel. ' We learn ' bachelor' by learning appropri­
ate associations of words with words, and 'Indian nickel' bv learning di­
rectly to associate the term with sample obj ects . " It is the difference, so
central to Russell's philosophy, between description and ,lcljuaintance. It
is kept before us in synchronic behavior as a difference between the non­
o bservational occasion sentences, with their random variation in stimu­
lus meaning from speaker to speaker, and o bservation sentences With

their socially uniform stimulus meanings. ( Cf. § 1 0 . ) One looks to 'un­
married man' as semantically anchoring 'bachelor' because there is no
socially constant stimulus meaning to govern the use of the word; sever
its tie with 'unmarried man' and you leave it no very evident social deter­
mination, hence no ntility in communication.
'Brother, ' in i t s synonymy with 'male sibling,' is essentially like 'bache­
lor' in its synonvmy with 'unmarried man . ' We learn 'brother' (in its ac­
curate adult use) only by verbal connections with sentences about child­
birth, and 'sibling' by verbal connections with 'brother' and 'sister. ' The
occasion sentences 'Brother' and 'Sibling' are non-observational: their
stimulus meanings vary over society in as random a fashion as that of
'Bachelor,' and it is only the few verbal links that give the terms the fixity
needed in communication.
Many terms of systematic theoretical science arc of a third sort. They
are like 'bachelor' and ' b rother' in having no socially constant stimulus
meanings to govern their use; indeed such a term is commonly useless in
the role of occasion sentence, so that there is no question of stimulus
meaning. Yet they are unlike 'bachelor' and 'brother' in having a more
complex network of verbal connections, so that no one tie seems cru­
cial to communication . Thus it is that in theoretical science, unless as
recast by semantics enthusiasts, distinctions between synonymies and
" factual " equivalences are seldom sensed or claimed. Even the identity
historically introduced into mechanics hy defining 'momentum' as 'mass
times velocity' takes its place in the network of connections on a par
with the rest; if a physicist su bsequently so revises mechanics that mo­
mentum fails to be proportional to velocity, the change will probably be
seen as a change of theory and not peculiarly of meaningY Synonymy
intuitions do not emerge here, j ust because the terms are linked to the
rest of language in more ways than words like 'bachelor' are . 1 8
1 3 . Translating Logical Connectives

In % § 7 through 1 1 we accounted for radical translation of occasion sen­
tences, by approximate identification of stimulus meanings. Now there
is also a decidedly different domain that lends itself directly to radical
translation: that of truth functions such as negation, logical conjunction,
1 7. Sec the last section of my " Carnap and Logical Truth" [ Chapter 4 1 .

and alternation. For this purpose the sentences put to the native for as­
sent or dissent may be occasion sentences and standing sentences indif­
ferently. Those that are occasion sentences will have to be accompanied
by a prompting stimulation, if assent or dissent is to be elicited; the
standing sentences, on the other hand, can be put without props. Now
by reference to assent and dissent we can state semantic criteria for truth
functions; i . e . , criteria for determining whether a given native idiom is to
be construed as expressing the truth function in question. The semantic
criterion of negation is that it turns any short sentence to which one will
assent into a sentence from which one will dissent, and vice versa. That
of conj unction is that it produces compounds to which (so long as the
component sentences are short) one is prepared to assent always and
only when one is prepared to assent to each component. Tha t of a lterna­
tion is similar with assent changed twice to dissent.
The point about short components is merely, as in § 1 1 , that when they
are long the subj ect may get mixed up. Identification o f a native idiom as
negation, or conj unction, or alternation, is not to be ruled out in view of
a subj ect's deviation from our semantic criteria when the deviation is due
merely to confusion. No limit is imposed on the lengths of the compo­
nent sentences to which negation, conjunction, or alternation may be ap­
plied; it is j ust that the test cases for first spotting such constructions in a
strange language are cases with short components.
When we find that a native construction fulfills one or another of these
three semantic criteria, we can ask no more toward an understanding of
it. Incidentally we can then translate the idiom into English as 'not,'
'and,' or 'or' as the case may be, but only subject to sundry humdrum
provisos; for it is well known that these three English words do not rep­
resent negation, conjunction, and alternation exactly and unambigu­
ously.
Any construction for compounding sentences from sentences is
counted in logic as expressing a truth function if it fulfills this condition:
the compound has a unique truth value ( truth or falsity) for each assign­
ment of truth values to the components. Semantic criteria can obviously
be stated for a ll truth functions a long the lines already followed for ne­
gation, conj unction, and alternation.
This approach ill accords with a doctrine of "prelogical mentality. " To

the explanauon. HIs cases of clustering correspond to my observational terms such

QUINTESSENCE

take the extreme case, let us suppose that certain natives are said to ac­
cept as true certain sentences translatable in the form 'p and not p . ' Now
this claim is a bsurd under our semantic criteria . And, not to be dogmatic
about them, what criteria might one prefer? Wanton translation can
make natives sound as queer as one pleases. Better translation imposes
our logic upon them, and would beg the question o f prelogicality if there
were a question to beg . ! '
Consider, f o r that matter, t h e Spaniard with h i s ' N o h a y n a d a . ' Lovers
of paradox may represent him as flouting the law of double negation.
Soberer translators may reckon 'no' and 'nada,' in this context, as halves
of one negative.
That fa i r translation preserves logical laws is implicit in practice even
where, to speak paradoxically, no foreign language is involved. Thus
when to our querying of an English sentence an English speaker answers
'Yes and no,' we assume that the queried sentence is meant differently in
the a ffirmation and negation; this rather than that he would be so silly as
to affirm and deny the same thing. Again, when someone espouses a
logic whose laws are ostensibly contrary to our own, we are ready to
speculate that he is j ust giving some familiar old vocables ( 'and,' 'or,'
'not,' 'all,' etc. ) new meanings. This talk of meaning is intuitive, uncriti­
cal, and undefined, but it is a piece with translation; what it registers is
our reluctance under such circumstances to "translate " the speaker's
English into our English by the normal tacit method of homophonic
translation.
O r consider the familiar remark that even the most audacious system­
builder is bound by the law of contradiction. How is he really bound? If
he were to accept contradiction, he would so readjust his logical laws as
to insure distinctions of some sort; for the classical laws yield all sen­
tences as conseq uences of any contradiction. But then we would proceed

to reconstrue his heroically novel l ogic as a non-contradictory l ogic, per­
haps even as familiar logic, in perverse notation.
The maxim o f translation underlying a l l this is that assertions start­
ingly false on the face o f them are likely to turn on hidden di fferences of
language. This maxim is strong enough in all o f us to swerve us even
from the homophonic method that is so fundamental to the very acquisi­
tion a n d use o f one's mother tongue.
The common sense behind the maxim is that one's interlocutor's silli­
ness, he yond a certain point, is less likely than bad translation-or, in the
domestic case, linguistic divergence .'" Another account of the matter, as
it touches logical laws in the domestic case, is as fol l ows. The logical par­
ticles 'and,' 'all,' etc. are learned only from sentential contexts. Dropping
a logical law means a devastatingly widespread unfixing of truth values
o f contexts o f the particles concerned, leaving n o fixity to rely on in us­
ing those particles. In short, their meanings are gone; new ones may be
supplied. What prompts a sense of meaning-involvement here is thus at
bottom the same as in the case of ' bachelor' and 'unmarried man' ( § 1 2 ) .
Let us now resume our reflections o n logic under radical translation.
We have settled a people's logical laws completely, so far as the truth­
functional part of logic goes, once we have fixed our translations by the
above semantic criteria. Truths of this part of logic are called tautolo­
gies: the truth-functional compounds that are true by truth-functional
structure alone. There is a familiar tabular routine for determining, for
sentences in which the truth functions are however immoderately iter­
ated and superimposed, j ust what assignments of truth values to the ultI­
mate component sentences will make the whole compound true; and the
tautologies a re the compounds that come out true under all assignments.
But the truth functions and tautologies are only the simplest o f the
l ogical functions and logical truths. Can we perhaps do bette r ? The logi­
cal functions that most naturally next suggest themselves are the cate­
goricals, traditionally designated A, E, I, and 0 , and commonly con­
strued in English by the constructions 'all are' ( 'All rabbits are timid ' ) ,
' none are,' 'some are,' 'some a r e not. ' A semantic criterion for A perhaps
suggests itself as fo llows: the compound commands assent ( from a given
speaker) if and only if the a ffirmative stimulus meaning ( for him) o f the
20. Cf. Wll,on's prInCIple of chanty: "We ,elect JS deslgnatum that mdlvldual

first component is a subdas> of the a ffirmative stimulus meaning of the
second component and the negative stimulus meanings are conversely
related. How to vary this for E, I, and 0 is obvious enough, except that
the whole idea is wrong in view o f § 12. Thus take A. All Indian nickels
are buffalo nickels, and even are believed by the novice o f § 12 to be buf­
falo nickels, but still the a ffi rmative stimulus meaning of 'Indian nickel,'
for our novice anyway, has stimulus patterns in it that are not in the a f­
firmative stimulus meaning of 'Buffalo nickel . ' On this score the sug­
gested semantic criterion is at odds with 'All Fs are Gs' in that it goes be­
yond extension. And It has a yet more serious failing o f the opposite
kind; for, whereas rabbit stages are not rabbits, we saw in § 12 that in
point o f stimulus meaning there is n o distinction.
The difficulty is fundamenta l . The categoricals depend for their truth
on the o bjects, however external and however inferential, o f which the
component terms are true; and what those objects are is not uniquely de­
termined by stimulus meanings. Indeed the categoricals, like plural end­
ings and identity, are part of our own special apparatus o f obj ective ref­
erence, whereas stimulus meaning is, to repeat § 1 2 , common coin. O f
what w e think of as logic, the truth-functional part is the o n l y part the
recognition of which, in d foreign l a nguage, we seem to be able to pin
down to behavioral criteria.
The condition that was seen to be inadequate as a semantic condition
for the A copula does still determine a copula. Let me write 'pars' for this
copula. Its usage is to be such that a compound of the form ' . . . pars
. . . " formed of two occasion sentences 5 , and 52 in that order, is a stand­
ing sentence and is to command assent of j ust the speakers for whom the
affirmative stimulus meaning o f 5, is a subclass of that o f 52 and con­
versel y for the negative. Thus, if we think of 5 , and 5 2 as general terms­
a detail of translation left open by stimulus meaning-then 'F pars G'
says approxi mately that every F is part of the fusion (§ 12) o f the Gs; and
i f we think o f 5 , and 5, as singular terms, ' a pars b' says approximately
that a i s part o f b . The theory o f the part relation, called mereology by
Lesniewski and the calculm of individuals by Goodman and Leonard,"
is thus more amenable to radical semantic criteria than is the logic of the
syllogism. But we must give full weight to the word 'approximately, '

1 4 . Synonymous a n d Ana lytic Sentences

By its etymology, 'synonymous' applies to names. Though in use the
term is intended simply to i mpute sameness of mean i ng, an effect of its
etymology is seen in a tendency to invoke some other word, 'equivalent'
or 'equipollent,' for cases where both of the compared expressions are
(unlike 'bachelor' ) verbally complex. My use of 'synonymous' is not
thus restricted; I intend the word to carry the full generality of 'same
in meaning,' whatever that is. Indeed I have made n o essential use of
a distinction between word and phrase. Even the first object of transla­
tion, say 'Gavagai,' may or may not in the end be parsed as a string of
several words, depending on one's eventual choice of analytical hypothe­
ses ( § § 1 5 , 1 6 ) .
Taking this minor liberalization hereafter for granted, w e still must
distinguish between a broad and a narrow type of synonymy, or same­
ness of meaning, as applied to sentences. The broad one may be formu­
lated in intuitive terms thus: the two sentences command assent concom­
itantly and dissent concomitantly, and this concomitance is due strictly
to word usage rather than to how things happen in the world. One usu­
ally hears the matter described in terms rather of truth values than of as­
sent and dissent; but I warp it over to the latter terms in order to maxi­
mize chances of making sense of the relation on the basis of verbal
behavior.
For some purposes a narrower sort of synonymy of ,entences is
wanted, such as what Carnap calls intensional isomorphism, involv­
ing certain pa rt-by-part correspondences of the sentences concerned.
( Cf. § 4 2 . ) But such variant versions can be defined on the basis of the
broader one. Synonymy of parts is defined by appeal to analogy of roles
in synonymous wholes; then synonymy in the narrower sense is defined
for the wholes by appeal to synonymy of homologous parts. So let us
concentrate on the broader and more basic n otion of ,entence syn­
onymy.
By talking in terms of assent and dissent here instead of in terms of
truth values we introduce this difficulty: assent and dissent can be influ­
enced by confusion due to a sentence's length and complexity. But this
difficulty can be accommodated in the way sketched in § 1 1. Also it

153

1 54

QUINTESSENCE

would be automatically taken care of under the program, j ust now men­
tioned, of deriving a relation of synonymy of sentence fragments and
thence constructing a reformed synonymy relation for wholes. Let us
pass over these points, for there is a more basic problem.
When the sentences are occasion sentences, the envisaged notion of
synonymy is pretty well realized in intrasubj ective stimulus synonymy,
especially as socialized. For we can argue that only verbal habit can
plausibly account for concomitant variation of two occasion sentences,
in point of assent and dissent, over the whole gamut of possible stimula­
tions. There are still the unscreened effects of community-wide collateral
information, but there is no evident reason not to count such informa­
tion simply as a determinant of the verbal habit ( § 9 ) . When the sentences
are standing sentences which, like 'The Times has come,' closely resem­
ble occasion sentences in the variability of assent and dissent, stimulus
synonymy still does pretty well.
But the less variable the standing sentences are in point of assent and
dissent, the sparser their stimulus meanings will be and hence the more
poorly stimulus synonymy will approximate to synonymy of the envis­
aged sort. For, however sparse its stimulus meaning, a sentence retains
its connections with other sentences and plays its distinctive part in theo­
ries. The sparseness of its stimulus meaning is no sparseness of meaning
intuitively speaking, but has the effect that stimulus meaning fails to do
the sentence much j ustice.
By lengthening the modulus of stimulation we can enrich the stimulus
meanings and so tighten the relation of stimulus synonymy; for, the
longer the stimulations the better their chance of influencing assent and
dissent. However, matters get out of hand when the modulus is exces­
sive. Thus consider stimulus synonymy modulo a month. To say that
two sentences are now so related is to say that any and every pattern of
month-long stimulation, if begun now and terminated next month with
a querying of the two sentences, would elicit the same verdict on both.
The trouble is that there is no telling what to expect under fairly fantas­
tic stimulation sequences of such duration. The subj ect might revise his
theories in unforeseeable ways that would be claimed to change mean­
ings of words. There is no reason to expect the concomitances of sen­
tences under such circumstances to reflect present sameness of mean­
ing in any intuitively plausible sense. Lengthening the modulus enriches
stimulus meanings and tightens stimulus synonymy only as it diminishes
scrutability of stimulus synonyms.

Translation a n d Meaning

Stimulus synonymy, on a n optimum modulus, is an approximation to
what philosophers loosely call sameness of confirming experiences and
of disconfirming experiences. It is a n approximation to what it might
mean "to speak of two statements as standing in the same germaneness­
relation to the same particular experiences . " 22 Where standing sentences
are of highly unoccasional type, the inadequacy of stimulus synonymy to
synonymy intuitively so-called is shared by the vaguer formulations j ust
now noted. And it is shared by the proposal of Perkins and Singer, viz. ,
that we compare sentences for synonymy hy putting them to our infor­
mant for verification and seeing whether he proceeds similarly in both
cases. The trouble lies in the interconnections of sentences. If the busi­
ness of a sentence can be exhausted by an account of the experiences that
would confirm or disconfirm it as an isolated sentence in its own right,
then the sentence is substantially an occasion sentence . The significant
trait of other sentences is that experience is relevant to them largely in in­
direct ways, through the mediation of associated sentences. Alternatives
emerge: experiences call for changing a theory, but do not indicate j ust
where and how. Any of various systematic changes can accommodate
the recalcitrant datum, and all the sentences affected by any of those
possible alternative readj ustments would evidently have to count as dis­
confirmed by that datum indiscriminately or not at all. Yet the sentences
can be quite unlike with respect to content, intuitively speaking, or role
in the containing theory.
Grice aod Strawson try (loe. cit.) to meet this difficulty by defining S ,
and S , as synonymous when, for every assumption as t o the truth values
of other sentences, the same experiences confirm ( and disconfirm) S,
on that assumption as confirm ( and disconfirm ) S, on that assumption.
Now instead of 'every assumption as to the truth values of other sen­
tences' we can as well say simply 'every sentence S'; for S can be the logi­
cal conj unction of those "other sentences " in question or their nega­
tions. So S , and S, are defined to be synonymous when, for every S, the
same experiences confirm ( and disconfirm ) S 1 Oll the hypothesis S as con­
firm ( and disconfirm) S 2 on S. The notion of confirmatory and discon­
firma tory experiences had a behavioral approximation in our notion of
stimulus meaning; hut can we relativize it thus to a hypoth esis S ? I think
we can; for confirmation or disconfirmation of S , on S is presumahly

confirmation or disconfirmation of the conditional sentence consisting
of S as antecedent and S I as consequent. Then the proposed definition of
synonymy becomes: SI and S 2 are synonymous if for every S the condi­
tional compound of S and S I and that of S and S, are stimulus-synony­
mous. But now it is apparent that the definition fails to provide a tighter
relation between S, and S2 than stimulus synonymy. For, if SI and S2 are
stimulus-synonymous than a fortiori the conditionals are too.
A variant suggestion would be to define SI and S, as synonymous
when, for every S, the logical conj unction of S and S I and that of S and S,
are stimulus-synonymous. But this is yet more readily seen not to pro­
vide a tighter relation.
If either of these ventures had succeeded, the synonymy yielded would
still have been strictly intralinguistic; for the auxiliary S, belonging to
one language, gets j oined to both S , and S,. But the language would not
have to be our own. For, by § 13, conj unction is translatable; and so is
the conditional, if we take it in the material sense 'Not (p and not q ) . '
The general relation of intrasubjective sentence synonymy thus unsuc­
cessfully sought is inter definable with another elusive notion of intuitive
philosophical semantics: that of an analytic sentence. Here the intuitive
notion is that the sentence is true purely by meaning and independently
of collateral information: thus 'No bachelor is married,' 'Pigs are pigs,'
and, by some accounts, '2 + 2 = 4.''' The interdefinitions run thus: sen­
tences are synonymous if and only if their biconditional ( formed by j oin­
ing them with 'if and only if' ) is analytic, and a sentence is analytic if and
only if synonymous with self-conditionals ( 'If p then P ' ) .
A s synonymy of sentences is related t o analyticity, so stimulus synon­
ymy of sen tences is related to stimulus analyticity (§ 1 2 ) .
Philosophical tradition hints of three nested categories o f firm truths:
the analytic, the a priori, and the necessary. Whether the first exhausts
the second, and the second the third, are traditional matters of disagree­
ment, though none of the three has traditionally been defined in terms
of detectable features of verbal behavior. Pressed nowadays for such a
2 3 . There IS a small confUSion that [ should like to take thIS opportunity to re­
solve, though It Ires aSLde from the malO course of the present reflectIOns. Those who
talk confidently of analytlclIY have been known to dIsagree on the analyticity of the
truths of anthmetIc, but dre about unan imous on that of the truths of logiC. We who
are less clear on the notIon of analytICIty may therefore seIze upon the generally

analytICIty; but to do thIS IS not to embrace the analytlc,ty of the truths of logic as an

clarification, some who are content to take the three as identical have
responded in this vein: the analytic sentences are those that we are pre­
pared to affirm come what may. This comes to naught unless we inde­
pendently circumscribe the 'what may. ' Thus one may obj ect that we
would not adhere to 'No bachelor is married' if we found a married
bachelor; and how are we to disallow his example without appealing to
the very notion of analyticity we are trying to define? One way is to take
'come what may' as 'come what stimulation ( § 8 ) may'; and this gives
virtually the definition (§ 1 2 ) of stimulus analyticity."
We improved stimulus synonymy a bit by socializing it. We can do the
same for analyticity, calling socially stimulus-analytic j ust the sentences
that are stimulus-analytic for a lmost everybody. But analyticity i n even
this improved sense will apply as well to 'There have been black dogs' as
to '2 + 2 = 4' and 'No bachelor is married.' Let us face it: our socialized
stimulus synonymy and stimulus analyticity are still not behavioristic re­
constructions of intuitive semantics, but only a behavioristic ersatz.
At the end of § 12 we speculated on what makes for the intuition of
synonymy of terms. Similar considerations apply to intuitions of sen­
tence synonymy and analyticity. Such an intuition figures in the case of
analyticity despite the technical sound of the word; sentences like 'No
unmarried m a n is married,' 'No bachelor is married,' and '2 + 2 = 4'
have a feel that everyone appreciates. Moreover the notion of " assent
come what may" gives no fair hint of the intuition involved. One's reac­
tion to denials of sentences typically felt as analytic has more i n it of
one's reaction to ungrasped foreign sentences. 2 \ Where the sentence con­
cerned is a law of l ogic, something of the ground of this reaction was dis­
cerned in § 1 3 : dropping a logical law disrupts a pattern on which the
communicative use of a logical particle heavily depends. Much the same
applies to '2 + 2 = 4,' and even to 'The parts o f the parts of a thing are
parts of the thing.' The key words here have countless further contexts
to anchor their usage, but somehow we fee l that if our interlocutor wil l
n o t agree with us o n these plati tudes there i s n o depending o n h i m i n
most of the further contexts containing t h e terms in question.
Examples like 'No bachelor is married' rate as analytic both directly
on the vague count j ust now conj ectured and by virtue of coming from
logical truths by synonymy substitution.

QUINTESSENCE

If the mechanism of analyticity intuitions is substantially as I have
vaguely suggested, they will in general tend to set in where bewilder­
ment sets in as to what the man who denies the sentence can be talking
about. This effect can be gradual and also cumulative." The intuitions
are blameless in their way, but it would be a mistake to look to them for
a sweeping epistemological dichotomy berween analytic truths as by­
products of language and synthetic truths as reports on the world. I sus­
pect that the notion of such a dichotomy only encourages confused im­
pressions of how language relates to the world. 2 7 Stimulus analyticity,
our strictly vegetarian imitation, is of course not here in question.
1 5 . Analytical Hypotheses

We have had our linguist observing native utterances and their circum­
stances passively, to begin with, and then selectively querying native sen­
tences for assent and dissent under varying circumstances. Let us sum up
the possible yield of such methods. ( 1 ) O bservation sentences can be
translated. There is uncertainty, but the situation is the normal induc­
tive one. ( 2 ) Truth functions can be translated. ( 3 ) Stimulus-analytic
sentences can be recognized. So can the sentences of the opposite type,
the " stimulus-contradictory' sentences, which command irreversible dis­
sent. (4) Questions of intrasubjective stimulus synonymy of native occa­
sion sentences even of non-observational kind can be settled if raised,
but the sentences cannot be translated.
And how does the linguist pass these bounds? In broad outline as fol­
lows. He segments heard utterances into conveniently short recurrent
parts, and thus compiles a list of native " words. " Various of these he hy26. Apostel and his assocIates have explored thIS matter expenmentally by asking
subjects to classify chosen sentences, wIth and wIthout the gUIdance of prior head·
ings. TheIr findings suggest a gradualism of intuitive analyticIty.
27. The notion is often uncrItIcally assumed In modern epistemological wntmg.
Sometimes It has been gIven a semblance of foundation 10 terms of " seman neal
rules" or " meaning postulates," but these deVices only assume the notion In diS­
guised form. ( See my "Two Dogmas of EmpJrlClsm" [Chapter 2] and " Carnap and
LogIcal Truth" [ Chapter 4] . ) My mIsgivings over the notion came out In a limIted
way In "Truth by ConventIOn" ( 1 93 6 ) [Chapter 1 ] , and figured increasingly In my
lectures at Harvard. Tarski a nd I long argued the point with Carnap there m 1 93940. Soon White was pursuing the matter with Goodman and me In tnangular corre­
spondence. The ensuing controversy has run to many articles and several books.

pathetically equates to English words and phrases, i n such a way as to
confirm to ( 1 )-( 4 ) . Such are his allalytlcal hyt)otheses, as I call them.
Their conformity to (1 )- ( 4 ) is ideally as follows. The sentence transla­
tions derivable from the analytical hypotheses arc to include those al­
ready established under ( 1 ) ; they are to fit the prior tra nslation of truth
functions, as of ( 2 ) ; they are to carry sentences that a rc stimulus-analytic
or stimulus-contradictory, according to ( 3 ) , into English sentences that
are likewise stimulus-analytic or stimulus-contradictory; and they are to
carry sentence pairs that arc stimulus-synonYJll o us, according to ( 4 ) ,
i n t o English sentences t h a t a r e likewise stimulus-synonymou s .
T h e analytical hypotheses are begun, however tentatively, long before
the work of (1 )-(4) is finished, and they help guide the choice of exam­
ples for investigation under ( 1 )-( 4). 'fhis point is essential to (4), since
without indirect hints through analytical hypotheses there is virtually no
telling what pairs of non-observational sentences to try for i ntrasubjec­
tive stimulus synonymy.
Our recipe is overschematic. I f the analytical hypotheses give some
English platitude as translation of some native standing sentence, there
would be encouragement in finding that the latter also commands gen­
eral and unreflective assent among natives, even if neither is quite stimu­
ILlS-analytic. Degrees of approximation to stimulus-analyticity, a s well as
degrees of observationality, would be allowed for i n a truer account.
And anyway the analytical hypotheses are not strictly required to con­
form to ( 1 )-(4) with respect to qu ite everv example; the necHer the ana­
lytical hypotheses, the more tolerance.
Tolerance is bound to have been exercised if a native sentence, be­
lieved by the whole community with a firmness that no stimulus pattern
of reasonable duration would suffice to shake, is translated as 'All rab­
bits a re men reincarnate. ' To translate a stimulus-analytic native sen­
tence thus into a n English sentence that is not stimul us-analytic is to in­
voke translator's license. I th ink this account gives such a translation
quite the proper air: that of a bold departure, to be adopted only if its
avoidance would seem to call for much more complicated analytical hy­
potheses. for certainly, the more absurd or exotic the beliefs imputed to
a people, the more suspicious we arc entitled to be of the translations;
the myth of the pre logical people marks only the extreme ." For transla­
tion theory, banal messages are the breath of life .

QUINTESSENCE

It may occur to th e reader to try to derive from stimulus analyticity a
finer analyticity concept by screening out sentences such as the native
one a bout reincarnation, using this criterion: through indirect consider­
ations they get translated into sentences of another language that are not
stimulus-analytic. However, this criterion is illusory because of its rela­
tivity to analytical hypotheses, which, as stressed in succeeding pages,
are not determinate functions of linguistic behavior.
Let us now get back to the analytical hypotheses for a more leisurely
consideration of their form and content. They are not in general held to
equational form. There is no need to insist that the native word be
equated outright to any one English word or phrase. Certain contexts
may be specified in which the word is to be translated one way and oth­
ers in which the word is to be translated in another way. The equational
form may be overlaid with supplementary semantical instructions ad li­
bitum. Since there is no general positional correspondence between the
words a n d phrases of one language and their translations in another,
some a nalytical hypotheses will be needed also to explain syntactical
constructions. These arc usually described with help of auxiliary terms
for various classes of native words and phrases. Taken together, the
analytical hypotheses and auxiliary definitions constitute the linguist's
j ungle-to-English dictionary and grammar. The form they are given is
immaterial because their purpose is not translation of words or con­
structions but translation of coherent discourse; single words and con­
structions come up for attention only as means to that end.
Nevertheless there is reason to draw particular attention to the simple
form of analytical hypothesis which equates a native word or construc­
tion to a hypothetical English equivalent. For hypotheses need thinking
up, and the typical case of thinking up is the case where the linguist ap­
prehends a parallelism in function between some component fragment
of a translated whole native sentence and some component word of the
translation of the sentence. Only in some such way can we account for
anyone's ever thinking to translate a native locution radically into Eng­
lish as a plural ending, or as the identity predicate ' = ,' or as a categorical
copula, or as any other part of our domestic apparatus of obj ective refer­
ence. It is only hy such outright projection of prior linguistic ha bits that
the linguist can find general terms in the native language at all, or, having
fo und them, match them with his own; stimulus meanings never suffice
to determine even what words are terms, if any, much less what terms
a re coexten si ve.

Tra nslation and Meaning

The method of analytical hypotheses is a way of catapulting oneself
into the j ungle language by the momentum of the home language. It is a
way of grafting exotic shoots on to the old familiar b ush-to recur to the
concluding metaphor of § 2-until only the exotic meets the eye. From
the point of view of a theory of translational meaning the most notable
thing about the analytical hypotheses is that they exceed anything im­
plicit in any native's dispositions to speech behavior. By bringing out
analogies between sentences that have yielded to translation and others
they extend the working limits of translation beyond where independent
evidence can exist.
Not that (1 )-(4) themselves cover all available evidence. For remem­
ber that we stated those only with reference to a linguist whose gathering
of data proceeded by q u erying native sentences for assent and dissent
under varying circumstances. A linguist can broaden his base, as re­
marked in § 1 1 , by becoming bilingual. Point ( I ) is there upon extended
to this: ( 1 ' ) All occasion sentences can be translated. Point ( 4 ) drops as
superfluous. But even o u r bilingual, when he brings off translations not
allowed for under ( 1 ' )-( 3 ) , must do so by essentially the method of ana­
lytical hypotheses, however unconscious. Thus s uppose, unrealistically
to begin with, that in learning the native language he had been able to
simulate the infantile situation to the extent of keeping his past knowl­
edge of languages out of account. Then, when as a bilingual he finally
turns to his project of a j ungle-to-English manual, he will have to proj ect
analytical hypotheses much as if his English personality were the linguist
and his j u ngle personality the informant; the differences are j ust that he
can introspect his experiments instead of staging them, that he has his
notable inside track on non-observational occasion sentences, and that
he will tend to feel his analytical hypotheses as obvious analogies when
he is aware of them at all. Now of course the truth is that he would not
have strictly simulated the infantile situation in learning the native lan­
guage, but would have helped himself with analytical hypotheses all
along the way; th u s the elements of the situation would in practice be
pretty inextricably scrambled. What with this circumstance and the fugi­
tive nature of introspective method, we have been better off theorizing
about meaning from the more primitive paradigm: that of the linguist
who deals observably with the native informant as live collaborator
rather than first ingesting him.
Whatever the details of its expository devices of word translation and
syntactical paradigm, the linguist's finished j ungle-to-English manual

161

1 62

QUINTESSENCE

has as its net yield an infinite semantic correlation of sentences: the im­
plicit specification of an English sentence, or various roughly inter­
changeable English sentences, for every one of the infinitely many possi­
ble j u ngle sentences. '\1ost of the semantic correlation is supported only
by analytical hypotheses, in their extension beyond the zone where in­
dependent evidence for translation is possible. That those unverifiable
translations proceed without mishap must not be taken as pragmatic evi­
dence of good lexicography, for mishap is impossible.
Thus let us recal l § 1 2, where we saw that stimulus meaning was inca­
pable of deciding among 'rabbit,' 'rabbit stage,' and various other terms
as translations of 'gavagai: If by analytical hypothesis we take 'are the
same' as translation of some construction in the j ungle language, we
may proceed on that basis to question our informant about sameness of
gavagais from occasion to occasion and so conclude that gavagais are
rabbits and not stages. But if instead we take 'are stages of the same ani­
mal' as translation of that j ungle construction, we will conclude from
the same subsequent questioning of our informant that gavagais arc rab­
bit stages. Both analytical hypotheses may be presumed possible. Both
could dou btless be accommodated by compensatory variations in ana­
lytical hypotheses concerning other locutions, so as to conform equally
to all independently discoverable translations of whole sentences and in­
deed all speech dispositions of all speakers concerned . And yet countless
native sentences admitting no independent check, not fa lling under ( 1 ' )­
( 3 ) , may be expected to receive radically unlike and incompatible Eng­
lish renderings under the two systems.
There is an obstacle to offering a n actual example of two such rival
systems of analytical hypotheses. Known languages arc known through
unique systems of analytical hypotheses established in tradition or pain­
fully a rrived at by un ique skilled linguists. To devise a contrasting system
would require an entire duplicate enterprise of translation, unaided even
by the usual hints from interpreters. Yet one has only to reflect on the
nature o f possible data and methods to appreciate the indeterminacy.
Sentences translatable outright, translatable by independent evidence of
stimulatorv occasions, arc sparse and must woefully under-determine
the analytical hypotheses on which the translation of all further sen­
tences depends. To project such hypotheses beyond the independently
translatable sentences :ll all is in effect to impute our sense of linguistic
analogy unverifiably to the native mind. Nor would the dictates even of
our own sense of analogy tend to any intrinsic uniqueness; using what

Translation and Meaning

first comes to mind engenders an air of determinacy though freedom
reign. There can be no doubt that rival systems of analytical hypotheses
can fit the totality of speech behavior to perfection, and can fit the total­
ity of dispositions to speech behavior as well, and still specify mutually
incompatible translations of countless sentences insusceptible of inde­
pendent control.
1 6 . On Fa ilure to Perceive the Indeterminacy

Thus the analytical hypotheses, and the grand synthetic one that they
add up to, are only in an incomplete sense hypotheses. Contrast the case
of translation of the occasion sentence 'Gavagai' by similarity of stimu­
lus meaning. This is a genuine hypothesis from sample observations,
though possihly wrong. ' Gavagai' and 'There's a rahhit' have stimulus
meanings for the two speakers, and these are roughly the same or sig­
nificantly different, whether we guess right or not. On the other hand no
such sense is made of the typical analytical hypothesis. The point is not
that we cannot he sure whether the analytical hypothesis is right, hut
that there is not even, as there was in the case of 'Gavagai,' a n ohj ective
matter to be right or wrong about.
There are at least seven causes of failure to appreciate this point. One
is that analytical hypotheses are confirmed in the field. Now this simply
means that supplementary cases of the sorts summed up under (1 )-(4) or
(1 ' )-( 3 ) of § 1 5 are gathered after the analytical hypotheses have been
framed. The unverifiable consequences I mean are translations not cov­
ered by (1 )-( 4 ) or even ( 1 ' )-( 3 ) . They can he defended only through the
analytical hypotheses, now and forever.
Another of the causes of failure to appreciate the point is confusion of
it with the more superficial reflection that uniqueness of grammatical
systematization is not to be expected. O hviously the grammatical theo­
ries can differ in word segmentations, in parts of speech, in construc­
tions, and perforce then in dictionaries of translation, and still have iden­
tical net outputs in the way of whole sentences and even of English
sentence translations. But I am talking of difference in net output.
A third cause of failure to appreciate the point is confusion of it with
the platitude that uniqueness of translation is a bsurd. The indeterminacy
that I mean is more radical. It is that rival systems of analytical hypothe­
ses can conform to all speech dispositions within each of the languages
concerned and yet dictate, in countless cases, utterly disparate trans-

lh3

1 64

QUINTESSENCE

lations; not mere mutual paraphrases, but translations each of which
would be excluded by the other system of translation. Two such transla­
tions might even be patently contrary in truth value, provided there is no
stimulation that would encourage assent to either.
A fourth and major cause of failure to appreciate the point is a stub­
born feeling that a true bilingual surely is in a position to make uniquely
right correlations of sentences generally between his languages. This
feeling is fostered by an uncritical mentalistic theory of ideas: each sen­
tence and its admissible translations express an identical idea in the bi­
lingual's mind. The feeling can also survive rejection of the ideas: one
can protest still that the sentence and its translations all correspond to
some identical even though unknown neural condition in the bilingual.
Now let us grant that; it is only to say that the bilingual has his own pri­
vate semantic correlation-in effect his private implicit system of analyt­
ical hypotheses-and that it is somehow in his nerves. My point remains;
for my point is then that another bilingual could have a semantic corre­
lation incompatible with the first bilingual's without deviating from the
first bilingual in his speech dispositions within either language, except in
his dispositions to translate.
A fifth cause is that linguists adhere to implicit supplementary canons
that help to limit their choice of analytical hypotheses. For example, if a
question were to arise over equating a short native locution to 'rabbit'
and a long one to 'rabbit part' or vice versa (§ 1 2 ) , they would favor the
former course, arguing that the more conspicuously segregated wholes
arc likelier to bear the simpler terms. Such an implicit canon is all very
well, unless mistaken for a substantive law of speech behavior.
A sixth cause is that a few early analytical hypotheses carry the lin­
guist so far. Once he has hypotheses covering identity, the copula, and
associated particles, he can translate terms by stimulus synonymy of sen­
tences. A few further hypotheses can create a medium in which to chal­
lenge native statements and elicit argument, or even to ask about intu­
itive synonymy. Abundant new structural data are then forthcoming,
and one fails to note the free prior decisions to which these data owe
their significance.
A seventh cause is that in framing his analytical hypotheses the lin­
guist is subj ect to practical constraints. For he is not, in his finitude, free
to assign English sentences to the infinitude of j ungle ones in j ust any
way whatever that will fit his supporting evidence; he has to assign them
in some way that is manageably systematic with respect to a manageably

Tra nslatIOn and :\,/lea ning

limited set of repeatable speech segments. O nce he has cut the segments,
begun his analytical hypotheses, and devised an auxiliary apparatus of
word classes for his formulations, his freedom of subsequent choice is
narrowed further still.
The linguist's working segmentation does yet more than narrow the
possibilities of analytical hypotheses. It even contributes to setting, for
him or the rest of us, the ends of translation. For a premium is put on
structural parallels: on correspondence between the parts of the native
sentence, as segmented, and the parts of the English translation. Other
things heing equal, the more literal translation is seen as more literally a
translation. A tendency to literal translation is assured anyway, since the
purpose of segmentation is to make long translations constructible from
short correspondences; bur one goes farther and makes of this tendencv
an ohj ective-and an ohj ective that even varies in detail with the practi­
cal segmentation adopted.
Complete radical translation goes on, and analytical hypotheses are
indispensahle. Nor are they capricious; we have seen in outline how they
are supported. May we not then say that in those very ways of thinking
up and supporting the ana lytical hypotheses a sense is a fter all given to
sameness of meaning of the expressions which those hypotheses equate ?
No. We could claim this only if no two conflicting sets of analytical hy­
potheses could be tied for first place on all theoretically accessible evi­
dence . The indefinability of synonymy by reference to the methodology
of analytical hypotheses is formally the same as the indefinabil ity of
truth by reference to scientific method ( § 5 ) . Also the consequences are
parallel. Just as we may meaningfully speak of the truth of a sentence
only within the terms of some theory or conceptual scheme (cf. § 5 ) , so
on the whole we may meaningfully speak of interlinguistic synonymy
only within the terms of some particular system of analytical hypotheses.
May we conclude that translational synonymy at its worst is no worse
off than truth in physics ? To be thus reassured is to misj udge the parallel.
In being able to speak of the truth of a sentence only witbin a more inclu­
sive theo ry, one is not much hampered; for one is always working within
some comfortably inclusive theory, however tentative. Truth is even
overtly relative to language, in that e.g. the form of words 'Brutus killed
Caesar' could by coincidence have unrelated uses in two languages; yet
this again little hampers one's talk of truth, for one works within some
language. In short, the parameters of truth stay conveniently fixed most
of the time. Not so the analytical hypotheses that constitute the parame-

165

1 66

QUINTESSENCE

ter of translation. We arc always ready to wonder about the meaning of
a foreigner's remark with out reference to any one set of analytical hy­
potheses, indeed even in the absence of any; yet two sets of analytical hy­
potheses equally compati ble with all linguistic behavior can give con­
trary answers, unless the remark is of one of the limited sorts that can be
translated without recourse to analytical hypotheses.
Something of the true situation verges on visibility when the sentences
concerned are extremely theoretical. Thus who would undertake to
translate 'Neutrinos lack mass' into the j ungle language ? If anyone docs,
we may expect him to coin words or distort the usage of old ones. We
may expect him to plead in extenuation that the natives lack the requi­
site concepts; also that they know too little physics. And he is right, ex­
cept for the hint of there being some free-floating, linguistically neutral
meaning which we capture, in 'Neutrinos lack mass,' and the native
cannot.
Containment in the Low German continuum facilitated translation of
Frisian into English ( § 7) , and containment in a continuum of cultural
evolution facilitated translation of Hungarian into English. Tn facilitat­
ing translation these continuities encourage an illusion of subj ect mat­
ter: an illusion that our so readily intertranslatable sentences are di­
verse verbal embodiments of some intercultural proposition or meaning,
when they are better seen as the merest variants of one and the same
intracultural verbalism. The discontinuity of radical translation tries our
meanings: really sets them over against their verbal embodiments, or,
more typically, finds nothing there.
O bservation sentences peel nicely; their meanings, stimulus meanings,
emerge absolute and free of residual verbal taint. Similarly for occasion
sentences more generally, since the linguist can go native. Theoretical
sentences such as 'Neutrinos lack mass,' or the law of entropy, or the
constancy of the speed of light, arc at the other extreme. It is of sllch sen­
tences a bove all that Wittgenstein's dictum holds true: " Understanding a
sentence means understanding a language . " 29 Such sentences, and count­
less ones that lie intermediate between the two extremes, lack linguisti­
cally neutral meaning.

Translation and Meaning

ses is due to real kinship of outlook on the part of the natives and our­
selves, and how much of it is due to linguistic ingenuity or lucky coinci­
dence. I am not sure that it even makes sense to ask. We may alternately
wonder at the inscrutability of the native mind and wonder at how very
much like us the native is, where in the one case we have merely muffed
the best translation and in the other case we have done a more thorough
job of reading our own provincial modes into the native's speech.
Thus consider, in contrast, a simple instance where cultural difference
does obj ectively manifest itself in language without intervention of ana­
lytical hypotheses. Certain islanders are said to speak of pelicans as their
half-brothers. One is not of course put off by this obvious shorthand
translation of a native word as 'half-brother' rather than in some such
more inclusive fashion as 'half-brother or totem associate. ' There re­
m ains an obj ective cultural difference apart from that, and it is linguisti­
cally reflected as follows: the islanders have a short occasion sentence
that commands an islander's assent indiscriminately on presentation of
any of his half-brothers or any pelican, and presumably no comparably
short one for the case of half-brothers exclusively, whereas English is op­
positely endowed. Such contrasts, between peoples' basic or short-sen­
tence partitionings of stimulations, are genuine cultural contrasts o bj ec­
tively describable by reference to stimulus meanings. Where cultural
contrasts begin to be threatened with meaninglessness is rather where
they depend on analytical hypotheses.
One frequently hears it urged that deep differences of language carry
with them ultimate differences in the way one thinks, or looks upon the
world. I would urge that what is most generally involved is indetermi­
nacy of correlation. There is less basis of comparison-less sense in say­
ing what is good translation and what is bad-the farther we get away
from sentences with visibly direct conditioning to non-verbal stimuli and
the farther we get off home ground.
Our advantage with a compatriot is that with little deviation the auto­
matic or homophonic ( § 1 3 ) hypothesis of translation fills the bill. If we
were perverse and ingenious we could scorn that hypothesis and devise
other analytical hypotheses that would attribute unimagined views to
our compatriot, while conforming to all his dispositions to verbal re­
sponse to all possible stimulations. Thinking in terms of radical transla­
tion of exotic languages has helped make factors vivid, but the main les­
son to be derived concerns the empirical slack in our own beliefs. For
our own views could be revised into those attributed to the compatriot

167

168

QUINTESSENCE

in the impractical joke imagined; no conflicts with experience could ever
supervene, except such as would attend our present sensible views as
well. To the same degree that the radical translation of sentences is un­
derdetermined by the totality of dispositions to verbal behavior, our own
theories and beliefs in general are under-determined by the totality of
possible sensory evidence time without end.
It may be protested that when two theories agree thus in point of all
possible sensory determinants they are in an important sense not two but
one. Certainly such theories are, as wholes, empirically equivalent. If
something is affirmed in the one theory and denied in the other, one may
argue that the particular form of words affirmed and denied is itself un­
like in meaning in the two cases but that the containing theories as
wholes have the same net meaning still. Similarly one may protest that
two systems of analytical hypotheses are, as wholes, equivalent so long
as no verbal behavior makes any difference between them; and, if they
offer seemingly discrepant English translations, one may again argue
that the apparent conflict is a conflict only of parts seen out of context.
Now this account is fair enough, apart from its glibness on the topic of
meaning; and it helps to make the principle of i ndeterminacy of transla­
tion less surprising. When two systems of analytical hypotheses fit the
totality of verbal dispositions to perfection and yet conflict in th eir trans­
lations of certain sentences, the conflict is precisely a conflict of parts
seen without the wholes. The principle of indeterminacy of translation
requires notice j ust because translation proceeds little by little and sen­
tences arc thought of as conveying meanings severally. That it requires
notice is plainly illustrated by the almost universal belief that the obj ec­
tive references of terms in radically different languages can be objectively
compared.
The indeterminacy of translation has been less generally appreciated
than its somewhat protean domestic analogue. In mentalistic philosophy
there is the familiar predicament of private worlds. In speculative neu­
rology there is the circumstance that different neural hookups can ac­
count for identical verbal behavior. In language learning there is the
multiplicity of individual histories capable of issuing in identical verbal
behavior. Still one is ready to say of the domestic situation in all posi­
tivistic reasona bleness that if two speakers match in all dispositions to
verbal behavior there is no sense in imagining semantic differences be­
tween them. It is ironic that the i nterlinguistic case is less noticed, for it is
j ust here that the semantic indeterminacy makes clear empirical sense.

P R O G R E S S O N TWO F R O NTS

I n these pages I update m y views on two epistemological matters.
1 . Preesta blished Harmony

Correct translation, we used to say, preserves meaning. In Word and Ob­
iect, I chary of mentalism and meaning, I represented correct translation
of an observation sentence as preserving what I called its stimulus mean­
ing. I explained its stimulus meaning as the range of stimulations, any
one of which would prompt the subj ect to assent to the sentence . Each
stimulation, in my sense of the term, was the ncar-simultaneous firing of
some subset of the subj ect's neuroceptors.
Not that I pictured the translator as neurologizing. I Ie would j ust
guess his translation of the native's observation sentence in the obvious
way, picturing himself in the native's stance and considering what Eng­
lish sentence it would prompt of him. Eventually, he would build his
translations of theoretic sentences upon those of observation sentences
by what I called analytical hypotheses; still no talk of nerve endings. Talk
of stimulus meaning and of analytical hypotheses was rather my busi­
ness, my theory of the translator's activity. Stimulus meaning was what,
theoretically speaking, correct translation of an observation sentence
preserved.
This is uncomfortable theory, however. It calls for sameness of stimu­
lus meaning of the native sentence for the native and the English senThanks to discussions With Burton Dreben, rhls paper has much Improved

tence for the translator, and hence a sharing of stimulations by native
and translator. Well, they cannot share Ileuroceptors, so we must settle
rather for homology of receptors. Such homology is by no means to he
expected, and anyway surely should not matter, as I remarked in a lec­
ture five years later.' I expressed the same discomfort again in 1 974, 1 cit­
ing Charles Darwin' on the diversity of nerve nets from individual to in­
dividual. But I saw no steps to take.
The matter surfaced again at a conference with Donald Davidson,
Burton Drehen, and Dagfinn Follesdal at Stanford in 1 9 8 6 . Davidson fa­
vored treating translation purely in terms of the external obj ects of refer­
ence, bypassing consideration of neural receptors. Such is the familiar
practice also of experimental psychologists, for whom the so-called stim­
ulus is out there, shared by subj ect and experimenter. I recognized the
adequacy of this obj ect-oriented line in describing the procedures of
translation, having descri bed them thus myself, and its adequacy like­
wise for lexicography. There remains a problem for epistemology and
neuropsychology, however, when we reflect with Darwin on the inter­
subjective diversity of nerve nets and receptors. How does the mere
sameness of the distal cause, the j ointly observed obj ect, prevail over the
diversity of the proximal segments of the causal chains, inside the two
observers, and still issue in agreeing response? In short, why can the
translator and the lexicographer blithely rest with the distal stimulus, as
indeed they can ?
Let me pinpoint the problem. A rabbit appears, the native says
' Gavagai,' and the translator conjectures 'Rabbit.' On a later occasion
they espy another rahbit, the translator says ' Gavagai,' and the native
concurs. The two occasions were perceptually similar' for the native, hy
his subj ective standards of perceptual similarity, and likewise for the
translator by his independently testa hie suhjective standards of percep­
tual similarity. Anatomic likeness of the native's receptors and those of
the translator could have helped to account for this agreement, but that
is out. What then does?
If I had thus pinpointed my uneasiness back then, I would have
quickly resolved it. What we have is a preestablished harmony of stan­
dards of perceptual similarity, independent of intersubj ective likeness of

receptors or sensations. Shades of G. W. Leibniz, thus, but without ap­
peal to divine intervention. The harmony is explained by a yet deeper,
but more faltering preestablished harmony between perceptual similar­
ity and the environment. This, in turn, is accounted for by natural selec­
tion, as follows.
We have, to begin with, an inductive instinct: we tend to expect per­
ceptually similar stimulations to have sequels that arc similar to each
other. This is the basis of expectation, habit formation, and learning.
Successful expectation has always had survival value, notably in the
elusion of predators and the capture of prey. Natural selection has ac­
cordingly favored innate standards of perceptual similarity which have
tended to harmonize with trends in the environment. lIenee the success,
so much better than random, of our inductions and expectations. Deriv­
atively, then, through our sharing of an ancestral gene pool, our innate
standards of perceptual similarity harmonize also intersubjectively.
Natural selection is Darwin's solvent of metaphysics. It dissolved Aris­
totle's final cause, teleology, into efficient calise, and now Leibniz's prees­
tablished harmony as well.
Harmony without interaction: that was the subtlety. We take its ubiq­
uitous effects for granted, not thinking them through. It was only in
From Stimulus to Science (pp. 20-2 1 ) that I got the matter into proper
focus and explained it as here.
Note that the harmony was needed not only in respect of the rabbits,
in my example, but also in respect of the utterance of 'Gavagai . ' The
sound of it was perceptually similar for the native and likewise for the
translator when it was spoken by either of them. This applies equally, of
course, to the child's learning of words from the mother.
The effect of the intersubj ective harmony, we sec, is that what the two
observers agree on is the shared distal subject matter and not the un­
shared proximal stimulations. The latter, however, are what are related
hy perceptual similarity, though not intersubjectively. Might it be more
straightforward to readjust the terminology and treat the external sub­
j ect matter as the relata of perceptual similarity ?
One reason not to is that it would put the whole vital causal struc­
ture of preestahlished harmony hack where it had heen, out of sight
and out of mind. Another reason is individuation. What is distally per­
ceived may he an ill-defined event rather than a body, or, if a body, a
body in an ill-defined range of perspectives, accommodating our two
ohservers on the occasion in question and perhaps excluding others. I
cut through all this hy adhering to the subj ect's neural intakes as the

171

1 72

relata of that subject's relation of perceptual similarity, which then en­
j oys harmony, generous but probably not complete, with that of other
subjects.
Ironically, I had described this harmony of perceptual similarity stan­
danls already in Roots of Reference, on the very page ( 2 3 ) where I then
proceeded to bemoan my dependence on intersubjective matching of
neural intakes. I even accounted for the harmony by natural selection,
shared environment, and heredity, j ust as in the present pages and in
From Stimulus to Science. My account differed only in one crucial de­
tail. Today, I have the two subjects exposed to the same external event,
whereas in Roots of R eference I was still grudgingly according them ho­
mologous neural intakes. It made a difference of twenty years. I left my­
self and others hanging with this enigmatic envoi: "I shall not pause over
the lesson, but there is surely one there " ( up. cit., p. 23 ) .
2 . Theory-Laden O b servation

In his early years, the only wa y a child can go wrong on an observation
sentence is by affirming it in a situation that would not have commanded
the adult's outright assent. Second thoughts are not yet relevant; they be­
come so only at a later stage, when scientific theory has begun to interre­
late observation sentences and generate conflict. The adult may affirm
'There's a rabbit' outright, and then rescind it when a later observation
suggests that it was the neighbor's cat.
In Word and Object (pp. 42-44) I consequently recognized degrees of
observationality, and treated the intrusion of theory or collateral infor­
mation as dilution of observationality. But in later writings, I held obser­
vationality as absolute, based on immediacy of assent, and then I ac­
commodated the intrusion of theory by contrasting the holophrastic
conditioning of the observation sentence to neural intake with the ana­
lytic relations of the component words to the rest of language. The sen­
tence figures holophrastically both in the infant's first acquisition of it
and in the scientist's immediate assent to it when testing a theory.
My attention was turned anew to these matters by a recent letter from
Lars Bergstrom adumbrating an empirical theory of truth. I ended up
not adopting it, but it has prompted me to reflect further on the bipolar­
ity of the holophrastic and analytic perspectives, as against the gradual­
ism of observationality in Word and Object. or, as we might say, a grad­
ualism of theoreticity.
In conclusion, I retained the absolute notion of an observation sen-

Progress on Two Fronts

tence as simply a n occasion sentence that commands the subj ect's imme­
diate assent, however fallible and revisa ble. Falli bility is then accommo­
dated in a separate dimension, theoreticity, which invests observation
sentences in varying degrees.
As before, all observation sentences are holophrastic in their associa­
tion to stimulation. Thus it is that assent to them is immediate, unless the
stimulation is off in the fringe of appropriate stimuli. Also, as before, it is
in the analytic or word-by-word relations of the sentence to others that
theory comes in, i n vary i ng degrees. Theoreticity is at a minimum in the
observation sentence 'That's blue,' and appreciable in 'That's a rabbit. ' It
may even be said to invest innate perceptual similarity, for theory is im­
plicit in our innate readiness to integrate varied perspectives into an o b­
j ective reality. A square on the floor, seen from various angles, proj ects
on the retina now a square and now one and an other trapezoid, but all
these neural intakes are perceptually similar; we are said to " see the
square. "
I am thus won over to Thomas Kuhn and others who have insisted
that observation is inseparable from theory. But my o bservation sen­
tences stay on in their old definition and their old role as clauses in the
observation categoricals that are the checkpoints of science.
This fits nicely with scientific practice. The experimenter settles for cri­
teria that he can confidently adjudicate on the spot: confidently, not in­
fallibly. He looks carefully, and if he is subsequently in doubt he repeats
the experiment if he can. The finality of a n experiment is historical, not
logical .
The evidential burden borne b y a highly theoretic observation sen­
tence such as 'There was copper in it,' when it is invoked at a check­
point, can certainly be shifted to less theoretic observation sentences by
deeper analysis. The ideal of reducing all checkpoints to minimally theo­
retic observation sentences like 'That's blue,' however, is the old phe­
nomenalistic reductionism of what I have long since despaired.
Observation categoricals, formed of observation sentences two by
two, remain the checkpoints of scientific theory as before, and the exper­
imental refutation of an implied categorical refutes the theory that im­
plied it. But the refutation is not final, for the refutation of the categori­
cal was not final; the experimenter may have misj udged the protasis
of the categorical as fulfilled, or misj udged the apodasis as failed, such
being the falli bility of observation. We j ust expect him to do the best
he can.

ONTOLOGY

9
O N W H AT T H E R E I S

A curious thing about t h e ontological problem is its simplicity. It c a n be
put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there ? ' It can be an­
swered, moreover, in a word-'Everything'-and everyone will accept
this answer as true. However, this is merely to say that there is what
there is. There remains room for disagreement over cases; and so the is­
sue has stayed alive down the centuries.
Suppose now that two philosophers, McX and I, differ over ontology.
Suppose McX maintains there is something which I maintain there is
not. McX can, quite consistently with his own point of view, describe
our difference o f opinion by saying that I refuse to recognize certain enti­
ties. I should protest, of course, that he is wrong in his formulation of
our disagreement, for I maintain that there are no entities, of the kind
which he alleges, for me to recognize; but my finding him wrong in his
formulation of our disagreement is unimportant, for I am committed to
considering him wrong in his ontology anyway.
When I try to formulate our difference of opinion, on the other hand, I
seem to be in a predicament. I cannot admit that there are some things
which McX countenances and I do not, for in admitting that there are
such things I should be contradicting my own rejection of them .
It would appear, if this reasoning were sound, that in any ontological
dispute the proponent of the negative side suffers the disadvantage of
not being able to admit that his opponent disagrees with him.
This is the old Platonic riddle of non being. Nonbeing must in some
sense be, otherwise what is it that there is not? This tangled doctrine
might be nicknamed Plato's beard; historically it has proved tough, fre­
quently dulling the edge of Occam's razor.
It is some such line of thought that leads philosophers like McX to im1 77

178

QUINTESSENCE

pure being where they might otherwise be quite content to recognize that
there is nothing. Thus, take Pegasus. If Pegasus were not, McX argues,
we should not be talking about anything when we use the word; there­
fore it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not. Thinking to
show thus that the denial of Pegasus cannot be coherently maintained,
he concludes that Pegasus is.
McX cannot, indeed, quite persuade himself that any region of space­
time, near or remote, contains a flying horse of flesh and blood. Pressed
for further details on Pegasus, then, he says that Pegasus is an idea in
men's minds. Here, however, a confusion begins to be apparent. We may
for the sake of argument concede that there is an entity, and even a
unique entity ( though this is rather implausible ) , which is the mental
Pegasus-idea; but this mental entity is not what people are talking about
when they deny Pegasus.
McX never confuses the Parthenon with the Parthenon-idea. The Par­
thenon is physical; the Parthenon-idea is mental ( according anyway to
McX's version of ideas, and I have no better to offe r ) . The Parthenon is
visible; the Parthenon-idea is invisible. We cannot easily imagine two
things more unlike, and less liable to confusion, than the Parthenon and
the Parthenon-idea. But when we shift from the Parthenon to Pegasus,
the confusion sets in-for no other reason than that McX would sooner
be deceived by the crudest and most flagrant counterfeit than grant the
non being of Pegasus.
The notion that Pegasus must be, because it would otherwise be non­
sense to say even that Pegasus is not, has been seen to lead McX into an
elementary confusion. Subtler minds, taking the same precept as their
starting point, come out with theories of Pegasus which are less pa­
tently misguided than McX's, and correspondingly more difficult to
eradicate. One of these subtler minds is named, let us say, Wyman. Pega­
sus, Wyman maintains, has his being as an unactualized possible. When
we say of Pegasus that there is no such thing, we are saying, more pre­
cisely, that Pegasus does not have the special attribute of actuality. Say­
ing that Pegasus is not actual is on a par, logically, with saying that the
Parthenon is not red; in either case we are saying something about an en­
tity whose being is unquestioned.
Wyman, by the way, is one of those philosophers who have united in
ruining the good old word 'exist. ' Despite his espousal of unactualized
possibles, he limits the word 'existence' to actuality-thus preserving
an illusion of ontological agreement between himself and us who repudi-

On

ate the rest of his bloated universe. We have all been prone to say, in
our common-sense usage of 'exist,' that Pegasus does not exist, meaning
simply that there is no such entity at all. If Pegasus existed he would in­
deed be in space and time, but only because the word 'Pegasus' has
spatia-temporal connotations, and not because 'exists' has spatia-tem­
poral connotations. If spatia-temporal reference is lacking when we af­
firm the existence of the cube root of 27, this is simply because a cube
root is not a spatia-temporal kind of thing, and not because we are being
ambiguous in our use of 'exist. ' 1 However, Wyman, in an ill-conceived
effort to appear agreeahle, genially grants us the nonexistence of Pegasus
and then, contrary to what we meant by nonexistence of Pegasus, insists
that Pegasus is. Existence is one thing, he says, and subsistence is an­
other. The only way I know of coping with this obfuscation of issues is to
give Wyman the word 'exist.' I'll try not to use it again; I still have 'is.' So
much for lexicography; let's get back to Wyman's ontology.
Wyman's overpopulated universe is in many ways unlovely. It offends
the aesthetic sense of us who have a taste for desert landscapes, bur
this is not the worst of it. Wyman's slum of possibles is a breeding
ground for disorderly elements. Take, for instance, the possible fat man
in that doorway; and, again, the possible bald man in that doorway.
Are they the same possible man, or two possible men ? How do we de­
cide ? How many possible men are there in that doorway ? Are there
more possible thin ones than fat ones? How many of them are alike ? Or
would their being alike make them one ? Are no two possible things
alike ? Is this the same as saying that it is impossible for two things to be
alike ? O r, finally, is the concept of identity simply inapplicable to unac­
tualized possibles ? But what sense can be found in talking of entities
which cannot meaningfully be said to be identical with themselves and
distinct from one anothe r ? These elements are well-nigh incorrigible. By
a Fregean therapy of individual concepts,' some effort might be made at

rehabilitation; but I feel we'd do better simply to clear Wyman's slum
and be done with it.
Possibility, along with the other modalities of necessity and impossi­
bility and contingency, raises problems upon which I do not mean to im­
ply that we should turn our backs. But we can at least limit modalities to
whole statements. We may impose the adverb 'possibly' upon a state­
ment as a whole, and we may well worry about the semantical analysis
of such usage; hut little real advance i n such analysis is to be hoped for in
expanding our universe to include so-called possible entities. I suspect
that the main motive for this expansion is simply the old notion that Peg­
asus, for example, must be because otherwise it would be nonsense to
say even that he is not.
Still, all the rank luxuriance of Wyman's universe of possibles would
seem to come to naught when we make a slight change in the example
and speak not of Pegasus but of the round square cupola on Berkeley
College. If, unless Pegasus were, it would be nonsense to say that he is
not, then by the same token, unless the round square cupola on Berkeley
College were, it would be nonsense to say that it is not. But, unlike Pega­
sus, the round square cupola on Berkeley College cannot be admitted
even as an unactualized possible. Can we drive Wyman now to admit­
ting also a realm of unactualizable impossibles? I f so, a good many em­
barrassing questions could be asked about them. We might hope even to
trap Wyman in contradictions, by getting him to admit that certain of
these entities are at once round and square. But the wily Wyman chooses
the other horn of the dilemma and concedes that it is nonsense to say
that the round square cupola on Berkeley College is not. He says that the
phrase 'round square cupola ' is meaningless.
Wyman was not the first to embrace this alternative. The doctrine of
the meaninglessness of contradictions runs away back. The tradition
survives, moreover, in writers who seem to share none of Wyman's moti­
vations. Still, I wonder whether the first temptation to such a doctrine
may not have been substantially the motivation which we have observed
in Wyman. Certainly the doctrine has no intrinsic appeal; and it has led
its devotees to such quixotic extremes as that of challenging the method
of proof by reductio ad absurdum-a challenge in which I sense a reduc­
tio ad absurdum of the doctrine itself.
Moreover, the doctrine of meaninglessness of contradictions has the
severe methodological drawback that it makes it impossible, i n princi­
ple, ever to devise an effective test of what is meaningful and what is not.

On What There I s

It would be forever impossible for us to devise systematic ways of decid­
ing whether a string of signs made sense-even to us individually, let
alone other people-or not. For it follows from a discovery in mathe­
matical logic, due to Church, that there can be no generally applicable
test of contradictoriness.
I have spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard, and hinted that it is tan­
gled. I have dwelt at length on the inconveniences of putting up with it. It
is time to think a bout taking steps.
Russell, in his theory of so-called singular descriptions, showed clearly
how we might meaningfully use seeming names without supposing that
there be the entities allegedly named. The names to which Russell's the­
ory directly applies are complex descriptive names such as 'the author of
Waverley, ' 'the present King of France,' 'the round square cupola on
Berkeley College . ' Russell analyzes such phrases systematically as frag­
ments of the whole sentences in which they OCCut. The sentence 'The au­
thor of Waverley was a poet,' for example, is explained as a whole as
meaning 'Someone ( better: something) wrote Waverley and was a poet,
and nothing else wrote Waverley. ' (The point of this added clause is to
affirm the uniqueness which is implicit in the word 'the,' in 'the author
of Waverley. ' ) The sentence 'The round square cupola on Berkeley Col­
lege is pink' is explained as 'Something is round and square and is a cu­
pola on Berkeley College and is pink, and nothing else is round and
square and a cupola on Berkeley College . "
T h e virtue of this analysis is t h a t t h e seeming name, a descriptive
phrase, is paraphrased in context as a so-called incomplete symbol. No
unified expression is offered as an analysis of the descriptive phrase, but
the statement as a whole which was the context of that phrase still gets
its full quota of meaning-whether true or false.
The unanalyzed statement 'The author of Waverley was a poet' con­
tains a part, 'the author of Waverley, ' which is wrongly supposed by
McX and Wyman to demand obj ective reference in order to be meaning­
ful at all. But in Russell's translation, 'Something wrote Waverley and
was a poet and nothing else wrote Waverley, ' the burden of obj ective ref­
erence which had been put upon the descriptive phrase is now taken over
by words of the kind that logicians call bound variables, variables of
quantification, namely, words like 'something,' 'nothing,' 'everything.'

QUINTES SENCE

These words, far from purporting to be names specifically of the author
of Waverley, do not purport to be names at all; they refer to entities gen­
erally, with a kind of studied a mbiguity peculiar to themselves.4 These
quantificational words or bound variables are, of course, a basic part of
language, and their meaningfulness, at least in context, is not to be chal­
lenged. But their meaningfulness in no way presupposes there being ei­
ther the author of Waverley or the round square cupola on Berkeley Col­
lege or any other specifically preassigned obj ects.
Where descriptions are concerned, there is no longer any difficulty
in affirming or denying being. 'There is the author of Waverley ' is
explained by Russell as meaning 'Someone ( o r, more strictly, some­
thing) wrote Waverley and nothing else wrote Waverley. ' 'The author of
Waverley is not' is explained, correspondingly, as the alternation 'Either
each thing failed to write Waverley or two or more things wrote Waver­
ley. ' This alternation is false, but meaningful; and it contains no expres­
sion purporting to name the author of Waverley. The statement 'The
round square cupola on Berkeley College is not' is analyzed in simi­
lar fashion. So the old notion that statements of non being defeat them­
selves goes by the board. When a statement of being or non being is
analyzed by Russell's theory of descriptions, it ceases to contain any ex­
pression which even purports to name the alleged entity whose being is
in question, so that the meaningfulness of the statement no longer can be
thought to presuppose that there be such an entity.
Now what of 'Pegasus' ? This being a word rather than a descriptive
phrase, Russell's argument does not immediately apply to it. However, it
can easily be made to apply. We have only to rephrase 'Pegasus' as a de­
scription, in any way that seems adequately to single out our idea; say,
'the winged horse that has captured by Belleropho n . ' Substituting such a
phrase for 'Pegasus,' we can then proceed to analyze the statement 'Peg­
asus is,' or 'Pegasus is not,' precisely on the analogy of Russell's analysis
of 'The author of Waverley is' and 'The author of Waverley is not.'
In order thus to subsume a one-word name or alleged name such as
'Pegasus' under Russell's theory of description, we must, of course, be
a ble first to translate the word into a description. But this is no real re­
striction. If the notion of Pegasus had been so obscure or so basic a one
that no pat translation into a descriptive phrase had offered itself along

familiar lines, we could still have availed ou rselves of the following arti­
ficial and trivial-seeming device: we could have appealed to the ex hy ­
pothesi unanalyzable, irreducible attribute of being Pegasus, adopting,
for its expression, the verb 'is-Pegasus,' or " pegasizes . ' The ooun 'Pega­
sus' itself could then be treated as derivative, and identified after all with
a description: 'the thing that is-Pegasus,' 'the thing that pegasizes. "
If the importing of such a predicate as 'pegasizes' seems t o commit
us to recognizing that there is a corresponding attribute, pegasizing, in
Plato's hea Yen or in the minds of men, well and good. Neither we nor
Wyman nor McX have been contending, thus far, a bout the being or
non being of universals, but rather about that of Pegasus. If in terms of
pegasizing we can interpret the noun 'Pegasus' as a description subj ect to
Russell's theory o f descriptions, then we have d i sposed of the old notion
that Pegasus cannot be said not to be without presupposing that in some
sense Pegasus is.
Our argument is now quite general. McX and Wyman supposed that
we could not meaningfully a ffirm a statement of the form 'So-and-so is
not,' with a simple or descriptive singular noun in place of 'so-and-so:
unless so-and-so is. This supposition is now seen to be quite generally
groundless, since the singular noun in question can always be expanded
into a singular description, trivially or otherwise, and then analyzed out
a la Russell.
We commit ourselves to an ontology containing numbers when we say
there arc prime numbers b rger than a million; we commit o urselves to
an ontology containing centaurs when we say there arc centaurs; and we
commit ourselves to an ontol ogy containing Pegasus when we say Pega­
sus is. But we do not commit ourselves to an ontologv containing Pega­
sus or the author of Waverley or the round square cupola on Berkeley
College when we say that Pegasus or the author of Waverley or the cu­
pola in question is not. We need no longer labor under the delusion that
the meaningfulness of a statement containing a singular term presup­
poses an entity named by the term. A singular term need not name to be
significant.
An iokling of this might have dawned on Wyman and McX even with­
out benefit of Russell if they had only noticed-as so few o f li S do-that
there is a gulf between meaning and naming even in the case of a singular
5 . For further remarks on such aSSIlTIliJuon of all 'imguiar teflll S to dcscnptlol1s

term which is genuinely a name of an object. The following example
from Frege will serv e . The phrase 'Evening Star' names a certain l arge
physical object of spherical form, which is hurtling through space some
scores of millions of miles from here. The phrase 'Morning Star' names
the same thing, as was probably first established by some observant Bab­
ylonian. But the two phrases cannot be regarded as having the same
meaning; otherwise that Babylonian could have dispensed with his ob­
servations and contented himself with reflecting on the meanings of his
words. The meanings, then, being different from one another, must be
other than the named obj ect, which is one and the same in both cases.
Confusion of meaning with naming not only made McX think he
could not meaningfully repudiate Pegasus; a continuing confusion of
meaning with naming no doubt helped engender his a bsurd notion that
Pegasus is an idea, a mental entity. The structure of his confusion is as
follows. He confused the alleged named object Pegasus with the meaning
of the word 'Pegasus,' therefore concluding that Pegasus must be in or­
der that the word have meaning. But what sorts of things are meanings ?
This is a moot point; however, one might quite plausibly explain mean­
ings as ideas in the mind, supposing we can make clear sense in turn of
the idea of ideas in the mind. Therefore Pegasus, initially confused with a
meaning, ends up as an idea in the mind. It is the more remarkable that
Wyman, subj ect to the same initial motivation as -'1cX, should have
avoided this particular blunder and wound up with unactualized possi­
hies instead.
Now let us turn to the ontological problem of universals: the question
whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,
functions. -'1cX, characteristically enough, thinks there are. Speaking of
attributes, he says: "There are red houses, red roses, red sunsets; this
much is prephilosophical common sense in which we must all agree.
These houses, roses, and sunsets, then, have something in common; and
this which they have in common is all I mean hy the attribute of red­
ness . " For McX, thus, there being attributes is even more obvious and
trivial than the obvious and trivial fact of there being red houses, roses,
and sunsets. This, I think, is characteristic of metaphysics, or at least of
that part of metaphysics called ontology: one who regards a statement
on this suhj ect as true at all must regard it as trivially true . One's ontol­
ogy is basic to the conceptual scheme by which he interprets all experi­
ences, even the most commonplace ones. Judged within some particular
conceptual scheme-and how else is j udgment possible?-an ontological

statement goes without saying, standing in need of no separate j ustifica­
tion at all. O ntological statements follow immediately from all manner
of casual statements of commonplace fact, j ust as-from the point of
view, anyway, of McX's conceptual scheme-'There is an attribute' fol­
lows from 'There are red houses, red roses, red sunsets . '
Judged in another conceptual scheme, an ontological statement which
is axiomatic to McX's mind may, with equal immediacy and triviality, be
adjudged false. One may admit that there are red houses, roses, and sun­
sets, bur deny, except as a popular and misleading manner of speaking,
that they have anything in common. The words 'houses,' 'roses,' and
'sunsets' are true of sundry individual entities which are houses and
roses and sunsets, and the word 'red' or 'red obj ect' is true of each of
sundry individual entities which are red houses, red roses, red sunsets;
bur there is not, in addition, any entity whatever, individual or other­
wise, which is named by the word 'redness,' nor, for that matter, by the
word 'househood,' 'rosehood,' 'sunsethoo d . ' That the houses and roses
and s unsets are all of them red may be taken as ultimate and irreducible,
and it may be held that McX is no better off, in point of real explanatory
power, for all the occult entities which he posits under such names as
'redness.'
O n e m ea ns by which McX might naturally h a v e tried to impose h i s
ontology of un iversals on us was already removed before we turned t o
the problem of universals. McX ca n n o t a r g u e t h a t predicates su c h as
'red' or 'is-red,' which we all concur in using, must be regarded as names
each of a single u niversal entity in order that they be meaningful at all.
For we have seen that being a name of something is a much more special
fea ture than being meaningful. He cannot even charge us-at least not
by that a rgument-with having posited an attribure of pegasizing by our
adoption of the predicate 'pegasize s . '
However, M c X h i t s u p o n a different strategem. " Let us grant," h e
s a y s , " this distinction between meaning and naming of which you make
so much. Let us even grant that 'is red,' 'pegasizes,' etc . , are not names
of attri butes. Still, you admit they have meanings. But these meanings,
whether they are named or not, are still universals, and I venture to say
that some of them might even be the very things that I call attributes, or
something to much the same purpose in the end . "
For McX, this i s an unusually penetrating speech; a n d the only way I
know to counter it is by refusing to admit meanings. However, I feel no
reluctance toward refusing to admit meanings, for I do not thereby deny

1 85

1 86

QUINTESSENCE

that words and statements are meaningful. McX and I may agree to the
letter in our classification of linguistic forms into the meaningful and the
meaningless, even though McX construes meaningfulness as the having
( i n some sense of 'having ' ) of some a bstract entity which he calls a mean­
ing, whereas I do n ot. I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given
linguistic utterance is meaningful ( o r significant, as I prefer to say so as
not to invite hypostasis o f meanings as entities) is a n ultimate and irre­
ducible matter of fact; or, I may undertake to analyze it in terms directly
of what people do in the presence of the linguistic utterance in question
and other utterances similar to it.
The useful ways in which people ordinarily talk or seem to talk about
meanings boil down to two: the having of meanings, which is signifi­
cance, and sameness of meaning, or synonymy. What is called giving the
meaning of an utterance is simply the uttering of a synonym, couched,
ordinarily, in clearer language than the original. If we are allergic to
meanings as such, we can speak directly of utterances as significant or
insignificant, and as synonymous or heteronymous one with another.
The problem of explaining these adj ectives 'significant' and 'synony­
mous' with some degree of clarity and rigor-preferably, as I see it, in
terms of behavior-is as difficult as it important.6 But the explanatory
value of special and irreducible intermediary entities called meanings is
surely illusory.
Up to now I have argued that we can use singular terms significantly in
sentences without presupposing that there are the entities which those
terms purport to name. I have argued further that we can use general
terms, for example, predicates, without conceding them to be names of
a bstract entities. I have argued further that we can view utterances as
significant, and as synonymous or heteronymous with one another, with­
out countenancing a realm of entities called meanings. At this point
McX begins to wonder whether there is any limit at all to our ontologi­
cal immunity. Does nothing we may say commit us to the assumption of
universals or other entities which we may find unwelcome ?
I have already suggested a negative answer to this question, in speak­
ing of bound variables, or variables of quantification, in connection with
Russell's theory of descriptions. We can very easily involve ourselves in
ontological commitments by saying, for example, that there is something
( bound variable) which red houses and sunsets have in common; or that

gUIstic;," From a LogIcal Pomt of VieW, pp. 4 7-6 4 ) .

On What There Is

there is something which is a prime numher larger than a million. But
this is, essentially, the only way we can involve ourselves in ontological
commitments: by our use of bound variables. The use of alleged names is
no criterion, for we can repudiate their namehood at the drop of a hat
unless the assumption of a corresponding entity can be spotted in the
things we a ffirm in terms of bound variables. Names are, in fact, a lto­
gether immaterial to the ontological issue, for I have shown, in connec­
tion with 'Pegasus' and 'pegasize,' that names can be converted to de­
scriptions, and Russell has shown that descriptions can be eliminated.
Whatever we say with the help of names can be said in a language which
shuns names altogether. To be assumed as an entity is, purely and simply,
to be reckoned as the value of a variable . In terms of the categories of
traditional grammar, this amounts roughly to saying that to be is to be in
the range of reference of a pronoun. Pronouns are the basic media of ref­
erence; nouns might better have been named propronouns. The variables
of quantification, 'something,' 'nothing,' 'everything,' range over our
whole ontology, whatever it may be; and we are convicted of a particular
ontological presupposition if, and only if, the alleged presuppositum has
to be reckoned among the entities over which our variables range in or­
der to render one of our affirmations true.
We may say, for example, that some dogs are white and not thereby
commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood or whiteness as entities.
'Some dogs are white' sa ys that some things that arc dogs are white; and,
in order that this statement be true, the things over which the bound
variable 'something' ranges must include some white dogs, hut need not
include doghood or whiteness. O n the other hand, when we say that
some zoological species are cross-fertile we arc committing ourselves to
recognizing as entities the several species themselves, ahstract though
they are. We remain so committed at least until we devise some way of so
paraphrasing the statement as to show that the seeming reference to spe­
cies on the part of our bound variable was an avoidable manner of
speaking.'
Classical mathematics, as the example of primes larger than a million
clearly illustrates, is up to its neck in commitments to an ontology of ab­
stract entities. Thus it is that the great mediaeval controversy over uni­
versals has flared up anew in the modern philosophy of mathematics.
The issue is clearer now than of old, because we now have a more ex7. For more on thiS tOpiC see Essay 6 (Qu1l1e, " LogiC and the ReificatIon of Univer­

plicit standard whereby to decide what ontology a given theory or form
of discourse is committed to: a theory is committed to those and only
those entities to which the bound variables of the theory must be capable
o f referring in order that the affirmations made in the theory be truc.
Because this standard of ontological presupposition did not emerge
clearly in the philosophical tradition, the modern philosophical mathe­
maticians have not on the whole recognized that they were debating the
same old problem of universals in a newly clarified form. Hut the funda­
mental cleavages among modern points of view on foundations of math­
ematics do come down pretty explicitly to disagreements as to the range
of entities to which the bound variables should be permitted to refer.
The three main mediaeval points of view regarding universals are des­
ignated by historians as realism, conceptualism, and nominalism. Essen­
tially these same three doctrines reappear in twentieth-century surveys of
the philosophy of mathematics under the new names logicism, intuition­
ism, and formalism.
Rmlism, as the word is used in connection with the mediaeval contro­
versy over universals, is the Platonic doctrine that universals or a bstract
entities have being independently of the mind; the mind may discover
them but cannot create them. Logicism, represented by Frcge, Russell,
Whitehead, Church, and Carnap, condones the use of bound variables
to refer to abstract entities known and unknown, specifiable and unspe­
cifiable, indiscriminately.
Conceptualism holds that there are universals but they are mind­
made. Intuitionism, espoused in modern times in one form or a nother hy
Poincare, Brouwer, Weyl, and others, countenances the use of bound
variables to refer to abstract entities only when those entities arc capable
of heing cooked up individually from ingredients specified in advance.
As Fraenkel has put it, logicism holds that classes are discovered while
intuitionism holds that they are invented-a fair statement indeed of the
old opposition between realism and conceptualism. This opposition is
no mere quibble; it makcs an essential difference in the amount of classi­
cal mathematics to which one is willing to subscribe. Logicists, or real­
ists, are able on their assumptions to get Cantor's ascending orders of
infinity; intuitionists are compelled to stop with the lowest order of
infinity, and, as an indirect consequence, to abandon even some of the
classical laws of real numbers.' The modern controversy between log­
icism and intuitionism arose, in fact, from disagreements ovcr infinity.

Formaltsm, associated with the name of Hilbert, echoes intuitionism
in deploring the logicist's unbridled recourse to universals. But formal­
ism also finds intuitionism unsatisfactory. This could happeo for either
of two opposite reasons. The formalist might, like the l ogicist, object to
the crippling of classical mathematics; or he might, like the nominalists
of old, object to admitting abstract entities at all, even in the restrained
sense of mind-made entities. The upshot is the same: the formalist keeps
classical mathematics as a play of insignificant notations. 'fhis play of
notations can still be of utility-whatever utility it has already shown
itself to have as a crutch for physicists and technologists. Bur utility
need not imply significance, in any literal linguistic sense. Nor need the
marked success of mathematicians in spinning out theorems, and in find­
ing objective bases for agreement with one an other's results, implY sig­
nificance . For an adequate basis for agreement among mathematicians
can be found simply in the rules which govern the manipulation of the
notations-these syntactical rules being, unlike the notations them­
selves, quite significant and intelligible.')
I have argued that the sort of ontology we adopt can be consequen­
tial-notably in connection with mathematics, although this is only an
example. Now how are we to adjudicate among rival ontologies? Cer­
tainly the answer is not provided by the semantical formula " To be is to
be the value of a variable " ; this formula serves rather, conversely, i n test­
ing the conformity o f a given remark or doctrine to a prior ontological
standard. We look to bound variables in connection with ontology not
in order to know what there is, but in order to know what a given re­
mark or doctrine, ours or someone else's, says there is; and this much is
quite properly a problem involving language. But what there is is an­
other question.
In debating over what there is, there are still reawns for operating on
a semantical plane. One reason is to escape from the predicament noted
at the beginning of this essay: the predicament of my not being able to
admit that there are things which McX countenances and I do not. So
long as I adhere to my ontology, as opposed to McX's, I cannot allow my

bound varia bles to refer to entities which belong to McX's ontology and
not to mine. I can, h owever, consistently describe our disagreement by
cha racterizing the statements which McX affirms. Provided merely that
my ontology countenances linguistic forms, or at least concrete inscrip­
tions and utterances, I can talk a bout McX's sentences.
Another reason for withdrawing to a semantical plane is to find com­
mon ground on which to argue. Disagreement in ontology involves basic
disagreement in conceptual schemes; yet McX and I, despite these basic
disagreements, find that our conceptual schemes converge sufficientlv in
their intermediate and upper ramifications to enable us to communicate
successfu lly on such topics as politics, weather, and, in particular, lan­
guage. In so far as our basic controversv over ontology can be translated
u pward into a semantical controversy about words and what to do with
them, the collapse of the controversy into question-begging may be de­
layed.
It is n o wonder, then, that ontological controversy should tend into
controversy over language. But we must not j ump to the conclusion that
what there is depends on words. Translatability of a question into seman­
tical terms is no indication that the question is linguistic. To see Naples is
to bear a name which, when prefixed to the words 'sees Naples , ' yields a
true sentence; still there is nothing linguistic a hout seeing Naples.
Our acceptance of a n ontology is, I think, similar in principle to our
acceptance of a scientific theory, say a system of physics: we adopt, at
least insofar as we are reasonable, the simplest conceptual scheme into
which the disordered fragments of raw experience can be fitted and ar­
ranged. Our ontology is determined once we have fixed upon the over-all
conceptual scheme which is to accommodate science in the broadest
sense; and the considerations which determine a reasonable construction
of any part of that conceptual scheme, for example, the biological or the
physical part, are not different in kind from the considerations which de­
termine a reasonable construction of the whole. To whatever extent the
adoption of any system of scientific theory may be said to be a matter of
language, the same-but no more-may be said of the adoption of an
ontology.
Bur simplicity, as a guiding principle in constructing conceptual
schemes, is not a clear and unambiguous idea; and it is quite capable of
presenting a double or multiple standard. Imagine, for example, that
we have devised the most economical set of concepts adequate to the
play-by-play reporting of immediate experience. The entities under this
scheme-the values of bound variables-arc, let us suppose, individ-

ual subj ective events of sensation or reflection. We should sti l l find, no
doubt, that a physicalistic conceptual scheme, purporting to talk abom
external obj ects, offers great advantages in simplifying our over-all re­
ports. By bringing together scattered seme events and treating them as
perceptions of one obj ect, we reduce the complexity of our stream of ex­
perience to a manageab l e conceptual simplicity. The rule of simplicity IS
indeed our guiding maxim in assigning sense data to obj ects: we associ­
ate an earlier and a later round sensum with the same so-called penny, or
with two different so-called pennies, in obedience to the demands of
maximum simplicity in our total world-picture.
lIere we have two competing conceptual schemes, a phenomenalistic
one and a physicalistic one. Which should prevail? Each has its advan­
tages; each has its special simplicity in its own way. Each, I suggest, de­
serves to be developed. Each may be said, indeed, to be the more funda­
mental, though in different senses: the one is epistemologically, the other
physically, fundamenta l .
T h e physical conceptual scheme simplifies our account of experience
because of the way myriad scattered sense events come to be associated
with single so-called obj ects; sti ll there is no likelihood that each sen­
tence about physical objects can actually be translated, however deVI­
ously and complexlv, into the phenomenalistic language . Physical ob­
j ect> are postulated entities which round out and simplify our account
of the flux o f experience, just as the introduction of irrational n umbers
simplifies laws of arithmetic. From the point of view of the concep­
tual scheme of the elementary arithmetic of rational numbers alone, the
broader arithmetic of rational and irrational numbers would have the
status of a convenient myth, simpler than the literal truth ( n amely, the
arithmetic of rationals) and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered
part. Similarly, from a phenomenalistic point of view, the conceptual
scheme of physical obj ects is a convenient myth, simpler than the literal
truth and yet containing that literal truth as a scattered parL lll
Now what of classes or attributes of physical obj ects, in turn ? A pla­
tonistic ontology of this sort is, from the point of view of a strictly
physicalistic conceptual scheme, as much a myth as that physicalistic
conceptual scheme itself is for phenomenalism. This higher myth is a
good and useful one, in turn, in so far as it simplifies our acco u nt of
physics. Since mathematics is an integral part of this higher myth, the

The analogy between the myth of mathematics and the myth of phys­
ics is, in some addltlOoal and perhaps fortuitous ways, striki ngly close.
Consider, for ex.lmple, the crisis which was precipitated in the founda­
tions of mathematics, at the turn of the century, by the discovery of Rus­

THE SCOPE AND LANGUA GE O F SCIENCE

I am a phvsical obj ect sitting in a physical world. Some of the forces of
this physical world impinge on mv su rface. Light ravs strike my retinas;
molecules bombard my eardrums and fingertips. I strike back, emanat­
ing concentric air waves. 'fhese waves take the form o f a torrent of dis­
course about tables, people, molecules, light rays, rennas, air waves,
prime numbers, infinite classes, joy and sorrow, good and evil.
My ability to strike back in this elaborate way consists in my having
assimilated a good part o f the culture of my commu n ity, and perhaps
modified and elaborated it a bit on my own account. All this tra ining
consisted in turn of an impinging of physical forces, largely other peo­
ple's utterances, upon my surface, and of gradual changes in my own
constitution consequent upon these physical forces . All I am or ever
hope to be is due to irritations of my surface, together with such latent
tendencies to response as may have been present in my original germ
plasm. And all the lore of the ages is due to i rritation of the surfaces of a
succession of persons, together, again, with the internal initial condinom
of the several individuals.
Now how is it that we know that our knowledge must depend thus
solely on surface irritation and i nternal conditions ' Onlv because we
know i n a general way what the world is like, with its light rays, mole­
cules, men, retinas, and so on. It is thus our very understanding of the
physical world, fragmentary though that understanding be, that enables
us to see how limited the evidence is on which that u nderstanding is
predicated . It is o ur u nderstanding, such as it is, of what lies beyond our
surfaces, that shows our evidence for that understanding to be limited to
our surfaces. But this reflection a rouses cert ain logical misgivings: for is

fury, induced by irritation of our surfaces aod signifying nothing? The
world view which lent plausibilitv to this modest account of our knowl­
edge is, according to this very account of our knowledge, a groundless
fa brication.
To reason thus is, however, to fall into fallacy: a peculiarly philosophi­
cal fal lacy, and one whereof philosophers arc increasingly aware. We
cannot significantly question the reality of the external world, or deny
that there is eVIdence of external objects i n the testimony of our senses;
for, to do so is simply to dissociate the terms 'reality' and 'evidence' from
the very applications which originally did most to invest those terms
with whatever intelligibility they may have for us.
We imbibe an archaic natural philosophy with our mother's milk. In
the fu llness of time, what with catching up on current literature and
making some supplementary observations of our own, we become
clearer on things. But the p rocess is one of growth and gradual change:
we do not break with the past, nor do we attain to standards of evidence
and reality different in kind from the vague standards of children and
laymen. Science is not a substitute for common sense, but an extension
of it. The quest for knowledge is properly an effort simply to broaden
and deepen the knowledge which the man in the street already enjoys, in
moderation, in relation to the commonplace things around him. To dis­
avow the vcry core of comlllon sense, to require evidence for that which
both the physicist and the man in the street accept as platitudinous, i s no
laudable perfectionism; it is a pompous confusion, a failure to observe
the nice distinction between the baby and the bath water.
Let us therefore accept physical reality, whether in the manner of un­
spoiled men in the street or with one or another degree of scientific so­
phistication. I n so doing we constitute ourselves recipients and carriers
of the evolving lore o f the ages. Then, pursuing in detail our thus ac­
cepted theory of physical reality, we draw conclusions concerning, in
parricular, our own physical selves, and even concerning ourselves as
lore bearers. O ne of these conclusions is that this very lore which we are
engaged in has been induced i n us by irritation of our physical surfaces
and not otherwise. I [ere we have a little item of lore about lore. It does
not, if rightly considered, tend to controvert the lore it is about. On the
contrary, our initially uncritical hypothesis of a physical world gains
pragmatic support from whatever it contributes towards a coherent ac­
count of lorebearing or other natural phenomena.
Once we have seen that in our knowledge of the external world we

The Scope and Ldl1guage of Science

have nothing to go on but surface irritation, two questions obtrude
themselvcs�a bad one and a good one. 'rhe bad one, lately dismissed, is
the question whether there is really an external world after all. Tbe good
one is th is: Whence the strength of our notion that there is an external
world? Whence our persistence in representing discourse as somehow
about a reality, and a reality beyond the irritation?
It is not as though the mere occurrence of speech itself were conceived
somehow as prima facie evidence of there being a realitv as suhj ect mat­
ter. Much o f what we say is recognized even hy the man in the street as
irreferential: 'Hello,' 'Thank you,' 'Ho hum: these make no claims upon
reality. These are physical responses on a par, semantically, with the
patellar reflex. Whence then the idea of scientific objectivity ? Whence
the idea that langu age is occasionally descriptive in ,1 way that other
quiverings of irritable protoplasm are not?
This is a question for the natural science of the external world: in par­
ticular, for the psychology of human animals. The question has two not
quite separate parts: whence the insistence on a world of reference, set
over against language ? and whence the insistence on a world of external
objects, set over against oneself? Actually we can proceed to answer this
twofold question plausibly enough, in a general sort of way, without any
very ela borate psychologizing.

Let us suppose that one of the early words acquired by a particular child
is 'red . ' 1I0w does he learn it? lie is treated to utterances of the word si­
multaneously with red presentations; further, Il lS own babbling is ap­
plauded when it approximates to 'red' in the presence o f red. At length
he acquires the art of applying the word neither too narrowly nor too
broadly for his mother's tastes. This learning process is familiar to us un­
der many names: association, conditioning, training, hahit formation,
reinforcement and extinction, induction.
Whatever our colleagues in the l a boratory may discover of the inner
mechanism of that process, we may be sure of this much: the very possi­
bility of it depends on a prior tendency on the child's part to weight qual­
itative differences unequally. Logically, as long as a, b, and c are three
and not one, there is exactly as much difference between (/ and b as be­
tween a and c; j ust as many classes, anyway, divide (/ from b ( i . e . , contain
one and not the other) as a from c. For the child, on the other hand,

195

1 96

Q U I N T E S S E i': C F

some differences must count for more than others if the described pro­
cess of learning 'red' is to go forward at a l l . Whether innately or as a re­
sult of pre-linguistic learning, the child must have more tendency to as­
sociate a red ball with a red ball than with a yellow one; more tendency
to associate a red ball with a red ribbon than with a blue one; and more
tendency to dissociate the ball from its surroundings than to dissociate
its parts from one another. Otherwise no training could mold the child's
usage of the word 'red: since no future occasion would be more strongly
favored by past applications of the word than any other. A working ap­
preciation of something like 'natural kinds: a tendency anyway to re­
spond in different degrees to different differences, has to be there before
the word 'red' can be learned.
At the very beginning of one's learning of language, thus, words arc
learned in relation to such likenesses and contrasts as are already appre­
ciated without benefit of words. No wonder we attribute those like­
nesses and contrasts to real stuff, and think of language as a su perim­
posed apparatus for talking about the real.
The likenesses and contrasts which underlie one's first learning of lan­
guage must not only be pre-verbally appreciable; they must, i n addition,
be intersubjective. Sensitivity to redness will avail the child nothing,
in learning 'red' from the mother, except insofar as the mother is in a po­
sition to appreciate that the child is confronted with something red.
Hence, perhaps, our first glimmerings of an external world. The most
primitive sense of externality mav well be a sense of the mother's rein­
forcement of likenesses and contrasts in the first phases of word learn­
ing. The real is thus felt, first and foremost, as prior to language and ex­
ternal to oneself. It is the stuff that mother vouches for and calls by
nanl C .
T h i s priority of t h e non-linguistic to t h e linguistic diminishes as learn­
ing proceeds. Scholarslllp sets in; i . e . , the kind of learning which de­
pends on prior learning of words, We learn ' mauve' at a n advanced age,
through a verbal formula of the form 'the color of' or 'a color midway
between . ' And the scholarly principle takes hold early; the child will not
have acquired many words before his vocabulary comes to figure as a
major agency in its own increase. fly the time the child is able to sustain
rudimentary conversation in his narrow community, his knowledge of
language and his knowledge of the world arc a u nitary mass.
Nevertheless, we are so overwhelmingly impressed by the initial phase
of o u r education that we continue to think of language generally as a

The Scope a nd Language of SCIence

secondary or superimposed apparatus for talking a bout real things. We
tend not to appreciate that most of the things, and most of the supposed
traits of the so-called world, are learned through language and believed
in by a projection from language. Some uncritical persons arrive thus at
a copy theory of language: they look upon the elements of langllage as
names o f elements of reality, and true discourse as a map of reality. They
proj ect vagaries of language indiscriminately upon the world, stuffing
the universe with ands and ors, singulars and plurals, de finites and in­
definites, facts and states of affairs, simply on the ground that there are
parallel dements and distinctions on the linguistic side.
The general task which science sets itself is that of specifying how real­
ity " really" is: the task o f delineating the structure of reality as distinct
from the struct llre of one or another traditional language (except, of
course, when the science happens to be grammar itself) . The notion
of reality independent of language is carried over by the scientist from
his earliest impressions, bur the facile reification of linguistic features is
avoided or minimized.
But how is it possible for scientists to be thus critical and discriminat­
ing abour their reifications ? If all discourse is mere response to surface ir­
ritation, th e n by what evidence may one man's proj ection of a world be
said to be sounder than another's ? I f, as suggested earlier, the terms 'real­
ity' and 'evidence' owe their intelligibility to their appl ications in archaic
common sense, why may we not then brush aside the presumptions of
science?
The reason we may not is that science is itself a continuation o f com­
mon sense. The scientist is indistinguishable from the common man in
his sense of evidence, except that the scientist is more careful. This in­
creased care is not a revision of evidential standards, but only the more
patient and systematic collection and use of what anyone would deem to
be evidence. If the scientist sometimes overrules something which a su­
perstitious layman might have called evidence, this may simply be be­
cause the scientist has other and contrary evidence which, if patiently
presented to the layman bit by hit, would be conceded superior. O r it
may be that the layman suffers from some careless chain of reasoning of
his own whereby, long since, he came wrongly to reckon certain types of
connection as evidential: wrongly in that a careful survey of his own ill­
observed and long-forgotten steps would suffice to disabuse him. ( A
l i k e l y example is t h e " gambler's fallacy "-the notion that t h e oftener
black pays the likelier red becomes. )

QUINTESSENCE

Not that the layman has an explicit standard of evidence-nor the sci­
entist either. The scientist begins with the primitive sense of evidence
which he possessed as layman, and uses it carefully and systematically.
He still does not reduce it to rule, though he elaborates and uses sundry
statistica l methods in an effort to prevent it from getting out of hand in
complex cases. By putting nature to the most embarrassing tests he can
devise, the scientist makes the most of his lay flair for evidence; and at
the same time he amplifies the flair itself, affixing an artificial proboscis
of punch cards and quadrille paper.
Our latest question was, in brief, how science gets ahead of common
sense; and the a nswer, in a word, is 'system.' The scientist introduces sys­
tem into his quest and scrutiny of evidence. System, moreover, dictates
the scientist's hypotheses themselves: those are most welcome which are
seen to conduce most to simplicity in the overall theory. Predictions,
once they have been deduced from hypotheses, are subj ect to the dis­
cipline of evidence in turn; but the hypotheses have, at the time of hy­
pothesis, only the considerations of systematic simplicity to recommend
them. Insofar, simplicity itself-in some sense of this difficult term­
counts as a kind of evidence; and scientists have indeed long tended to
look upon the simpler of the two hypotheses as not merely the more lik­
able, but the more likely. Let it not be supposed, however, that we have
found at last a type of evidence that is acceptable to science and foreign
to common sense. On the contrary, the favoring of the seemingly sim­
pler hypothesis is a lay habit carried over by science. The quest of sys­
tematic simplicity seems peculiarly scientific in spirit only because sci­
ence is what it issues in.
III

The notion of a reality independent of language is derived from earliest
impressions, if the speculations in the foregoing pages are right, and is
then carried over into science as a matter of course. The stress on exter­
nality is likewise carried over into science, and with a vengeance. For the
sense of externality has its roots, if our speculations arc right, in the
intersubj ectivity which is so essential to the learning of language; and
intersubj ectivity is vital not only to language but equally to the further
enterprise, likewise a social one, of science. All men are to qualify as wit­
nesses to the data of science, and the truths of science are to he true no
matter who pronounces them. Thus it is that science has got on rather

The Scope and Language of Science

with masses and velocities than with likes and dislikes. And thus it i s that
when science does confront likes and dislikes it confronts them as behav­
ior, intersubjectively observable. Language in general is robusrlv extra­
vert, hut science is more so.
It would be unwarranted rationalism to suppose that we can stake out
the business o f science in advance o f pursuing science and arriving at a
certain body of scientific theory. Thus consider, for the sake of analogy,
the smaller t3sk of staking out the business of chemistry. Having got on
with chemistry, we can describe it ex p ost (acto as the studv of the com­
bining of atoms in molecules. But no such clean-cut del imitation o f the
business o f chemistry was possible until that business was already in
large measure done. Now the situation is similar with science generallv.
To describe science as the domain of cognitive j udgment avails us noth­
ing, for the definiens here is in as urgent need of clarification as the
definiendum. Taking advantage of existing scientific work, however, and
not scrupling to identify ourselves with a su bstantive scientific position,
we can then delineate the scientific obj ective, or the cognitive domain, to
some degree. It is a commonplace predicament to he unable to formulate
a task until half done with it.
Thought, if of any considerable complexity, is inseparable from lan­
guage-in practice surely and in principle quite probably. Science,
though it seeks traits of reality independent of language, can neither get
on without language nor aspire to linguistic neutrality. To some degree,
nevertheless, the scientist can enhance ohj ectivity and diminish the inter­
ference of language, by his very choice o f language . And we, concerned
to distill the essence of scientific discourse, can profitably purify the lan­
guage of science bevond what might reasonably be urged upon the prac­
ticing scientist. To such a n operation we now turn.
I n a spirit thus not of practical language reform but of philosophical
schematism, we may begin by banishing what are known as lIuhcator
words ( Goodman) or egocentric tJilrticu/ars ( Russel l ) : 'I,' 'you,' 'this,'
'that; 'here,' 'there,' 'now,' 'then,' and the like. This we clearly must do
if the truths of science are literally to be true independently of author
and occasion of utterance. It is only thus, indeed, that we C0111 e to be
able to speak of sentences, i . e . , certain linguistic forms, as true and false.
As long as the indicator words arc retained, it is not the sentence but
only the several eveots of its utterance that can be said to be trll e or false.
Besides indicator words, a frequent source of fluctuation in point of
truth and falsity is ordinary ambiguity. One and the same sentence, qua

199

200

QUINTESSENCE

linguistic form, may be true in one occurrence and false i n another be­
cause the ambiguity of a word in it is differently resolved by attendant
circumstances on the two occasions. The ambiguous sentence 'Your
mothers bore you' is likely to be construed in one way when it follows
o n the heels of a sentence of the form ' x bore y, ' and in another when it
follows on the heels of a sentence of the form ' x bores y. '
In Indo-European languages there is also yet a third conspicuous
source of fluctuation in point of truth and falsity; viz., tense. Actually
tense is j ust a variant of the phenomenon of indicator words; the tenses
can be paraphrased in terms of tenseless verbs governed by the indicator
word 'now,' or by 'before n ow, ' etc.
How can we avoid indicator word s ? We can resort to personal names
or descriptions in place of 'I' and 'you,' to dates or equivalent descrip­
tions i n place of 'now, ' and to place names or equivalent descriptions in
place of 'here . ' It may indeed be protested that something tantamount to
the use of indicator words is finally unavoidable, at least in the teaching
of the terms which are to be made to supplant the indicator words. But
this is no o bjection; all that matters i s the subsequent avoida bility of in­
dicator words. All that matters is that it be possible in principle to couch
science in a notati on ,uch that none of its sentences fluctuates between
truth and falsity from utterance to utterance. Term, which are primitive
or irreducible, from the point of view of that scientific notation, may still
be intelligible to us only through explanations in an ordinary language
rife with indicator words, tense, and ambiguity. Scientific language is in
any event a splinter of ordinary language, not a su bstitute.
Granted then that we can rid science of indicator words, what would
be the purpose ? A kind of objectivity, to begin with, appropriate to the
aims of science: truth becomes invariant with respect to speaker and oc­
casion. At the same time a technical purpose is served: that of simplify­
ing and facilitating a basic department of science, viz., deductive logic.
For, consider, e.g., the very elementary canons of deduction which lead
from 'p and q' to 'p', and from 'P' to 'p or q,' and from 'p and if p then q'
to 'q'. The letter 'p ' standing for any sentence, turns up twice in each of
these rules; and clearly the rules are unsound if the sentence which we
put for 'p' is capable of being true in one of its occurrences and false in
the other. But to formulate logical laws in such a way as not to depend
thus upon the assumption o f fixed truth and falsity would be decidedly
awkward and complicated, and wholly unrewarding.
In practice certainly one does not explicitly rid one's scientific work of

The Scope Jnd Language ot SClellce

indicator words. tense, and amhigu ity, nor does one limit one\' usc of
l ogic to sentences thus purified. In practice one merely SliPposes all such
points of variation fixed for the space of one's logical argument; one
does not need to resort to explicit paraphrase, except at points where lo­
cal shifts o f context within the logical argument itself threaten equi voca­
tion.
This practical procedure is o ften rationalized hv positing a hstract enti­
ties, 'propoSitions: endowed with all the requisite preCI S10n and fix ity
which is wanting in the sentences themselves; and then saving that it is
with propositi ons, and not thei r coarse sentent i a l embodiments, that the
laws of logic really have to do. But this pm it achieves only ohscurity.
There is less mystery in imagining a n idea l i zed form of SCIentific l a n ­
guage i n which sentences a r e so fashioned as never to vaci l b te hetween
truth and falsity. It is significant that scientific discourse actua l l v docs
tend toward this ideal, in proportion to the degree of development of the
science. Ambiguities and local and epoch al hiases diminish. "jense, In
particular, gives way to a four-dimensional treatment of space-tIme.
IV
A basic form for sentences of science may be represented a s ' hI: where
'a '
stands in place of a singular term referring to some ohJ ect, from
among those which exist according to the scientific theory III question,
and 'I" stands in place of a general term or pred icate. The sentence 'F,,' is
true if and only if the object ful fi l l s the predicate. No tense i, to he read
into the predication ' Fa'; any relevant d a t i n g is to be i ntegr,l l r,uher to
the terms repre,ented bv 'F' and ' a ' .
Compound sentences are built up of such predications w l l h help of fa­
miliar logical connectives and operators: 'and: 'not; th e u n l vc",al quan­
tifier '(x)' ( 'each ohj ect x is such that ' ) , and the existent i a l qu,lIltifier
' ( 3 x ) ' ( 'at least one object x is such that' ) . A n example i s ' ( x ) n o t ( I·x and
not Gx): which says that no object x is such that Fx and not Gx; hriefly,
every F is a G .
A given singular term a n d a given genera l term or predicate w i l l b e
said t o correspond if the general term is true of j ust o n e obj ect, viz., the
object to which the singu l a r term refers. A general term whICh thus cor­
responds to a singular term will o f course he "of singular extc" , i o n , "
i . e . , true of e x,lctiy one object; hur it helongs neverthelc" to t h e gram­
matical category o f general terms, represented by the ' F' rather than the

201

202

Q U I 1': T E S S E N C r

'a' of 'Fa. ' Now the whole category of singular terms can, in the interests
of economy, be swept away i n favor of general terms, viz., the general
terms which correspond to those singular terms. For let 'a' represent any
singular term, '1" any corresponding general term, and ' . . . a . . . ' any
sentence we may have cared to affirm containing 'a'. Then we may in­
stead dispense with 'a' and affirm ' ( 3x) ( Fx and . . . x . . . ) . ' Clearly this
will be true if and only if ' . . . a . . . ' was true. If we want to go on explic­
itly to remark that the obj ect fulfilling 'F' is unique, we can easily do that
too, thus:
(x)(y) not I Fx and J.y and not (x = y)J
provided that the identity sign ' =' is in our vocabulary.
How, it may be asked, can we be sure there will be a general term cor­
responding to a given singular term ? The matter can be viewed thus: we
merely rcparse what had been singular terms as general terms of singular
extension, and what had been reference-to as truth-of, and what had
been ' . . . a . . . ' as ' ( 3x) ( Fx and . . . x . . . ) . ' If the old singular term was a
proper name learned by ostension, then it is reparsed as a general term
similarly learned.
The recent reference to ' = ' comes a s a reminder that relative general
terms, or polyadic predicates, must be allowed for along with the mo­
nadic ones; i . e . , the atomic sentences of our regimented scientific lan­
guage will comprise not only 'Fx: 'Fy,' ' Gx,' etc., but also 'Hxy,' 'Hzx, '
'Jyz: 'Kryz,' and the like, for appropriately i nterpreted predicates 'F',
'G', 'H', T, 'K', etc. (whereof 'H' might i n particular be i nterpreted as
' = ' ) . The rest of the sentences are built from these atomic ones by 'and,'
' not,' ' (x),' '(y): etc. Singular terms 'a', 'b', etc . , can, we have seen, be left
out of account. So can the existential quantifiers ' ( 3x),' '(3y),' etc., since
' ( 3 x ) ' can be paraphrased 'not (x) not. '
Besides simple singular terms there are operators to reckon with, such
as ' + ' , which yield complex singular terms such as 'x + y. ' But it is not
difficult to see how these can be got rid of i n favor of corresponding
polyadic predicates-e.g., a predicate 'I' such that ' LZXY ' means that z is
x + y.
This pattern for a scientific language is evidently rather confining.
There are no names of obj ects . Further, no sentences occur within sen­
tences save i n contexts of conj unction, negation, and quantification. Yet
it suffices very generally as a medium for scientific theory. Most or all of

The Scope and Language of Science

what is likely to be wanted in a science can be fitted into this form, by
dint of constructions of varying ingenuity which arc familiar to logic stu­
dents. To take only the most trivial and familiar example, consider the
'if-then' idiom; it can be managed by rendering 'if p then q' as 'not (II
and not q ) . '
It m a y be instructive t o dwell o n this example for a moment. Notori­
ously, 'not (p and not q)' is no translation of 'if p then q'; and it need not
pretend to be. The point is merely that in the places where, at least in
mathematics and other typical scientific work, we would ordinarily use
the 'if-then' construction, we find we can get on perfectly well with the
su bstitute form 'not (p and not q),' sometimes eked out with a universal
quantifier. We do not ask whether our reformed idiom constitutes a gen­
uine semantical analysis, somehow, of the old idiom; we simply find our­
selves ceasing to depend on the old idiom in our technical work. Here we
see, in paradigm, the contrast hetween linguistic analysis and theory
construction.
v

The variables 'x', 'y', etc . , adj uncts to the notation of quantification,
bring about a widening of the notion of sentence . A sentence which con­
tains a variable without its quantifier ( e . g . , 'i'x' or ( y ) Fx y lacking ' ( x ) ' )
is n o t a sentence in t h e ordinary true-or-false sense; it is true for some
values of its free variables, perhaps, and false for others. Called an ollen
sentence, it is akin rather to a predicate: instead of having a truth value
( truth or falsity) it may be said to have an extension, this heing conceived
as the class of those evaluations of its free variables for which it is true.
For convenience one speaks also of the extension of a closed sentence,
but what is then meant is simply the truth value.
A compound sentence which contains a sentence as a component
clause is called an extensional context of that component sentence i f,
whenever you supplant the component by any sentence with the same
extension, the compound remains unchanged in point of its own exten­
sion. In the special case where the sentences concerned arc closed sen­
tences, then, contexts are extensional if all substitutions of truths for
true components and falsehoods for false components leave true con­
texts true and false ones false. In the case of closed sentences, in short,
extensional contexts are what are commonly known as truth functions.
It is well known, and easily seen, that the conspicuously limited means
'

,'

203

204

QUINTESSENCF

which we have lately allowed ourselves for compounding sentences­
viz., 'and; 'not,' and quantifiers-are capable of generating only exten­
sional contexts. It turns out, on the other hand, that they confine us no
more than that; the only ways of emhedding sentences within sentences
which ever obtrude themselves, and resist analysis by 'and; 'not; and
quantifiers, prove to be contexts of other than extensional kind. It will
be instructive to survey them.
Clearly quotation is, by our standards, non-extensional; we cannot
freely put truths for truths and falsehoods for falsehoods within quota­
tion, without affecting the truth value of a broader sentence whereof the
quotation forms a part. Quotation, however, is always dispensable in fa­
vor of spelling. Instead, e.g., of:
Heraclitus said ';ravra {)fl',
';ravTU pEL ' contains three syllables,
we can say ( following Tarsk i ) :
Heraclitus said pi-alph a-nu-tau-alpha -space-rho-epsilon-iota,
and correspondingly for the other example, thus availing ourselves of
names of letters together with a hyphen by way of concatenation sign.
Now, whereas the quotational version showed a sentence ( the Greek
one) embedded within a sentence, the version based on spelling docs not;
here, therefore, the question of extensionality no longer arises.
Under either version, we arc talking about a certain obj ect-a linguis­
tic form-with help, as usual, of a singular term which refers to that ob­
j ect. Quotation produces one singular term for the purpose; spelling an­
other. Quotation is a kind of picture-writing, convenient in practice; but
it is rather spelling that provides the proper analysis for purposes of the
logical theory of signs.
We saw lately that singular terms are never finally needed. The singu­
lar terms involved in spelling, in particular, can of course finally be elimi­
nated in favor of a n otation of the sort envisaged in recent pages, in
which there are just predicates, quantifiers, variables, 'and; and 'not.'
The hyphen of concatenation then gives way to a triadic predicate analo­
gous to the ' L ' of § IV, and the singular terms 'pi; 'alpha; etc., give way
to general terms which " correspond" to them in the sense of § IV.
A more seriously non-extensional context is indirect discourse: " Her­
aclitus said that all is flux. " This is not, like the case of quotation, a sen-

The Scope <l n d Language of Science

tence a bout a specific and namable lingu istic form. Perhaps, contrarv to
the line putsued in the case o f quotation, we must accept indirect dis­
course as involving an irreducibly non-extensional occurrence of one
sentence in another. If so, then indirect discourse resists the schematism
lately put forward for scientific language.
It is the more interesting, then, to reflect that indirect discourse is in
any event at variance with the characteristic obj ectivity of science. It is a
subj ective idiom. Whereas quotation reports an external event of speech
or writing by an obj ective description of the observable written shape or
spoken sound, on the other hand indirect discourse reports the event in
terms rather of a subjective projection of oneself into the imagined state
of mind of the speaker or writer in question. Indirect discourse is quota­
tion minus o bj ectivitv and precision. To marshal the evidence for imli­
rect discourse is to revert to quotation .
It is significant that the latitude of paraphrase allowable in indirect
discourse has never been fixed; and it is more significant that the need of
fixing it is so rarely felt. To fix it would be a scientific Ill o ve, and a scien­
tifically unmotivated one in that indirect discourse tends away frolll the
very obj ectivity which science seeks.
Indi rect discourse, in the standard form 'savs that; is the head of a
family which includes also 'believes that: 'doubts that,' 'is surprised
that,' 'wishes that,' 'strives that,' and the like. The subjectivity noted in
the case of 'says that' is shared by these other idioms twice over; for
what these describe in terms of a suhj ective projection of oneself is not
even the protagonist'S speech behavior, but his s u bj ective state in turn.
Further cases of non-extensional idiom, outside the immediate family
enumerated above, are ' because' and the closely related phenomenon of
the contrary-to- fact conditional. Now it is an ironical but familiar fact
that though the business of science is descri bable in unscientific language
as the discovery of causes, the notion of cause itself has no firm place in
science. The disappearance of causal terminol ogv from the j argon of one
branch of science and another has seemed to mark the progress in under­
standing of the branches conceroed.
Apart from actual quotation, therefore, which we have seen how to
deal with, the various familiar non-extensional idioms tend away from
what best typifies the scientific spirit. Not that they should or could be
generally avoided in everyday discourse, or even in science broadly so­
called; but their use dwindles in proportion as the statements of science
3 re made more explicit and obj ective. We begin to see how it is that the

20S

206

QUINTESSENCE

language form schematized in § JV might well, despite its narrow limita­
tions, suffice for science at its purest.
VI

Insofar as we adhere to that idealized schematism, we think of a science
as comprising those truths which are expressible in terms of 'and,' 'not,'
quantifiers, variables, and certain predicates appropriate to the science
in question. I n this enumeration of materials we may seem to have an ap­
proximation to a possihle standard of what counts as " purely cogni­
tive . " But the standard, for all its seeming strictness, is still far too flexi­
ble. To specify a science, within the described mold, we still have to say
what the predicates are to be, and what the domain of objects is to be
over which the variables of quantification range . Not all ways of settling
these details will be congenial to scientific ideals.
Looking at actual science as a going concern, we can fix in a general
way on the domain of obj ects. Physical obj ects, to begin with-deni­
zens of space-time--clearly belong. This category embraces indiscrimi­
nately what would anciently have heen distinguished as substances and
as modes or states of substances. A man is a four-dimensional obj ect, ex­
tending say eighty-three years in the time dimension. Each spatio-tempo­
ral part of the man counts as another and smaller four-dimensional ob­
j ect. A president-elect is one such, two months long. A fit of ague is
another, if for ontological clarity we identify it, as we conveniently may,
with its victim for the duration of the seizure.
Contrary to popular belief, such a physical ontology has a place also
for states of mind. An inspiration or a hallucination can, like the fit of
ague, be identified with its host for the duration . The feasibility of this
artificial i dentification of any mental seizure, x, with the corresponding
time slice x ' of its physical host, may be seen by reflecting on the follow­
ing simple maneuver. Where P is any predicate which we might want to
apply to x, let us explain P' as true of x ' if and only if P is true of x .
Whatever Ill a y have been looked upon as evidence, cause, or conse­
quence of P, as applied to x, counts now for P' as applied to x ' . This par­
allelism, taken together with the extensionality of scientific language, en­
a hles us to drop the old P and x from our theory and get on with j ust P '
and x ' , rechristened as P and x. Such, in effect, is the identification. It
leaves our mentalistic idioms fairly intact, but reconciles them with a
physical ontology.

The Scope and Language of Science

This facile physicalization of states of mind rests i n no way on a the­
ory of parallelism between nerve impulses, say, or chemical concentra­
tions, and the recurrence of predetermined species o f mental state. It
might be, now and forever, that the only way of guessing whether a man
is inspired, or depressed, or deluded, or in pain, is by asking him or by
o bserving his gross behavior; not by examining his nervous workings, al­
beit with instruments o f undreamed-of subtletv. Discoverv of the sug­
gested parallelism would be a splendid scientific achievement, but the
physicalization here talked of does not require it.
This physicalization does not, indeed, suffice to make 'inspiration,'
'hallucination,' 'pain,' and other mentalistic terms accepta b l e to science .
Though these become concrete general terms applicable to physical ob­
j ects, viz., time slices of persons, still they may, some or others of them,
remain too vague for scientific utility. Disposition terms, and other pred­
icates which do not lend themselves to immediate ve rification, arc by no
means unallowable as such; but there are better and worse among them.
When a time slice of a person is to be classified under the head of inspira­
tion or hallucination, and when not, may have been left too unsettled for
any useful purpose. But what is then at stake is the accepta bility of cer­
tain predicates, and not the acceptability of certai n obj ects, values of
variables of quantification.
Let us not leave the latter topic quite yet: ontology, or the values avail­
able to variables. As seen, we can go far with physical objects. They arc
not, however, known to suffice. Certainly, as j ust now argued, we do not
need to add mental obj ects. But we do need to add ahstract obj ects, if
we are to accommodate science as currently constituted. Certain things
we want to say in science may compel us to admit into the range of val­
ues of the variables of quantification not only physical objects but also
classes and relations of them; also numbers, functions, and other obj ects
of pure mathematics. ror, mathematics-not un interpreted mathemat­
ics, but genuine set theory, logic, number theory, algebra of real and
complex numbers, differential and integral calcu lus, and so on-is best
looked upon as an integral part of science, on a par with the physics,
economics, etc., in which mathematics is said to recei,'c its applications.
Researches in the foundations o f mathematics have made it clear that
all of mathematics in the a bove sense can be got down to logic and set
theory, and that the objects needed for mathematics in this sense can
be got down to a single category, that of classes-including classes of
classes, classes of classes of classes, and so on. Our tentative ontology for

207

20S

QUINTESSENCE

science, our tentative range of values for the variables of quantification,
comes therefore to this: physical obj ects, classes of them, classes in turn
of the elements of this combined domain, and so on up.
We have reached the present stage in our characterization of the scien­
tific framework not by reasoning a priori from the nature of science qua
science, but rather by seizing upon traits of the science of our day. Spe­
cial traits thus exploited include the notion of physical obj ect, the fo ur­
dimensional concept of space-time, the classial mold of modern classical
mathematics, the true-false orientation of standard logic, and indeed
extensionality itself. One or another of these traits might well change as
science advances. Already the notion of a physical object, as a n intrinsi­
calIy determinate portion of the space-time continuum, squares dubi­
ously with modern developments in quantum mechanics. Savants there
are who even suggest that the findings of quantum mechanics might best
be accommodated by a revision of the true-false dichotomy itself.
To the question, finally, of admissible predicates. In general we may be
sure that a predicate will lend itself to the scientific enterprise only if it is
relatively free from vagueness in certain crucial respects . I f the predicate
is one which is mainly to be used in application to the macroscopic ob­
j ects of common sense, then there is obvious utility in there being a gen­
eral tendency to agreement, among ohservers, concerning its application
to those obj ects; for it is in such applications that the intersubjective
verifiability of the data of science resides. In the case of a predicate which
is mainly applica ble to scientific obj ects remote from observation or
common sense, on the other hand, what is required is that it be free
merely from such vagueness as might blur its theoretical function. But to
say these things is merely to say that the predicates appropriate to sci­
ence are those which expedite the purposes of intersubjective confirma­
tion and theoretical clarity and simplicity. These same purposes govern
also the ontological decision-the determination of the range of quan­
tification; for clearly the present tentative ontologv of physical ohj ects
and classes will be abandoned forthwith when we find an alternative
which serves those purposes better.
In science all is tentative, all admits of revision-right down, as we
have noted, to the law of the excluded middle. But ontology is, pending
revision, more clearly in hand than what may be called ideoloKy-the
question of admissible predicates. We have found a tentative ontology in
physical obj ects and classes, but the lexicon of predicates remains decid­
edly open. That the ontology should be relatively definite, pending revi-

The Scope and Language of Science

sion, is required by the mere presence of quantifiers in the language of
science; for quantifiers may be said to have been interpreted and under­
stood only insofar as we have settled the range of their variables. And
that the fund of predicates should be forever subj ect to supplementation
is implicit in a theorem of mathematics; for it is known that for any the­
ory, however rich, there are classes which are not the extensions (d. §V)
of any of its sentences.

I t is n o t t o be wondered that theory makers seek simplicity. When two
theories are equally defensible on other counts, certainly the simpler of
the two is to be preferred on the score of both beauty and convenience.
But what is remarkable is that the simpler of two theories is generally re­
garded not only as the more desirable but also as the more probable. If
two theories conform equally to past observations, the simpler of the
two is seen as standing the better chance of confirmation in future obser­
vations. Such is the maxim of the simplicity of nature. It seems to be im­
plicitly assumed in every extrapolation and interpolation, every drawing
of a smooth curve through plotted points. And the maxim of the unifor­
mity of natute is of a piece with it, u niformity being a species of sim­
plicity.
Simplicity is not easy to define. But it may be expected, whatever it is,
to be relative to the texture of a conceptual scheme. I f the basic concepts
of one conceptual schema are the derivative concepts of another, and
vice versa, presumably one of two hypotheses could count as simpler for
the one scheme and the other for the other. This being so, how can sim­
plicity carry any peculiar presumption of obj ective truth ? Such is the im­
plausibility of the maxim of the simplicity of nature.
Corresponding remarks apply directly to the maxim of the uniformity
of nature, according to which, vaguely speaking, things similar in some
respects tend to prove similar in others. For again similarity, whatever it
is, would seem to be relative to the structure of one's conceptual scheme
or quality space. Any two things, after all, are shared as members by as
many classes as any other two things; degrees of similarity depend on
which of those classes we weight as the more basic or natural.
Belief in the simplicity of nature, and hence i n the uniformity of na­
ture, can be partially accounted for in obvious ways. One plausible fac210

On Simple Theories of a Complex World

tor is wishful thinking. Another and more compelling cause of the belief
is to be found in our perceptual mechanism: there is a subj ective selectiv­
ity that makes us tend to see the simple and miss the complex. Thus con­
sider streamers, as printers call them: vertical or diagonal white paths
formed by a fortuitous lining up of the spaces hetween words. They are
always straight or gently curved. The fastidious typesetter makes them
vanish j ust by making them c[(Joked.
This snbj ective selectivity is not limited to the perceptual level. It can
figure even in the most deli berate devising of experimental criteria. Thus
suppose we try to map out the degrees of mutual affinity of stimuli for a
dog, by a series of experiments in the conditioning and extinction of his
responses. Suppose further that the resulting map is challenged: suppose
someone protests that what the map reflects is not some original spacing
of qualities in the dog's pre-experimental psyche or original fund of dis­
positions, but only a history of readj ustments induced successively by
the very experiments of the series. Now how would we rise to this chal­
lenge ? O hviously, by repeatiog the experiments in a different order on
another dog. If we get much the same map for the second dog despite the
permutation, we have evidence that the map reflects a genuinely pre-ex­
perimental pattern of dispositions. And we then have evidence also of
something more: that this pattern or quality space is the same for both
dogs. But now I come to the point of my example: we cannot, by this
method, get evidence of pre-experimental quality spaces unlike for the
two dogs. By the very nature of our criterion, in this example, we get evi­
dence either of uniformity or of nothing. An analysis of experimental cri­
teria in other sciences would no doubt reveal many further examples of
the same sort of experimentally imposed bias in favor of uniformity, or
in favor of simplicity of other sorts.
This selective bias affords not only a partial explanation of belief in
the maxim of the simplicity of nature but a l so, in an odd way, a partial
j ustification. For, if our way of framing criteria is such as to preclude,
frequently, any confirmation of the more complex of two rival hypothe­
ses, then we may indeed fairly say that the simpler hypothesis stands the
better chance o f confirmation; and such, precisely, was the maxim of the
simplicity of nature. We have, insofar, j ustified the maxim while still
avoiding the paradox that seemed to he involved in trying to reconcile
the relativity of simplicity with the a hsoluteness of truth.
This solution, however, is too partial to rest with. The selective bias in
favor of simplicity, in our perceptual mechanism and in our deliberate
experimental criteria, is significant but not overwhelming. Complex hy-

Q U I NTESSENC E

potheses do often stand as live options, j ust as suscepti ble to experimen­
tal confirmation as their simpler alternatives; and in such cases still the
maxim of simplicity continues to be applied in scientific practice, with as
much intuitive plausibility as in other cases. We fit the simplest possible
curve to plotted points, thinking it the likeliest curve pending new points
to the contrary; we encompass data with a hypothesis involving the few­
est possible parameters, thinking this hypothesis the likeliest pending
new data to the contrary; and we even record a measurement as the
roundest near number, pending repeated measurements to the contrary.
Now this last case, the round number, throws further light on our
problem. If a measured quantity is reported first as 5 . 2 1 , say, and more
accurately in the light of further measurement as 5 . 2 3 , the new reading
supersedes the old; but if it is reported first as 5.2 and later as 5 . 2 3 , the
new reading may well be looked upon as confirming the old one and
merely supplying some further information regarding the detail of fur­
ther decimal places. Thus the " simpler hypothesis , " 5.2 as against 5 . 2 1 ,
is quite genuinely t e n times likelier t o b e confirmed, j ust because ten
times as much deviation is tolerated under the head of confirmation.
True, we do not customarily say " simple hypothesis " in the round­
number case. We invoke here no maxim of the simplicity of nature, but
only a canon of eschewing insignificant digits. Yet the same underlying
principle that operates here can be detected also in cases where one does
talk of simplicity of hypotheses. If we encompass a set of data with a hy­
pothesis involving the fewest possible parameters, and then are con­
strained by further experiment to add another parameter, we are likely
to view the emendation not as a refutation of the first result but as a con­
firmation plus a refinement; but if we have an extra parameter in the first
hypothesis and are constrained by further experiment to alter it, we view
the emendation as a refutation and revision. Here again the simpler hy­
pothesis, the one with fewer parameters, is initially the more probable
simply because a wider range of possible subsequent findings is classified
as favorable to it. The case of the simplest curve through plotted points
is similar: a n emendation prompted by subsequent findings is the likelier
to be viewed as confirmation-cum-refinement, rather than as refutation
and revision, the simpler the curve. I

On Simple Theories of a Complex World

We have noticed four causes for supposing that the simpler hypothe­
sis stands the better chance of confirmation. There is wishful thinking.
There is a perceptual bias that slants the data in favor of simple patterns.
There is a bias in the experimental criteria of concepts, whereby the sim­
pler of two hypotheses is sometimes opened to confirmation while its al­
ternative is left inaccessible. And finally there is a preferential system of
scorekeeping, which tolerates wider deviations the simpler the hypothe­
sis. These last two of the four causes operate far more widely, I suspect,
than appears on the surface. Do they operate widely enough to account
in full for the crucial role that simplicity plays in scientific method ?

4 8 . Nominalism and Realism '

One finds or can imagine disagreement on whether there arc wombats,
unicorns, angels, neutrinos, classes, points, miles, propositions. Philoso­
phy and the special sciences afford infinite scope for disagreement on
what there is. One such issue that has traditionally divided philoso­
phers is whether there are abstract obj ects. Nominalists have held that
there are not; realists ( in a special sense of the word ) , or Piatonists (as
they have been called to avoid the troubles of 'realist' ), have held that
there are.
General definition of the term 'abstract,' or 'universal,' and its oppo­
site 'concrete,' or 'particular,' need not detain us.' No matter if there are
things whose status under the dichotomy remains enigmatic-" abstract
particulars " such as the Equator and the North Pole, for instance; for no
capital will be made of the dichotomy as such. It will suffice for now to
cite classes, attributes, propositions, numbers, relations, and functions
as typical abstract objects, and physical obj ects as concrete obj ects par
excellence, and to consider the ontological issue as it touches such typi­
cal cases.
That more confidence should be felt in there being physical obj ects
than in there being classes, attributes, and the like is not to be wondered.
For one thing, terms for physical objects belong to a more basic stage in

our acquisition of language than abstract terms do. Concrete reference is
felt as more secure than a bstract reference because i t is more deeply
rooted in our formative past. For another thing, terms for intersub­
j ectively observable physical things are at the focu s of the most suc­
cessful of unprepared communication, as between strangers in the mar­
ketplace. Surely such rapport tends to encourage confidence, h owever
unconsciously, that one is making no mistake about his objects. 'fhird,
our terms for physical obj ects are commonly learned through fairly di­
rect conditioning to stimulatory e ffects of the denoted objects. The em­
pirical evidence for such physical objects, if not immediate, is at any rate
less far-fetched and so less suspect than that for objects whose terms are
learned only in deep context. Note that whereas the fi rst two causes for
relative confidence in physical obj ects were causes only, this third one is
a defensible reason.
Defensible but still contestable, on two counts: that it makes no case
for physical obj ects of highly inferential sorts, and that it makes yet more
of a case for sense data or sense qualities than for physical o b j ects. N ow
the former of these two objections might be answered by appeal to conti­
nuity. If some physical objects are better attested than any abstract ones,
then other and more conjectural physical objects are likewise more to be
welcomed than a bstract ones, because their acceptance along with those
well-attested objects entails less loss of homogeneity, hence less loss of
simplicity (caeteris paribus), than would acceptance of the abstract ob­
j ects.
The other obj ection, insofar as it champions sense data in the sense of
concrete sensory events ( as against recurrent qualities ) , is an obj ection at
most to physicalism and not to nominalism. But no matter; the l i kely re­
j oinder to the obj ection is independent of whether the subjective sensory
objects envisaged are events o r qualities. It is that no sufficient purpose is
served by positing subj ective sensory o bj ects. This rejoinder would need
sustaining on perhaps three counts, as follows, corresponding to three
real or fancied purposes of positing such obj ects. (a) It would be argued
that we cannot h ope to make such obj ects suffice to the excl usion of
physical obj ects. This point, urged in § 1 , seems pretty widely acknowl­
edged nowadays. (b) It would he argued ( against Roderick Firth, for in­
stance ) that we do not need them in addition to physical o bj ects, as
means e.g. of reporting illusions and uncertainties. Thus one might claim
that such purposes are adequately met by a propositional-attitude con­
struction in which 'seems that' or the like is made to govern a subsidiary

sen tence about physical objects. One might claim that special obj ects of
illusion are then no more called for than peculiar non-physical obj ects of
quest or desire were called for in § 32 . True, this argument is threatened
by our high line on propositIOnal attitudes in § §45 and 47; but perhaps
appearance deserves no better, after all, than the demil1umdam status ac­
corded to propositional attitudes generally. ( e ) It w o u l d b e argued that
we also do not need sensory obj ects to acco unt for our knowledge or dis­
course of physica l ohJects themselves. The c13im here would be that the
relevance of sensory stim u l ation to sentences a bout physical obj ects can
as well ( a n d bette rl be explored and explained in terms directlv of the
cond itioni ng of such sentences or their parts to physical irritations of the
subj ect's surfaces. Interve n i ng neural activity goes on, but the claim is
that nothmg is c l.Hificd, nothmg but excess baggage is added, by positing
intermediary subjective obj ects of apprehension anterior to the physical
obj ects overtly alleged in the spoken sentences themselves. The supposed
function of seme-datum reports, in contributing a component of some­
thing like certa inty to the formulations of empirical knowledge, may
more realistica lly be assigned to observation sentences in the sense of
§ 1 0 . These enjov a privi leged evidential position, in the directness of
their correlation with non-verbal stimulation; yet they arc not, typically,
about seme data .
Points (ai, ( h i , a n d ( e ) reflect mv own general attitu de. What perhaps
basicallv distingUishes this from the attitude of sense-datum philoso­
phers is that I favor treating cognition from within our own e volving
theory of a cognized world, not fancving that firmer ground exists some­
how outside all that. However, such cursory remarks as these on the phi­
losophy of senst' data can aspire at most to sort out issues and sketch a
position; not to per'llade . ;
Let us n o w locate a l l this i n its immediate context. What h a d been

j ects nor are needed i n addition. Now here we begin to witness the colli­
sion of two standards. Comparative directness of association with sen­
sory stimulation was counted in favor of physical objects, but then we
raised against the sense dara themselves a ,ecund standard: util ity for
theory. Does one then have simply to weigh opposing consideration s ?
N o ; on maturer reflection t h e picture changes. F o r l e t u s recall t h e pre­
dicament in radical translation, which showed that a full knowledge of
the stimulus meaning of a n observation sentence is not sufficient for
translating o r even spotting a term. In our own language, by the same to­
ken, the stim ulus meaning of an obse rvati o n sentence i n no way settles
whether any part of the sentence should be disti nguished as a term for
seme dara, or as a term for physical objects, or as a term at a l l . How di­
rectly the sentence and its words are associated with sensory stimulation,
or how confidently the sentence may be affirmed on the strength of a
given sensory stimulation, does not settle whether to posit obj ects of one
sort or a nother for words of the sentence to dmote i n the capacity of
terms.
We may be perceived to have posited the obj ects only when we have
brought the contemplated terms into suitable interplay with the whole
distinctively ohj ectificatory apparatus of our language: articles and pro­
nouns and tbe idioms of identity, plurality, and predication, or, in canon­
ical notation, quantification. Even a superficia lly termhke occurrence is
no proof of termhood, failing sYstematic interplay with the key idioms
generally. 'rhu s we habitually say ' for the sake of,' with 'sake' seemingly
in term position, and never thereby convict ourseh'es of positing any
such obj ects as sakes, for we do not bring the rest of the apparatus to
bear: we never use 'sake' as antecedent of ' it; nor do we predicate 'sake'
of anything. 'Sake' figures in effect as an invariable fragment of a prepo­
sition ' for the sake of,' or 'for 's sake.'
Let a word, therefore, have occurred as a fragmen t of ever so many
empirica lly wel l-attested sentential wholes; even as a rather teflnlike
fragment, by superficial appearances. Still, the question whether to treat
it as a term is the question whether to give it general access to positions
appropriate to general terms, or perhaps to singular terms, s u bject to the
usual l aws of such contexts. Whether to do so Ill a y rcasonahly be de­
cided by considerations of systematic cfficdcy, utility for theory.
But if nominalism and realism arc to be a d j udicated o n such grounds,
nominalism's claims dwindle. The reason for admitting n u m hers as ob­
jects is precisely their efficacy in organizing and expediti ng the sciences.

217

218

Q U l i': T E S S E i': C E

The reason for admitting classes is much the same. Examples have been
noted ( § 4 3 \ of t h e access of power that comes with classes. A further ex­
ample is Frege's celebrated definition of 'x is ancestor of y ' :

(z ) ( if all parents of members of z belong to z and y
then x c z ) .

fZ

Simplicity ensues, since w e a r e spared separate, piecemeal provision for
the things that classes provide. The efficacy of classes becomes yet more
impressive when we find that they can be made to serve the purposes
also of a great lot of further abstract obj ects of undeniable utility: rela­
tions, functions, n umbers themselves ( § § 5 3-S S ) .
We gain a perhaps more fundamental insight into the unifying force of
the class concept when we observe how classes help us get by with
quantifiers as the sole variable-binding operators. Thus think of . . . z
. . . ' as some open sentence . Concretion4 is the transformation that car­
ries 'x E- i( . . . z . . . )' into ' . . . x . . , ' , Ncnv let '$,/ represent some vari­
a ble-binding operator that builds sentences from sentences. I f we sup­
pose merely that '<p! is such that the substitutivity of concretion holds
under it, we can drop '<P,' in favor of a general term ' G ' . For, take ' G ' as
true of j ust the classes y such that <P,(x E y ) ; then <p ( . . . x . . . )' can be
rendered 'Gx( . . . x . . . ).' Finally the operator of class abstraction in
' Gx( . . . x . . . 1 ' can be reduced to description, and description to quan­
tifiers. ( Cf. § § 34, 3 8 . But see also § S S . )
Closeness of association with stimulation h a s stood u p poorly as a n
argument for giving physical obj ects preferential status. But something
could still perhaps be salvaged from it. For, grant that the question
whether to dignify given words as terms is a question whether to admit
them freely to all term positions. Then instead of what was said earlier
for physical obj ects, viz. that terms for them are fairly directly associated
with sensory stimulation, perhaps we could say this: sentences fairly di­
rectly associated with sensory stimulation exhihit term s for physical ob­
j ects in all sorts of term positions, not j ust in rather special positions. It
seems plausible that common terms for physical obj ects come out better
by such a standard than abstract terms d o . ' But I shall not try to estab­
lish the point.

Ontlc f)cci�ion

The case that emerged meanwhile for classes rested on systematic
efficacy. Now it is certainly a case against nominalism's negative claims,
hut still it is no case against a preferential status for physical objects. In a
contest for sheer systematic utility to science, the notion of physical ob­
j ect still leads the field .' On this score alone, therefore, one might still put
a premium on explanations that appeal to physical obj ects and not to
a bstract ones, even if abstract obj ects be grud!(ingly admitted too for
their efficacy elsewhere in the theory.
Nor let us scorn those two earlier causes for confidence in physical ob­
j ects-the causes that were not recognized as reasons. One was that
terms for such o hj ects are so hasic to our language; the other was that
they are at the focus of such successful communication . 'Ii) show why
certain terms are felt as comfortable termini of explanation is not, after
all, to render them otherwise.
49. False Predilections, Ontic C o m mitment

We have considered the predilection for concrete objects and the case,
despite such predilection, for admitting abstract objects. For symmetry
let us now ponder the positive predi lection for a bstract objects; for it is
not unknown.
An apparent reason for favoring physical objects was proximity to
stimulation. This seemed all the more reason for favoring sensory ob­
j ects of some sort, even sense qualities. Then, if attributes generally are
held to be broadly analogous to sense qualities ( a s are the inferential par­
ticles of physics to common-sense bodies ) , the same appeal to continuity
can be made in support of attributes as was made in support of the parti­
cles ( § 4 8 ) . lIere, I think, is one cause of the predilection that i s some­
times manifested for attributes.
Not that I accept the line of reasoning. That argument for sensory ob­
jects is offset, as urged in §48, if we hold that such obj ects are neither ad­
equate in lieu of physical objects nor helpful in addition to them. More­
over, to proj ect non-sensory attributes purely o n the analogy of sense
qualities, hence as recurrent characters somehow of a suhj ective show
within the mind, betrays surely a cavalier attitude toward psychological
processes and a lack of curiosity ahout the mechanisms of behavior.
Such is one likely cause of a predilection for attributes ( a part from
motives of systematic utility) . 'fhere is also a second. Some of us arc car6. See P. f. Stfmvson, IndIVtduals ( London: !vlethuen, 1 95 9 ) ,

ried away by the obj ect-directed pattern of our thinking, to the point of
seeking the gist of every sentence in things it is about. When a general
term occurs predicatively a longside a name, the sentence thus formed
will be seen by such a person as 'a hout' not j ust the named o hject, but
the named ohj ect and a n attrih ute symholized by the general term. - He
will feel therefore that any general term for physical ohjects, such as
'round' or 'dog,' simultaneously symbolizes an attrihute. But then, he
will reason, any a rgument for physical ohj ects from the utility of such
terms m llst, ipso facto, support attri butes as well and even better; for the
terms neatly symbolize one precise attribute apiece, while standing in no
s lIch pat correspondence to the indefinitely n u merous physical obj ects
that they purport to be true of. ( Much the same argument can be used
also to support classes instead of attributes, since a general term can as
well be said to symbolize its extension as its intension if we appropri­
ately shade the sense of 'symbolize . ' )
In this reasoning t h e mistake i s n o t j ust the initial o n e of overdoing the
object matter. There is a subsequent fallacy in the idea that the utility of
a word counts, of itself, in favor of all associated objects. A word can
prove useful in such positions as to favor the assumption of obj ects for it
to be true of, without therehy favoring the assumption of obj ects related
to it in other ways, e . g . , as extension or i ntension. Let u s rellect on the
mechanism.
Typical of the positions proper to general terms arc the post articular
and the predicative. 'rhe one position is contained in singular terms; the
other accompanies singular terms ( which can be varia bles ) . These singu­
lar terms in turn are ma rked as singular terms by their occurrences as
subj ects of other predicativcly occurring general terms, notably ' = ', and
in variable-binding operators. And where do ohj ects come i n ? The pur­
ported obj ects of whatever son, concrete or abstract, are j ust what the

singular terms in their several ways name, refer to, take as values.' They
are what count as cases when, quantifying, we say that everything, or
something, is thus and so. So when on grounds of systematic e fficacy we
decide to allow a word-'glint,' say, to take a debatable case-full cur­
rency a s general term, the effect is only that the glints, not glinthood or
glintkind, are made to count as obj ects.
Actually, the effect is not even quite that much; for a general term in
good standing can still, like 'unicorn,' be true of nothing. But what typi­
cally happens is the following. Already while we debate whether our sen­
tences may best be so analyzed and extended as to count 'glint' a full­
fledged general term, we have before us certain incompletely analyzed
but useful truths of theory or observation that contain the word; and
then our taking 'glint' as a general term settles the analysis of these sen­
tences in such a way that some of them come to affirm or imply ' ( 3 x ) (x is
a glint ) . '
So if 'round' a n d ' dog' have acquitted themselves t o t h e glory of physi­
cal obj ects, they have done so as general terms true of physical obj ects
and not as singular terms naming attributes or classes. The case for attri­
butes or classes remains open as a separate question, however analo­
gous. The general terms relevant to it are not 'round,' 'dog,' and the like,
but 'trait,' 'species,' and the like; and the relevant singular terms are
not such as 'Sputn i k l' and 'Fido,' but such as 'roundness,' 'caninity,'
'dogkind . '
The offenders w h o have called forth the past few pages a r e those who,
through a confusion that I have j ust now tried to clear up, take it for
granted that everyone in his use of general terms talks directly of attri­
butes (or classe s ) , ipso (acto and willy nilly. The offenders are not those
who make a considered argument for the existence of an attribute or
class for every general term. Such an argument, coming under the head
of what was tolerantly viewed in §48, would be predicated on the sys­
tematic efficacy of admitting abstract general and perhaps abstract sin­
gular terms and using them in such a way as to bring attributes or classes
into the universe of discourse as values, in effect, of the variables of
qua ntification . The merits o f such a course are considered further in
§ § 43 and 5 5 .

like 'roundness' as an insignificant quirk of grammar. Now let me not
seem to be making capital of any pedantic distinction in word forms.
This distinction is only a convenient and dispensable way of marking an
underlying difference that can be uncovered anyway in a distinction of
functions, as lately outlined. But I venture to say that a failure to appre­
ciate the underlying difference correlates nicely with the dismissal of the
verbal distinction.
Along with the offenders last touched on there are others who, like­
wise making light of the distinction between a bstract singular and con­
crete general terms, decide against a bstract obj ects. Apparently these
thinkers have appreciated, for whatever reasons, that concrete general
terms carry no commitment to attributes or classes, and then have con­
cluded the same for the corresponding a bstract singular terms, by dint
of drawing no distinction. This line of thought derives wishful vigor
from a distaste for abstract objects coupled with a taste for their system­
atic e fficacy. The motivation has proved sufficient to induce remarkable
extremes. We find philosophers allowing themselves not only abstract
terms but even pretty unmistakable quantifications over abstract obj ects
( "There are concepts with which . . . ," " . . . some of which propositions
. . . ," " . . . there is something that he doubts or believes " ) , and still
blandly disavowing, within the paragraph, any claim that there are such
o bj ects.'
Pressed, they may explain that a bstract obj ects do not exist the way
physical ones do. The difference is not, they say, j ust a difference in two
sorts of objects, one in space-time and one not, but a difference in two
senses of 'there are'; so that, in the sense in which there are concrete ob­
j ects, there are no abstract ones. But then there remain two difficulties, a
little one and a big one. The little one is that the philosopher who would
repudiate abstract obj ects seems to be left saying that there are such after
all, in the sense of 'there are' appropriate to them. The big one is that the
distinction between there being one sense of 'there are' for concrete ob­
j ects and another for abstract ones, and there being j ust one sense of
'there are' for both, makes no sense. J O

Ontic Decision

Such philosophical double talk, which would repudiate an ontology
while enjoying its benefits, thrives on vagaries of ordinary language . The
trouble is that at best there is no simple correlation between the outward
forms of ordinary affirmations and the existences implied. Thus, granted
that the construction exemplified by 'Agnes has fleas' can very often
be accorded the forthrightly existential sense intended by ' ( 3 x ) ( Fx and
Gx),' there remain abundant cases like 'Tabby eats mice' ( § 2 8 ) and
'Ernest hunts lions' ( § 3 2 ) that cannot. Reflective persons unswayed by
wishful thinking can themselves now and again have cause to wonder
what, if anything, they are talking about.
In our canonical notation of quantification, then, we find the restora­
tion of law and order. Insofar as we adhere to this notation, the obj ects
we are to be understood to admit are precisely the obj ects which we
reckon to the universe of values over which the bound variables of quan­
tification are to be considered to range. Such is simply the intended sense
of the quantifiers ' (x) ' and ' (3xl ' : 'every obj ect x is such that,' 'there is an
obj ect x such that.' The quantifiers are encapsulations of these specially
selected, unequivocally referential idioms of ordinary language. To para­
phrase a sentence into the canonical notation of quantification i�, first
and foremost, to make its ontic content explicit, quantification being a
device for talking in general of obj ects.
The moot or controversial part of the question of the on tic import of a
sentence may of course survive in a new guise, as the question how to
paraphrase the sentence into canonical notation. But the cha nge of guise
conveniently shifts the burden of claims and disavowals. Futile cavil­
ing over ontic implications gives way to an invitation to reformulate
o ne's point in canonical notation. We cannot paraphrase our opponent's
sentences into canonical notation for him and convict him of the con­
sequences, for there is no synonymy; rather we must ask him what ca­
nonical sentences he is prepared to offer, consonantly with his own in­
adequately expressed purposes. If he declines to play this game, the
argument terminates. To decline to explain oneself in terms o f quan­
tification, or in terms of those special idioms of ordinary language by
which quantification is directly explained, is simply to decline to disclose
one's referential intent. We saw in our consideration of radical transla­
tion that an alien language may well fail to share, by any universal stan­
dard, the obj ect-positing pattern of our own; and now our supposititious
opponent is simply standing, however legalistically, on his alien rights.
We remain free as always to project analytical hypotheses ( § § 1 5f. ) and
translate his sentences into canonical notation as seems most reasonable;

The resort to canonical notation as a n aid to clarifying ontie commit­
ments is of l imited polemical power, as j ust now explained. But it does
help us who a re agreeable to the canonical forms to j udge what we care
to consider there to be. We can face the question squarely as a question
what to admit to the universe of values of our variables of quantifica­
tion.
Economy is a consideration, but economy of theory and not j ust of
objects. Also some obj ects may be prefera ble to others in the way sug­
gested for physical obj ects late in § 4 8 : representative sentences in which
they a re treated as objects may be relatively closely associated with sen­
sory stimulation.
We have looked into the benefits of admitting physical obj ects and
classes ( § 4 8 ) , though there will be more to say of classes ( § 5 5 ) . We con­

( § §42f. ) , and the weakness of the case for sense data ( § § 1 , 4 8 ) . At the
extreme, finally, are the sakes and behalves. N o one wants these, but
the form of the argument for their exclusion is instructive. It is that
'sake' and 'behalf' have their uses only in the cl iches 'for the sake of' and
'in behalf of' and their variants: hence these cliche, can be left unan­
alyzed as simple prepositions. ( From the point of view of canonical nota­
tion, prepositions in turn ordinarily get bundled off into relative terms;
d. § 2 2 . )
Units of measure turn o u t somewhat l i k e sakes a n d behalves. 'Mile,'
'minute,' 'degree Fahrenheit,' and the like resemble 'sake' and ' behalf' in
being defectIVe nouns: they are normally used only m a lim ited selection
of the usual term positions. Their defectiveness, though less extreme
than that of 'sake' and ' behalf,' is easily exposed in ab,urd interrogation.
Are miles alike? If so, how can they count as many ? And i f they cannot,
what of the two hundred between Boston and New Yor k ?
Questions a b o u t identity of attributes or of propositions a re in their
turn less a b s urd, on the face of them, than these about identity of miles.
Still the lack of a standard of identity for attributes and propositions can
be viewed similarly, as a case of defectiveness on the part of 'attri bute'
and 'propositi o n . ' Philosophers undertook, however un,uccessfully, to
supply this defect by devising a standard of identity, because they were
persuaded o f the advantages, in systematic utility or whatever, of taking
'attribute' and 'proposition' as full-fledged terms and so admitting attri­
butes and propositions to the universe o f discourse. Thi, line is debat­
able on its specific merits, and we have debated it. The case of 'mile,' 'de­
gree Fahrenheit,' and the like is clearer: no purpm,e is �erved by making
units o f measure accessible to variables of qua ntification. We can ade­
quately accommodate these nouns as parts of relative term� ' length in
miles,' 'temperatu re in degrees Fahrenheit. ' 1 2
Just as the relative term 'author' is true o f this and that man relative to
this and that book, so 'length in miles' i s to be understood a, true of this
and that n umber relative to this and that body or regi o n . Thus instead of
'length of M anhattan = 1 1 miles' we would now say 'length-m-miles
o f Manhattan = 1 1 ' ( form 'P o f b = a') or ' 1 1 I, length-in-miles-of
Manhattan' ( form 'Pab' ) .

push forward to minimum canonical notation by eliminating singular
terms as in Chapter V we would find our quantifiers calling for the num­
ber and the island unmistakably enough:

( 3 x ) ( 3 y ) (x is- I I and y is-Manhattan and x is-length-in­
miles-of y ) .
A n d indeed w e m a y expect numbers t o be very much wanted, n o t only
for this example, as values of our variables; they are nearly as useful as
classes.
In possible concrete obj ects, unactualized possibles, we have another
category of doubtful obj ects whose doubtfulness can be laid to defective
nouns, with as good reason at least as in the case of attributes and prop­
ositions. For here again, and more glaringly than in the case of inten­
sions , there is perplexity over identity; d. § 8 . Even when a position is
specified, as in 'the possible new church on that corner, ' 'the possible ho­
tel on that corner,' the identity of position does not make the possible
obj ects identical. Happily we can cut through all this, sometimes by re­
treating to universals as in § 8 , and more usually by j ust absorbing the
'possible' of 'possible obj ect' appropriately into the context and so not
treating 'possible obj ect' as a term. A sentence about possible churches
can usually be paraphrased satisfactorily enough into a sentence that
treats of churches and is governed, as a whole, by a modal operator of
possibility. One may still ask what kind of modality is wanted, how to
make sense of it, and how to cope with other problems that the modali­
ties of one or another sort have been known to raise; but talk of possible
obj ects would have been no better off with respect to such questions.
The notion of possible obj ects has been encouraged by two philosoph­
ical quandaries. One of them is raised by the verbs 'hunting,' 'wanting, '
and the like, which cannot in general be looked upon as relating the
agent to actual obj ects ( d. § § 2 8 , 3 2 ) . Possible lions, possible unicorns,
possi ble sloops suggest themselves as surrogate obj ects for such activ­
ities. But these matters can be handled more illuminatingly by para­
phrase, as seen, into the idioms of propositional attitude. One is left with
the problems of propositional attitude, but those, unlike the vagaries of
unactualized possibles, are with us anyway.
The other quandary is raised by terms in want of obj ects: what are we
talking about when we say there are no unicorns, or that there is no such
thing as Pegasus ? Partly this quandary comes of being carried away by
the object-directed pattern of our thinking-if not to the extreme talked

Ontic Decision
of in § 49, at least to the point of trying to see every sentence as " about"
certain obj ects. Actually 'unicorn' and 'Pegasus' can be perfectly good
terms, well understood in that their contexts arc well enough linked to
sensory stimulation or to intervening theory, without there being uni­
corns or Pegasus. Mainly it is on singular terms like 'Pegasus' that the
quandary has centered rather than general ones like 'unicorn'; for it is
there that under ordinary usage the truth-value gaps set in ( § 3 7 ) , in a
philosophically uncomfortable way. However, the canonical expedient
of reparsing singular terms regularizes these matters and so ends, one
may hope, any temptation to venture out on the morass of unactualized
possi bles. ' 1
The notions of possihle obj ect and proposition are two that were en­
couraged by philosophical quandaries. A third is that of fact. The word
'fact' is commonplace enough, hut where the philosophical motivation
enters is in choosing to admit facts as obj ects rather than fob the word
off with the lower-grade sort of treatment accorded 'sake' and 'mile . '
Part o f what encouraged admission of propositions w a s a wish for
eternal truth-value vehicles independent of particular languages ( % 4 0 ) .
Part of what cncourages admission of facts is perhaps a wish t o defer
the question what makes a sentence or proposition true: those are true
that state facts. Another force that has encouraged both acceptances is,
again, the tendency to be carried away by obj ect-directed thinking: a ten­
dency, in this case, to liken sentences to names and then posit obj ects for
them to name. It is perhaps where this force is the dominant one that we
encounter readiness, as we occasionally do, to identify facts with propo­
sitions (viz., with some or all of the true ones ) .
A n additional connotation that often invests the word ' fact,' both in
philosophy and in lay usage, is that of unvarnished obj ectivitv plus a cer­
tain accessibil ity to observation. In philosophical usage this connotation
is sometimes adopted and widened in such wise that facts come to be
posited corresponding to all the " synthetic " truths and withheld only
from the " analytic" ones. So here that same analytic-synthetic dichot­
omy intrudes which we have found so dubious ( § 1 4 ) ; and it intrudes in a
most implausibly absolute guise, independent apparently of all choice of
language. The disarmingly commonplace ring of the word 'fact' comes
even to lend the dichotomy a spurious air of intelligibility: the analytic
sentences (or propositions) are the true ones that lack factual content.
There i s a tendency-not among those who take facts as proposi13. See Bertrand Ru"ell, " O n Dcnotll1g," Mmd 14 ( 1 90 5 ) ,

tions-to think of facts as concrete. This is fostered by the commonplace
ring of the word and the hint of bruteness, and is of a piece, for that mat­
ter, with the basic conception that it is facts that make sentences true. Yet
what can they be, and be concrete ? The sentences 'Fifth Avenue is six
miles long' and 'Fifth Avenue is a hundred feet wide,' if we suppose them
true, presumably state different facts; yet the only concrete or at any rate
physical object involved is Fifth Avenue. I resolved ( § 4 8 ) not to cavil
over 'concrete,' but I suspect that the sense of 'concrete' in which facts
are concrete is not one that need endear them to us.
Facts, moreover, are in the same difficulty over a standard of identity
as propositions were seen to be. And surely they cannot be seriously sup­
posed to help us explain truth. Our two sentences last quoted are true
because of Fifth Avenue, because it is a hundred feet wide and six miles
long, because it was planned and made that way, and because of the
way we use our words; only indirection results from positing facts, in
the image of sentences, as intermediaries. Probably no such temptation
would arise if the word were not already there performing an overlap­
ping though unphilosophical function for ordinary discourse.
In ordinary usage 'fact' often occurs where we could without loss say
'true sentence' or (if it is our way) 'true proposition.' But its main utility
seems to be rather as a reinforcement of the flimsy 'that' of propositional
abstraction ( § 34 ) . It is wanted there merely because of the idiomatic un­
naturalness, in many substantival positions, of a pure 'that' -clause. (Yet
it is limited in this syntactical service to 'that' -clauses that are taken to be
true; for 'fact' persists in imputing truth . ) It has a further use sti l l in a b­
breviated cross-reference: we often manage to avoid repeating a long
previous affirmation by saying 'that fact. ' Now so far as these uses go
there is no call to posit facts, certainly not over and above propositions,
nor any difficulty in absorbing or paraphrasing away the word. Nor
have the peculiarly philosophical appeals to fact impressed us.

O u r talk of external things, o u r very notion of things, i s j ust a concep­
tual apparatus that helps us to foresee and control the triggering of our
sensory receptors in the light of previous triggering of our sensory recep­
tors. The triggering, first and last, is all we have to go on.
In saying this I too am talking of external things, namely, people and
their nerve endings. Thus what I a m saying applies in particular to what
I am saying, and is not meant as skeptical. There is nothing we can be
more confident of than external things-some of them, anyway-other
people, sticks, stones. But there remains the fact-a fact of science it­
self-that science is a conceptual bridge of our own making, linking sen­
sory stimulation to sensory stimulation; there is no extrasensory percep­
tion.
I should like now to consider how this bridging operation works.
What docs it mean to assume external objects ? And what about obj ects
of a n a bstract sort, such as numbers ? How do obj ects of both sorts help
us in developing systematic connections between our sensory stimula­
tions ?
The assuming of obj ects is a mental act, and mental acts are notori­
ously difficult to pin down-this one more than most. Little can be done
in the way of tracking thought processes except when we can put words
to them. For something objective that we can get our teeth into we must
go after the words. Words accompany thought for the most part anyway,
and it is only as thoughts are expressed in words that we can specify
them.
I f we turn our attention to the words, then what had been a question
of assuming obj ects becomes a question of verbal rclerel1ce to objects. To
ask what the assumil1K of an obj ect consists in is to ask what relerril1K to
the obj ect consists in.
229

230

QUINTESSENCE

We refer by using words, and these we learn through more or less de­
viclUs association with stimulations of our sensory receptors. The associ­
ation is direct in cases where the word is learned by ostension. It is thus
that the child learns to volunteer the word 'milk,' or to assent if the word
is queried, in the conspicuous presence of milk; also to volunteer the
word so as to induce the presence of milk.
The mechanism in such a case is relatively clear and simple, as psycho­
logical mechanisms go. It is the conditioning of a response. To call it ob­
j ective reference, however, is premature. Learning the expression 'milk'
in this way, by direct association with appropriate stimulations, is the
same in principle as learning the sentence 'It's windy' or 'It's cold' or 'It's
raining' by direct association with appropriate stimulations. It is we in
our adult ontological sophistication that recognize the word 'milk' as re­
ferring to an obj ect, a substance, while we are less ready to s ingle out an
o bj ect of reference for 'It's windy' or 'It's cold' or 'It's raining.' This is the
contrast that we need eventually to analyze if we are to achieve a satis­
factory analysis of what to count as obj ective reference; and it is not a
contrast that obtrudes in the primitive phase of learning hy ostension.
The word 'milk,' when uttered in recognition or when queried and as­
sented to, is best regarded at first as a sentence on a par with 'It's windy,'
'It's cold,' and the rest; it is as if to say 'It's milk.' It is a one-word sen­
tence. All of these examples are occasioll sentences, true on some occa­
sions of utterance and false on others. We are conditioned to assent to
them under appropriate stimulation. There is no call to read into them,
as yet, any reference to objects.
The view of sentences as primary in semantics, and of names or other
words as dependent on sentences for their meaning, is a fruitful idea
that began perhaps with Jeremy Bentham's theory of fictions.] What
Bentham observed was that you have explained any term quite ade­
quately if you have shown how all contexts in which you propose to use
it can be paraphrased into antecedently intelligible language. When this
is recognized, the philosophical analysis of concepts or explication of
terms comes into its own. Sentences come to be seen as the primary re­
pository of meaning, and words are seen as imhihing their meaning
through their use in sentences.
Recognition of sentences as primary has not only expedited philo­
sophical analysis; it has also given us a better picture of how language is
1. See Essay 7 below I Chapter 1 8] .

Thi ngs and TheIr Place tn Theories

actually learned. First we learn short sentences, next we get a line on var­
ious words through their usc in those sentences, and then on that basis
we manage to grasp longer sentences in which those same words recur.
Accordingly the development leading frolll sensory stimulation to objec­
tive reference is to be seen as beginn ing with the flat conditioning of sim­
ple occasion sentences to stimulatory events, and advancing through
stages more forthrightly identifiable with objective reference. We have
still to consider what the distinguishing traits of these further stages
might be.
As long as the word 'milk' can be accounted for simply as an occasion
sentence on a par with ' It's raining,' surely nothing is added by saying
that it is a name of something. Nothing really is said. Similarly for
'sugar; 'water, ' 'wood . ' Similarly even for 'Fido' and 'Mama . ' We would
be idly declaring there to be designata of the words, counterparts, shad­
ows, one apiece: danglers, serving only as honorary designata of expres­
sions whose use as occasion sentences would continue as before.
The outlook changes when individuative words emerge: words l ike
'chair' and 'dog.' These differ from the previous examples in the com­
plexity o f what has to be mastered in learning them. By way of mastery
of any of those previous words, all that was called for was the ability to
pass a true-false test regarding points or neighborhoods taken ooe at a
time. It is merely a question, in the case of Fido or milk, of what visible
points are on Fido or on milk and what ones are not. To master 'dog' or
'chair,' on the other hand, it is not enough to he able to j udge of each vis­
ible point whether it is on a dog or chair; we have also to learn where
one dog or chair leaves off and an other sets in.
I n the case of such words, individuative ones, the idea of obj ective ref­
erence seems less trivial and more substantial. The word 'dog' is taken to
denote each of many things, each dog, and the word 'chair, ' each chair. It
is no longer an idle one-to-one duplication, a mirroring of each word in
an object dreamed up for that exclusive purpose. The chairs and dogs
are indefinite in number and individually, fo r the most part, nameless.
The 'Fido'-Fido principle, as Ryle called it, has been transcended.
However, this contrast between the individuatives and the previous
words does not become detecta ble until a further device has become
available: predication. The contrast emerges only when we arc in a posi­
tion to compare the predication 'Fido is a dog' with the predication
'Milk is whIte . ' Milk's being white comes down to the simple fact that
whenever you point at milk you point at white. Fido's being a dog does

23 1

232

QUINTESSENCE

not come down to the simple fact that whenever you point at Fido you
point at a dog: it involves that and more. For whenever you point at
Fido's head you point at a dog, and yet Fido's head does not qualify as
a dog.
It is in this rather suhtle way that predication creates a difference be­
tween individuative terms and others. Prior to predication, such words
as 'dog' and 'chair' differ in no pertinent way from 'milk' and 'Fido';
they are simple occasion sentences that herald, indifferently, the presence
of milk, Fido, dog, chair.
Thus reference may be felt to have emerged when we take to predicat­
ing individuative terms, as in 'Fido is a dog.' 'Dog' then comes to qualify
as a general term denoting each dog, and thereupon, thanks again to the
predication 'Fido is a dog,' the word 'Fido' comes at last to qualify as a
singular term naming one dog. In view then of the analogy of 'Milk is
white' to 'Fido is a dog,' it becomes natural to view the word 'milk' like­
wise as a singular term naming something, this time not a body but a
substance.
In Word and Object and The Roots of Reference I have speculated on
how we learn individuative terms, predication, and various further es­
sentials of our language. r will not go further into that, but will merely
remind you of what some of these further essentials are. Along with sin­
gular predication, as in 'Milk is white' and 'Fido is a dog,' we want plu­
ral predication: 'Dogs are animals. ' Along with monadic general terms,
moreover, such as 'dog' and 'animal,' we want dyadic ones, such as 'part
of,' 'darker than,' 'bigger than,' and ' beside'; also perhaps triadic and
higher. Also we want predication of these polyadic terms, at least in the
singular: thus 'Mama is bigger than Fido,' 'Fido is darker than milk."
Also we want the truth functions-'not,' 'and,' 'or'-by means of which
to build compound sentences.
Now a further leap forward, as momentous as predication, is the rela­
tive clause. It is a way of segregating what a sentence says about an oh­
j ect, and packaging it as a complex general term. What the sentence
Mont Blanc is higher than the Matterhorn hut the Matterhorn
is steeper
says about the Matterhorn is packaged in the relative clause:
ohject that is not as high as Mont Blanc hut is steeper.

Things and Their Place in Theories

Predicating this of the Matterhorn carries us hack in effect to thc original
sentence .
The grammar of relative clauses can he simplified by rewriting them i n
t h e 'such that' idiom:
o bject x such that -'iont Blanc is higher than x but x is stceper.
This keeps the word order of the original sentence. The 'x' is j ust a rela­
tive pronoun written in mathematical style. We can change the letter to
avoid amhiguity in case onc relative clause is embedded in another.
The relative clause serves no purpose in singular predication, since
such predication j ust carries us hack to a sentcnce of the original form.
Where it pays off is in plural predication. Without relative clauses, the
use of plural predication is cramped by shortage of general terms. We
could still say 'Dogs are animals' and perhaps 'Small dogs are amusing
animals, ' but it is only with the advent of relative clauses that we can as­
pire to such heights as 'Whatever is salvagcd from the wreck belongs to
the state . ' It becomes:
O hjects x such that x is salvaged from the wreck are objects x
such that x belongs to the state.
In general, where ' Fx' and ' Gx' stand for any sentenccs that we are in a
position to formulate about x, relative clauses open the way to the plural
predication:

said that reference may be felt to emcrge with the predicating of
i ndividuatives. However, it is hettcr seen as emcrging by degrees. Al­
ready at the start the sentences 'Fido' and 'Milk,' unlikc 'It's raining,' are
learned hy association with distinctively salient portions of the scene.
Typically the salience is induced hy pointing. Here already, in the selec­
tivity of salience, is perhaps a first step toward the eventual namehood of
'Fido' and '-'iil k . ' Predications such as 'Milk is white' further cnhancc
this air of obj ective reference, hinging as they do on a coinciding of
saliences. Thus contrast the predication 'Milk is white' with 'When night

falls the lamps are lit.' 'When' here is a connective comparahle to the
truth functions; it j ust happens to deliver standing sentences rather than
occasion sentences when applied to occasion sentences . 'Milk is white'
likewise can be viewed as a standing sentence compounded of the occa­
sion sentences 'Milk' and 'White; but it says more than 'When there is
milk there is white' ; it s a y s ' Where there is m i l k there is white . ' T h e con­
centration on a special part of the scene is thus doubly emphasized, and
in this I sense further rumblings of objective reference.
Predications such as 'Milk is wh ite' still afford, even so, little reason
for imputing obj ective reference. As already remarked, we might as well
continue to usc the purported names as occasion sentences and let the
obj ects go. A finite and listed ontology is no ontology.
Predication of individuatives, next, as in 'Fido is a dog,' heightens ref­
erence in two ways. The concentration on a special part of the scene is
emphasized here more strongly still than in ''\1ilk is white,' since Fido is
required not merely to be contained in the scattered part of the world
that is made up of dog; he is required to fill one of its discrete blobs. And
the more telling point, already noted, is that 'dog' transcends the 'Fido'­
Fido principle; dogs arc largely nameless.
Even at this stage, however, the referential apparatus and its ontology
are vague. Individuation goes dim over any appreciable time interval.
Thus consider the term 'dog.' We would recognize any particular dog in
his recurrences if we noticed some distinctive trait in him; a dumb ani­
mal would do the same. We recognize Fido in his recurrences in learning
the occasion sentence 'Fido; j ust as we recognize further milk and sugar
in learning 'Milk' and 'Sugar. ' Even in the a bsence of distinctive traits we
will correctly concatenate momentary canine manifestations as stages of
the same dog as long as we keep watching. After any considerable lapse
of observation, however, the question of identity of unspecified dogs
simply does not arise-not at the rudimentary stage of language learn­
ing. It scarcely makes sense until we are in a position to say such things
as that in general if any dog undergoes such and such then in due course
that same dog will behave thus and so. This sort of general talk about
long-term causation becomes possible only with the advent of quanti­
fication or its equivalent, the relative clause in plural predication. Such is
the dependence of individuation, in the time dimension, upon relative
clauses; and it is only with full individuation that reference comes fully
into its own.
With the relative clause at hand, obj ective reference is indeed full

Things and Their Place in Theories

blown. In the relative clause the channel of reference is the relative pro­
noun 'that' or 'which; together with its recurrences in the guise of 'it,'
'he,' 'her,' and so on. Regimented in symbolic logic, these pronouns give
way to bound variables of quantification. The variables range, as we say,
over all obj ects; they admit all obj ects as values. To assume obj ects of
some sort is to reckon objects of that sort among the values of our vari­
ables.
II

What objects, then, do we find ourselves assuming? Certainly bodies.
The emergence of reference endowed the occasion sentences 'Dog' and
'Animal' with the status of general terms denoting bodies, and the occa­
sion sentences 'Fido' and 'Mama' with the status of singular terms desig­
nating bodies.
We can see how natural it is that some of the occasion sentences osten­
sivcly learned should have been such as to foreshadow bodies, if we re­
flect on the social character of ostension. The child learns the occasion
sentence from the mother while they view the scene from their respective
vantage points, receiving somewhat unlike presentations. The mother in
her childhood learned the sentence in similarly divergent circumstances.
'rhe sentence is thus hound to be versatile, applying regardless of angle.
Thus it is that the aspects of a body in all their visual diversity are natu­
rally gathered under a single occasion sentence, ultimately a single desig­
nation.
We saw how the reification of milk, wood, and other substances
would follow naturally and closely o n that of bodies. Bodies are our
paradigmatic obj ects, but analogy proceeds apace; nor docs it stop with
substances. Grammatical analogy between general terms and singular
terms encourages us to treat a general term as if it designated a single ob­
j ect, and thus we are apt to posit a realm of obj ects for the general terms
to designate: a realm of properties, or sets. What with the nominalizing
also of verbs and clauses, a vaguely varied and very untidy ontology
grows up.
The common man's ontology is vague and untidy in two ways. It takes
in many purported obj ects that are vaguely or inadequately defined. But
also, what is more significant, it is vague in its scope; we cannot even tell
in general which of these vague things to ascrihe to a man's ontology at
all, which things to count him as assuming. Should we regard grammar

235

236

QUINTESSENCE

as decisive ? Does every noun demand some array of denotata ? Surely
not; the nominalizing of verbs is often a mere stylistic variation. But
where can we draw the line?
It is a wrong question; there is no line to draw. Bodies are assumed,
yes; they are the things, first and foremost. Beyond them there is a suc­
cession of dwindling analogies. Various expressions come to be used in
ways more or less parallel to the use of the terms for bodies, and it is felt
that corresponding obj ects are more or less posited, tJari tJassu; but there
is no purpose in trying to mark an ontological limit to the dwindling par­
allelism.
My point is not that ordinary language is slipshod, slipshod though it
be. We must recognize this grading off for what it is, and recognize that a
fenced ontology is j ust not implicit in ordinary language. The idea of a
boundary between being and non being is a philosophical idea, an idea of
technical science in a broad sense. Scientists and philosophers seck a
comprehensive system of the world, and one that is oriented to reference
even more squarely and utterly than ordinary language . Ontological
concern is not a correction of a lay thought and practice; it is foreign to
the lay culture, though an outgrowth of it.
We can draw explicit ontological lines when desired. We can regiment
our notation, admitting only general and singular terms, singular and
plural predication, truth functions, and the machinery of relative
clauses; or, equivalently and more artificially, instead of plural predica­
tion and relative clauses we can admit quantification. Then it is that we
can say that the obj ects assumed arc the values of the variables, or of the
pronouns. Various rurns of phrase in ordinary language that seemed to
invoke novel sorts of obj ects may disappear under such regimentation.
At other points new ontic commitments may emerge. There is room for
choice, and one chooses with a view to simplicity in one's overall system
of the world.
More obj ects are wanted, certainly, than just bodies and substances.
We need all sorts of parts or portions of substances. For lack of a defin­
able stopping place, the natural course at this point is to admit as an ob­
j ect the material content of any portion of space-time, however irregu­
lar and discontinuous and heterogeneous. This is the generalization of
the primitive and ill-defined category o f bodies to what I call physical
obj ects.
Substances themselves fall into place now as physical objects. Milk, or
wood, or sugar, is the discontinuous four-dimensional physical object
comprising all the world's milk, or wood, or sugar, ever.

Things and Their Place ill Theones

The reasons for taking the physical objects thus spatiotemporally, and
treating time on a par with space, are overwhelming and have been ade­
quately noted in various places.' Let us pass over them and ponder
rather the opposition to the four-dimensional view; for it is a curiosity
worth looking into. Part of the opposition is obvious misinterpretation:
the notion that time is stopped, change is denied, and all is frozen eter­
nally in a fourth dimension. These are the misgivings of unduly nervous
folk who overestimate the power of words. Time as a fourth dimension
is still time, and differences along the fourth dimension are still changes;
they are merely treated more simply and efficiently than they otherwise
might be.
Opposition has proceeded also from the venerable doctrine that not
all the statements about the future have truth values now, because some
of them remain, as of now, causally undetermined. Properly viewed,
however, determinism is beside the point. The question of future truths is
a matter of verbal convenience and is as innocuous as Doris Day's tauto­
logical fatalism " Che Sara Sara . "
Another question that has been similarly linked t o determinism,
wrongly and notoriously, is that of freedom of the will. Like Spinoza,
Hume, and so many others, r count an act as free insofar as the agent's
motives or drives are a link in its causal chain. Those motives or drives
may themselves be as rigidly determined as you please.
It is for me an ideal of pure reason to subscribe to determinislll as fully
as the quantum physicists will let me. But there are well-known dif­
ficulties in the way of rigorously formulating it. When we say of some
event that it is determined by present ones, shall we mean that there is a
general conditional, true but perhaps unknown to li S , whose antecedent
is instantiated by present events and whose consequent is instantiated by
the future event in question ? Without some drastic limitations on COIll ­
plexity and vocabulary, determinism so defined is pretty s ure to boil
down to " Che sara sara " and to afford at best a great idea for a song. Yet
the idea in all its vagueness retains validity as an ideal of reason. It is
valid as a general inj unction: look for mechanisms.
This has been quite a spray, or spree, of philosophical miscellany. Let
us now return to our cabbages, which is to say, our newly generalized
physical o bj ects. One of the benefits that the generalization confers is the
accommodation of events as objects. An action or transaction can he
identified with the physical obj ects consisting of the temporal segment or
2 . For example. in my Word and Oblect. pp. 1 70ff.

237

QUINTESSENCE

segments of the agent or agents for the duration. Misgivings about this
approach to events have been expressed, on the grounds that it does not
distinguish two acts that are performed simultaneously, such as walking
and chewing gum. But [ think that all the distinctions that need to be
drawn can be drawn, still, at the level of general terms. Not all walks are
gum chewings, nor vice versa, even though an occasional one may be.
Some things may be said of an act o n the score of its being a walk, and
distinctive things may be said of it on the score of its being a chcwing of
gum, even though it be accounted one and the same event. There are its
crural features on the one hand and its maxillary features o n the other.
A reason for being particularly glad to have accommodated events is
Davidson's logic of adverbs, 1 for Davidson has shown to my satisfaction
that quantification ovcr events is far and away the hest way of constru­
ing adverbial constructions.
Our liberal notion of physical obj ects brings out an important point
about identity. Some philosophers propound puzzles as to what to say
about personal identity in cases of split personality or in fantasies about
metempsychosis or brain transplants. These are not questions about the
nature of identity. They arc questions about how we might best con­
strue the term 'person . ' Again there is the stock example of the sbip o f
Theseus, rebuilt b i t b y b i t until no original b i t remained. Whether we
choose to reckon it still as the same ship is a question not of 'same' but of
'ship'; a question of how we choose to individuate that term over time.
Any coherent general term has its own principle of individuation,
its own criterion of identity among its denotata . Often the principle is
vague, as the principle of individuation of persons is shown to be by the
science-fiction examples; and a term is as vague as its principle of indi­
viduation.
Most of our general terms individuate by continuity considerations,
because continuity favors causal connections. But even useful terms,
grounded in continuity, often diverge in their individuation, as witness
the evolving ship of Theseus, on the one hand, and its original substance,
gradually dispersed, on the other. Continuity follows both branches.
All this should have been clear without help of our liberal notion of
physical object, but this notion drives the point home. It shows how
empty it would be to ask, out of context, whether a certain glimpse yes3. Donald DaVidson, "The Logical Form o f Acnon Sl'ntencc�, " In NiCholas

terday and a certain glimpse today were glimpses of the same thing.
Th ey may or may not have been glimpses of the same bodv, hut thev cer�
tainly were glimpses of a same thing, a same physical o bject; for the con�
tent of any portion of space�time, however miscellaneo usly scattered i n
space and t i m e t h a t portion b e , counts as a physical object.
The president or presidency of the United States IS one such physIcal
o bj ect, though not a body. It is a spatially discontinu o u s object made up
of temporal segments, each of which is a temporal stage also o f a body, a
human one. The whole thing has its temporal beginning in 1 78 9 , when
George Washington took office, and its end only at the final takeover,
quite possibly more than two centuries later. Another somewhat similar
physical object is the Dalai Lama, an example that has been invigorated
by a myth of successive reincarnation. But the myth is unnece'5an·.
A body is a special kind of physical object, one that is roughly contin�
uuus spatially and rather chunky and that contrasts abruptlv with most
of its surroundings and is individuated over time by cont i n u i ty of dis�
placement, distortion, and discoloration. Tbese arc vague criteria, espe�
cially so in view of molecular theory, which teaches that the boundarv of
a solid is ill defined and that the continuity of a solid " on Iv apparent
and properlv a matter of degree.
The step of generalization from body to physical object follows natu�
rally, we saw, on the reification of portions of stuff. It fol l ows equallv
naturally on molecular theory: if even a solid is diffuse, why stop there ?
We can be happy not to have to rest existence itself on the vague no�
tions of body and substance, as we would have to do i f bodies and sub�
stances were o ur whole ontology. Specific individuatives such as 'dog' or
'desk' continue, like ' body,' to suffer from vagueness on the score of the
microphysical boundaries of their denotata, as well as vagueness on the
score of marginal denotata themselves, such as makeshift desks and re�
mote ancestors of dogs; but all this is vagueness only of classificatIon and
not of existence. All the variants qualify as physica l objects.
Physical objects in this genero lls sense constitute a fairly Llv"h uni�

tals. Nor can we rest with constants; we m ust quantify over numbers.
Admitting numbe" .IS values of variables means rtifying them and rec­
ognizing numerals as names of them; and this is required for the sake of
generality In our quantItative laws.
Measures have sometimes been viewed as impure numbers: nine miles,
nine gallofl'>. We do better to follow Carnap' in construing each scale of
measurement ." a polyadic general term rebting physical obj ects to pure
numbers. Thus 'gallon xy ' means that the presu mably fluid and perhaps
scattered physic,, 1 object x amounts to y gallons, and 'mile xyz' means
that the physical objects x and y are Z miles apart. Pure numbers, then,
apparently belong in our ontology.
Classes do too, for whenever we count things we measure a class. If a
statistical generalitv about populations quantifies over numbers of peo­
ple, it h"s to quantify also over the classes whose numbers those are.
Quantification over classes figures also in other equally inconspicuous
wavs, as witness Frege's f,lmiliar definition of ancestor in terms of par­
ent: one's ancestors , ue tbe members shared hy every class that contains
onese l f and the parents of its memhers.
Sometimes in natural science we are concerned explicitly with classes,
or seem to he�notahly In taxonomy. We read tbat there are over a quar­
ter-million s pecies of beetles. Here evidently we are concerned with a
qua rter-mil l i on classes and, over and a bove these, a class of all these
classes. However, we celn economize here. Instead of talking of species in
this context, we can make do with a dvadic general term applicable to
beetles: 'conspccific . ' TCl s a y that there a r e over a quarter-million species
is equivalent to saying that there is a class of over a quarter-million bee­
tles none of whIch are conspecihc. This sti l l conveys impressive informa­
tion, and it still req ll ires reification of a big class, but a class only of bee­
tles and not of classes.
Th IS wav of dodglflg a class of cl asses is not always available. It
worked here because species arc m utually excl usive.
Note the purely auxiliarv role of classes in a ll three examples. I n
countIng thI ngs w e are more interested in t h e things counted t h a n in
their cia". In the genealogical example the concern is with people, their
pa rentage ,lI1d ancestry; classes entered only in deriving the one from
the other. In the example of the beetles, classes were indeed out in the
open--even Iflordillatelv so, I argued. But even so, it is because of an in­
terest still strictly in beetles, not classes, that one says there are so many

species. The ,tatement tells m that beetles are highly discriminate in their
mating. It conveys this sort of information, but more precisely, and it
makes a u xiliary reference to classes as a means of doing so. Limited to
physical obj ects though our interests be, an appeal to classes can thus be
instrumental in pursuing those interests . I look upon mathematics in
general in the same way, in its relation to natural science. But to view
classes, numbers, and the rest in this instrumental way is not to deny
having reified them; it is only to explain why.
1Il

So we assume abstract objects over and above the physical o bj ects. For a
better grasp of what this means, let us consider a si mple case: the natural
numbers. Tbe conditions we need to impose on them are simple and few :
w e n e e d to assume an obj ect as fi r s t number and an operator t h a t vields
a unique new number whenever applied to a number. In short, we need a
progression. Any progression will do, for the following reasons. The
fundamental use of natural numbers is in measuring classes: in saying
that a class has n members. Other serious uses prove to be reducible to
this use. But any progression will serve thIS purpose; for we can say that
a class has n members by saying that its members arc in correlation with
the members 01 the progression up to l1-not caring which progression it
may be.
There are ways of defining specific progressions of classes, no end of
ways. When we feel the need of natural numbers we can simply reach for
members of one of these progressions instead-whichever one comes
handy. On the basis of natural numbers, in turn, It is possible with the
help of classes to define the ratios and the irrational numbers in well­
known ways. On one such construction they turn out to be simply cer­
tain classes o f natural numbers. So, when we feel the need of ratIos and
irrationals, we can simply reach for appropriate subcLtsses of onE of the
progressiom of classes. We need never talk of numbers, though in prac­
tice it is convenient to carry over the numerical j argon.
Numbers, then, except as a manner of speaking, are by the board . We
have physical objects and we have classes. Not j u st classes of physical
obj ects, but classes of classes and so on up. Some of these h igher levels
are needed to do the work of numbers and other gear of a pplied mathe­
matics, and one then assumes the whole hierarchy if o n l v for w a n t of a
natural stopping place.
But now wbat are classe s ? Consider the bottom laVEr, the classes of

241

physical objects. Every relative clause or other general term determines a
class, the class of those physical ohj ects of which the term can be truly
predicated. Two terms determioe the same class of physical obj ects j ust
in case the terms are true of j ust the saille physical objects . Still, compati­
blv with all this we could reconstrue every class systematicallv as its
complement and then compensate for the switch bv rein terpreting the
dyadic general term 'member of' to mean what had been meant by 'not a
member of. ' The effects would cancel and one would never know.
We thus seem to see a profound difference between abstract obj ects
and concrete ones. A physical object, one feels, can be pinned down by
pointing-in many cases, anyway, and to a fair degree. But I am per­
suaded that this contrast is illusory.
By way of example, consider again my liberalized notion of a physical
object as the material content of any place-time, any portion of space­
time. This was an in tuitive explanatio n , intending no reification of
space-time itself. But we could just as well reify those portions of space­
time and treat of them instead of the physical objects. O r, indeed, call
them physical objects. Whatever can be said from the old point of view
can be paraphrased to suit the new point of view, with no effect on the
structure of scientific theory or on its links with o bservational evidence.
Wherever we had a predication 'x is a P, ' said of a physical obj ect x, we
would in effect read 'x is the place-time of a P'; actually we would j ust
reinterpret the old 'P' as 'pl ace-time of a P, ' and rewrite nothing,
Space separate l y, or place anyway, is an untenable notion, I f there
were rea lly places, there would be absol ute rest and absolute motion; for
change of place would be absolute motion. However, there i s no such
obj ection to place-times or space-time.
I f we accept a redundant ontology containing both physical obj ects
and place-times, then we can indeed declare them distinct; but even then,
if we switch the physical obj ects with their place-times and then compen­
sate by reinterpreting the dyadic general term 'is the material content
of' to mean 'is the place-time of' and vice versa, no one can tell the dif­
ference. We could choose either interpretation indifferently if we were
translating from an unrelated language.
These last examples are unnatural, for they work only if the empty
place-times arc repudiated and j ust the full ones arc admitted as values
of the variables. I f we were seriously to reconstrue physical obj ects as
place-times, we wou ld surely enlarge our u niverse to include the empty
ones and thus gain the simpl icity of a continuous system o f coordinates.

This change in ontology, the abandonment o f physical objects in favor
of pure space-time, proves to be more than a contrived example. The ele­
mentary particles have been wavering alarmingly as physics p rogresses.
Situations arise that curiously challenge the individuality of a particle,
not only over time, but even at a single time. A field theory i n which
states arc ascribed directly to place-times may well present a better pic­
ture, and some physicists think it docs.
At this point a further transfer o f ontology s uggests itself: we can drop
the space-time regions in favor of the corresponding classes o f quadru­
ples of numbers according to an arbitrarily adopted sYstem of coordi­
nates. We arc left with j ust the ontology of pure set theory, since the
numbers and their qu adruples can be modeled witbin it. There arc no
longer any p hysical o bj ects to serve as individuals at the base of the hier­
archy of classes, but there is no harm in that. It i s common practice 1 11 set
theory nowadays to start merely with the null class, form its unit class,
and so on, thus generating an infinite lot o f c i a sses, from which all the
llsual luxuriance of further infinites can be generated.
One may obj ect to thus identifying the world with the o utput of so ar­
hitrarily chosen a system of coordinates. On the other hand, one may
condone this on the ground that no numerically specific coordinates will
appear in the laws o f truly theoretical physics, thanks to the very arbi­
trariness of the coordinates. The specificity of the coordinates would
make itself known only when one descends to coarser matters of astron­
omy, geographv, geology, and history, and here it is perhaps appropriate.
We have now looked at three cases I II which we interpret o r rei nter­
pret one domain of objects by identifying it with part of another domain.
Tn the first example, numbers were identified with some of the cia"es in
one way or another. In the second example, physica l obj ects were identi­
fied with some of the place-times, namely, the full ones. In the third
example, place-times were identified with some of the classes, ndmely,
classes of quadruples of numbers. In each such case simplicity is gained,
if to begin with we had been saddled with the two doma in s .
There is a fourth example of the same thing t h a t is worth noting, fo r it
concerns the long-debated dualism of mind and body. I hardly need say
that the dualism is unattractive. If mind and body are to interact, we are
at a loss for a plausible mech anism to the pllrpose. Also we are faced
with the melancholy office of talking physicists ollr of their chenshed
conservation laws. On the other hand, an aseptic dualistic paralleltsm I S

that William of Ockham so rightly deplored. But now it is easily seen
that dual ism with o r without interaction is reduci ble to physical mo­
nism, un less disembodied spirits are assumed. For the dualist who rejects
disembodied spirits is bound to agree that for every state of mind there is
an exactly concurrent and readily specifiable state of the accompanying
body. Readily specifiable certainly; the bodily state is specifiable simply
as the state of accompanying a mind that is in that mental state. But then
we can settle for the bodily states outright, bypassing the mental states in
terms of which I specified them. We can j ust reinterpret the mentalistic
terms as denoting these correlated bodily states, and who is to know the
difference ?
This reinterpretation of mentalistic terms is reminiscent of the treat­
ment of events that I suggested earlier, and it raises the same question of
discrimination of concurrent events. Bur I would j ust propose again the
answer that I gave then.
I take it as evident that there is no inverse option here, no hope of sus­
taining mental monism hy assigning mental states to all states of physical
obj ects.
These four cases of reductive reinterpretation are gratifying, enabling
us as they do to dispense with one of two domains and make do with
the other alone. But I find the other sort o f reinterpretation equally in­
structive, the sort where we save nothing but merely change or seem to
change our obj ects without disturbing either the structure or the empiri­
cal support of a scien tific theory in the slightest. All that is needed in ei­
ther case, clearly, is a rule whereby a unique obj ect of the supposedly
new sort is assigned to each of the old objects. I call such a rule a proxy
function. Then, instead of predicating a general term ' P' of an old obj ect
x , saying that x is a P, we reinterpret x as a new obj ect and say that it is
the f of a P, where 'f expresses the proxy function. Instead of saying that
x is a dog, we say that x is the lifelong filament of space-time taken up by
a dog. Or, really, we just adhere to the old term ' P,' 'dog,' and reinterpret
it as 'f of a P,' 'place-time of a dog.' This is the strategy that we have seen
in various example s .
T h e apparent change is twofold and sweeping. The original objects
have been supplanted and the genera l terms reinterpreted. There has
been a revision o f ontology on the one hand and of ideology, so to say,
on the other; they go together. Yet verbal behavior proceeds undis­
turbed, warranted by the same observations as before and elicited by the
same observations. Nothing really has changed .

The conclusion I draw is the inscruta hility of reference. To say what
ohjects someone is talking about is to say no more than how we propose
to translate his terms into ours; we are free to vary the decision with a
proxy fu nction. The translation adopted arrests the free-floating refer­
ence of the alten terms only relatively to the free-floating reference of o ur
own terms, by linking thc two.
The point is not that we ourselves are casting a bout in vain for a
mooring. Staying a hoard our own language and not rocking the boat,
we are horne smoothly along o n it and all is well; 'rabbit' denotes rah­
bits, and therc i s no sense i n asking 'Rabbit> in what sense of "rabbit" ? '
Reference goes inscrutable if, rocking t h e boat, w e contemplate a permu­

F. P. Ramsey u rged this point fifty years ago, a rguing along other lines,
and in a vague way it had been a persistent theme also in Russell's A naiy­
sis 0/ Matter. But Ramsev and Russell were talking only of what they
called theoretical objects, as opposed to observahle objects.
I extend the doctrine to obj ects geoera lly, for I sec all obj ects as theo­
retical. This i s a consequence of taking seriously the insight that I traced
from Bentham-namely, the semantic primacy of sentences. It i s oc­
casion sentcnces, not ternlS, that arc to be secn as conditioned to stimu­
lations. Even our primordial obj ects, bodies, arc a l ready theoretical­
most conspicuouslv so when we look to thei r individuation over time.
Whether we encounter the same apple the next time .Hound, or only an­
other one like it, i s settled i f at all by inference from ,1 network of hy­
potheses that we have internalized l ittle bv little in the course of acq uir­
ing the nonohservational <;L1perstructure of O llr l a n guage.
It is occasion sentences that report the ohservations on which science
rests. ·rhe scientific output is l ikewise sententia l : true sentences, we hope,
truths ahout nature. The obj ects, Or values of variables, serve merely as
indices along the way, and we mav permute o r supplant them as we
please as long as the sentence-tn-sentence structure i s preserved. The sci­
entific system, ontology and all, i s a conceptual bri dge of o u r own mak­
ing� linking sensory stinl u l ation to sensory stimulation. [ ;] In repeating
what I said at th e beginning.
But I also expressed, at the beginning, mv unswerving belief in exter­
nal things-people, nerve endings, sticks, stones. This I reaffirm. I be­
lieve also, if less firmly, in atoms and electrons ,md in classes. Now how

245

246

QUINTESSENCE

is "II this robust realism to be reconciled with the barren scene that I
have j ust been depicting? The answer is naturalism: the recognition that
it is within science itself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is
to be identified and described.
'rhe semantical considerations that seemed to undermine all this were
concerned not with assessing reality but with analyzing method and evi­
dence. They belong not to ontology but to the methodology of ontology,
and thus to epistemology. Those considerations showed that I could in­
deed turn my back on my external things and classes and ride the proxy
functions to something strange and different without doing violence to
any evidence. But all ascription of reality must come rather from within
one's theory of the world; it is incoherent otherwise.
!vly methodological talk of proxy functions and inscrutability of refer­
ence must be seen as natural istic too; it likewise is no part of a first phi­
losophy prior to science. The setting is still the physical world, seen in
terms of the global science to which, with minor variations, we all sub­
scribe. Amid a\l this there are our sensory receptors and the bodies near
and far whose emanations impinge on our receptors. Epistemology, for
me, or what comes nearest to it, is the study of how we animals can have
contrived that very science, given j ust that sketchy neural input. It is this
study that reveals that displacements of our ontology through proxy
functions would have measured up to that neural input no less faithfully.
To recognize this is not to repudiate the ontology in terms of which the
recogn ition took place.
We can repudiate it. We are free to switch, without doing violence to
any evidence. If we switch, then this epistemological remark itself under­
goes appropriate reinterpretation too; nerve endings and other things
give way to appropriate proxies, again without straining any evidence.
But it is a confusion to suppose that we can stand aloof and recognize all
the alternative ont ologies as true in their several ways, a\l the envisaged
worlds as real. It is a confusion of truth with evidential support. Truth is
imma nent, and there is no higher. We must speak from within a theory,
albeit any of various.
Transcendental argument, or what purports to be first philosophy,
tends generally to rake on rather this status of immanent epistemology
in sofar as I s llcceed in making sense of it. What evaporates is the tran­
scendental question of the reality of the external world-the question
whether or i n how far our science measures up to the D ing an sich.
Our scientific theory can indeed go wrong, and precisely in the famil-

rhll1g� a n d Their Place

iar way: through failure of predIcted observation. But what I f, happily
and unheknownst, we have achIeved a theory that is confo rmahle to ev­
ery possihle observation, past and future ? [n what sense could the world
then be said to deviate from what the theory claim s ? C1earlv in none,
even if we call somehow make sense of the phrase 'every possible ohser­
vatio n . ' Our overall scientific theory demands of the world only tlldt it
be so structured as to assure the seq uences of stimulation that our theorv
gives u s to expect. More concrete demands a re empty, what with the
freedom of proxy functions.
Radical skepticism stems from the sort of confusion I have all uded to ,
but is not of Itself incoherent. Science is v u l nerable to illUSIon on Its own
showing, what with seeminglY bent sticks in water and the like, and the
skeptic may be seen merely as overre,lcting when he repudi ates science
across the hoard. Experience might still take a turn that wOllld j ustify his
dou bts ahout external objects. Our s uccess in predicting observations
might fall off sharply, and concomitantly with this we might begin to be
somewhat successful in hasing predictions upon dreams or reveries. At
that point we might reasonably doubt our theory of nature in even b i rly
broad outlines. But o u r dou bts would still he i mmanent, and of a pIece
with the scientific endeavor.
My attitude toward the project of a rational recomtruction of the
world from sense data is similarly naturalistic. I do not regard the pro j ­
ect as incoherent, though i t s motivation in some cases is confused. [ see it
as a proj ect of positing a realm of entities intimately related to the stimu­
lation of the sensory surfaces, and then, with the help periu p' o f an aux­
iliary realm of entities in set theory, proceeding hy contextual definltJon
to construct a language adequate to natural science. It i, an attractive
idea, for it would bring scientific d iscourse into a much more e x p l icit
and systematic relation to its o bservati onal checkpoints . .vl y only reser­
vation is that I am convinced, regretfu l l y, that it cannot be done.
Another notion that [ would take pains to rescue from the a hyss of the
transcendental is the notion of a matter o f fact. A place where the notion
proves relevant is in connection with my doctrine of the indeterminacy
of transl ation. I have argued that two conflicting manu a l s of translation
can both do j ustice to all dispositions to behavior, and tbat, i n such a
case, there is no fact of the matter of which manual is right. The intended
notion of matter of fact is not transcendent a l or yet epistell1 o l oglcal , not
even a q u estIon of evidence; i t is ontologica l, a question of reality, and to
he taken naturalistically within o u r scientific theory of the world. Thus

247

248

QUINTESSENCE

suppose, to make things vivid, that we are settling still for a physics of el­
ementary particles and recognizing a dozen or so basic states and rela­
tions in which they may stand. Then when I say there is no fact of the
matter, as regards, say, the two rival manuals of translation, what r mean
is that both manuals are compatible with all the same distributions of
states and relations over elementary particles. In a word, they are physi­
cally equivalent. Needless to say, there is no presumption of our being
able to sort out the pertinent distributions of microphysical states and
relations. r speak of a physical condition and not an empirical criterion.
It is in the same seme that r say there is no fact of the matter of our in­
terpreting any man's ontol ogy i n one way or, via proxy functions, in an­
other. Any man's, that is to say, except ourselves. We can switch our own
ontology too without doing vio lence to any evidence, but in so doing we
switch from our elementary particles to some manner of proxies and
thus reinterpret our standard of what counts as a fact of the matter. Fac­
tuality, like gravitation and electric charge, is internal to our theory of
nature.

O N C A R N A P ' S V I E W S O N O NT O L O G Y

Though n o o n e has influenced m y philosophical thought more than
Carnap, a n issue has persisted between us for years over questions of on­
tology a n d analyticity. These questions prove to be i nterrelated; their in­
terrelations come out especi ally clearly in Carnap's paper " E mpiricism,
Semantics, and O ntology. " I shall devote particular attention to that one
paper in a n effort to isolate and reduce our divergences .
When I inquire into the ontological commitments of a given doctrine
or body of theory, I a m merely asking what, according to that theory,
there is. I might say in passing, though it is no s ubstantial point of dis­
agreement, that Carnap does not much like my terminology here. Now if
he had a better use for this fine old word 'onto logy,' I should be inclined
to cast abont for another word for my own meaning. But th e fact is, I be­
lieve, that be disapproves o f my giving meaning to a word which helongs
to traditional metaphysics and should therefore be meaningless. Now
my ethics of terminology deman d , o n occasi o n , the avoidance of ,1 word
for given purposes when the word has been preem pted in a prior mean­
ing; meaningless words, however, are precisely the words which I feel
freest to specify meanings for. But actually my adoption of the word 'on­
tology' for the purpose described is not as arbitrary as 1 make it sound.
Though n o champion o f tradition a l metaphysics, I suspect th at the sense
i n which I use this crusty old word has been nuclear to its usage all
along.
Let us agree, for the space of my remarks, on the word . The question
of the ontological commitments of a theory, then, is the q uestion what,
according to that theory, there is. Carnap thinks-and here is a more
than terminological issue-that the question what a theory presu pposes
that there is should be divided into two qLrestions in a certa i n way; and [
249

250

QUINTESSENCE

disagree. What he thinks the division should he, and why I disagree, will
appear soon; hut first let us examine the undivided idea a hit.
It has not always been clear how to decide whether or not a given dis­
course involves commitment to a given alleged entity. When we say that
all fish a re aq uatic, do we commit ourselves to the acceptance of two ab­
stract entities, two classes or properties, named by the words 'fish' and
'aquatic ' ? When we use the word 'similar, ' without defining it in any an­
terior terms, do we thereby commit ourselves to the acceptance of an ab­
stract entity which is the relation of similarity ? Russell has said that we
do. But no nominalist would agree.
Every nominalist, every user of language, avails himself freely of gen­
eral terms such as 'fish' and 'aquatic' and 'similar'; but only anti-nomi­
nalists imagine in such usage any allusion to abstract entities. The nomi­
nalist holds that the word 'fish' is true of each concrete fish, but that it
docs not, in addition, name an a bstract fishhood or class of fish; and that
the word 'similar' is true of each alligator with respect to each crocodile,
and true of each Pontiac with respect to each Pontiac, but that it does
not, in addition, name a relation of similarity. Why should 'fish' or
'aquatic' or 'similar' be put on a par with names such as 'Chicago' and
'Truman' and 'Parthenon ' ? Many words a r e admissible in significant
sentences without claiming to name; witness 'the' and 'of' and 'sake' and
'ki lter. ' Why not 'fish' and 'aquatic' and 'simil a r ' ?
Perhaps we can convict a speaker of commitment to a hstract enti­
ties not through his general terms, hut only through his a bstract terms
such as 'fishhood,' 'aquaticity, ' 'similarity ' ? B u t this is no feasihle resting
place. I f YOll grant the nominalist his general terms, he can excuse his use
of a bstract terms as picturesque paraphrasing of what could be said in
general terms.
All th is tolerance of language and waiving of commitments is reason­
able enough, but is there no end to i t ? The words ' Chicago' and 'Tru­
man' and 'Parthenon' could themselves be excused in the same spirit, as
admissible in sentences without claiming to name. There would appear
to be no such thing as commitment to entities through discourse.
I think it is true that there is no commitment to entities through use of
alleged names of them; other things being equal, we can a lways deny the
a l legation that the words in question are names. But still there is cer­
tainly commitment to entities through discourse; for we arc quite capa­
ble of saying in so many words that there are black swans, that there is a
mountain lllore than 8 8 0 0 meters high, and that there are prime num-

On Carna p's Vil'w� on Ontology

bers a bove a hundred. Saying these things, we also say by implication
that there are physical obj ects and a bstract entities; for all the black
swans are physical objects and all the prime numbers above a hundred
are a bstract entities.
Thus J consider that the essential commitment to entities of any sort
comes through the variables of quantification and not through the use of
alleged names. The entities to which a discourse commits us arc the enti­
ties over which our variables of quantification have to range in order
that the statements a ffirmed in that discourse be true.
Names arc a red herring. The use of alleged names, we have seen, is no
commitment to corresponding entities. Conversely, through our vari­
ables of quantification we are quite capable of committing ourselves to
entities which cannot be named individually at all i n the resources of our
language; witness the real numbers, which, according to classical theory,
constitute a larger infinity than does the totality of constructible names
in any language. Names, in fact, can be dispensed with altogether in fa­
vor of lI11naming general terms, plus quantification and other logical de­
vices; the trick of accomplishing this elimination is provided, in its main
lines, by Russell's theory of descriptions. Thenceforward the variable of
quantification becomes the sole channel of reference . For ontological
commitment it is the variable that counts.
I f J understand correctly, Carnap accepts my standard for j u dging
whether a given theory accepts given a lleged entities. The test is whether
the variables of q uantification have to include those entities in their
range in order to make the theory true . Allow, of course, for a shudder
between the word 'ontological' and the word 'commitment. '
Now t o determine what entities a given theory presupposes i s one
thing, and to determine what entities a theory should be allowed to pre­
suppose, what entities there really are, is another. It is especially in the
latter connection that Carnap urges the dichotomy which J said I would
talk a bo ut. On one side of his dichotomy he puts the question of there
being black swans, or mountains more than R 8 0 0 meters, or prime num­
bers above a hundred; on the other side the question of there being phys­
ical objects or abstract entities. The distinction depends on what he calls
a /ramework:
I f someone wishes to speak i n h i s language about a n e w kind of entities,
he has to introduce a system of n e w ways of speaking, s ubje ct to new
rules; we shall call this procedure the construction of a /ramework for

the new entities i n question. And now we must d i stinguish two k i n d s of
questions of existence: first, q uestions of the exi stence of certain e ntities
of the new kind

within the framework; we

call them

mternal questions;
the frame­

and secon d, q uestions concerning the existence or reality of

work itself,

c a l led

external questions .

. . . Let u s consider a s a n example

the simplest fra mework dealt with in the everyday language: the spatio­
temporal l y ordered system of observable things a n d events. O nce we
have accepted this thing language and thereby the framework of things,
we can raise a n d answer internal questions, e . g . , ' I s there a white p i ece
of paper o n m y desk ? , ' ' D i d King Arth u r actually l i ve ? , ' 'Are unicorns
and centaurs real o r merely imaginary ? , ' and the l i k e . These questions
are to be a n swered by empirical i n vestiga tions .
. . . From these questions we m us t distinguish the extern a l question
of the rea l ity of the thing world itself. In contrast to the former ques­
tions, this question i s raised neither b y the m a n in the street n o r by sci­
entists, but o n l y by p h i losophers . . . . those who raise the q uestion of
the reality of the thing world itself have perhaps in m i n d not a theoreti­
c a l question a s their form ulation seems to suggest, b u t rather a practi­
cal question, a matter of a practical decision concerning the structure of
our language. We have to make the choice whether or not to accept and
use the forms of expression for the fra mework in question .

. . . If someone deCIdes to accept the thing la nguage, there is no ob­
jection against saying that he has accepted the world of things. But this
m u s t not be interpreted a s i f it meant h i s acceptance of a

belief in the re­

a l ity of the thing world; there is no such belief or a ssertion or assump­
tion, beca use it i s not a theoretical question. To accept the thing world
m e a n s nothing more than to accept a cert a i n form of language . '
Let u s re c a l l n o w m y a c c o u n t o f wherein the c o u nte n a n c ing o f entities
consists. It c o n sists i n the inclusion o f them within the range or ranges of
the v a r i a b l e s o f q uantificati o n . Accordingly Carnap descri bes the intro­
duction of a framework a s c o n s isting e s sentia l l y i n these two steps:
First, the introduction of a general term, a predicate of higher level, for
the new k i n d of entities, permitting u s to say of a ny p a rtic u l a r entity
that i t belongs to t h i s kind ( e . g . , 'Red i s a

property, '

' F ive i s a

number ' ) .

Second, the introduction o f variables o f the new type. The new entities

1. Rudolf Carnap, " EmpIriCISm, Semantics, and Ontology, " R evue InternatlOnale
de Phtlosophle 4 ( 1 95 0 ) .

On Carnap's Views on Ontology

are values of these variables; the constants (and the closed compound
expressions, if any) are substitutable for the variables. With the help of
the variables, general sentences concerning the new entities can be for­
Ill u lated.'
It begins to appear, then, that Carnap's dichotomy of questions of
existence is a dichotomy between questions o f the form " Are there so­
and-so's ? " where the so-and-so's purport to exhaust the range of a par­
ticular style of bound variables, and questions of the form " Are there so­
and-so's ? " where the so-and-so's do not purport to exhaust the range o f
a particular style of bound variables. L e t me ca l l t h e former questions
category questions, and the latter ones subclass questions. I need this
new terminology beca use Carnap's terms 'external' and 'internal' draw a
somewhat different distinction which is derivative from the distinction
between category questions and subclass questions. The exteroal q ues­
tions arc the category questions conceived as propounded before the
adoption of a given language; and they are, Carnal' holds, properly to
be construed as questions of the desirability of a given language form.
The internal questions comprise the subclass questions and, in addition,
the category questions when these arc construed as treated within an
adopted language as questions having trivially analytic or contradictory
answers. '
BlIt now I want to examine the dichotomy which, as we see, underlies
Carnap's distinction of external and internal, and which I am phrasing
as the distinction betwee n category q u estions and subclass questions. It
is evident that the question whether there are numbers will be a category
question only with respect to languages which appropriate a separate
style of variables for the excl usive purpose of referring to numbers. If
our language refers to numbers through variables which also take classes
other than numbers as values, then the question whether there are num­
hers becomes a suhclass question, on a par with the question whether
there are primes over a hundred. This will be the situation i n the lan­
guage of Prmci/Jia Mathematica and in the languages o f a l l the other fa­
miliar set theories.
Even the question whether there are classes, or whether there are
physical ohj ects, becomes a subclass question i f our language uses a sin­
gle style of variables to range over both sorts of entities. Whether the

253

254

QUINTESSENCE

statement that there are physical obj ects and the statement that there
are black swans should be put on the same side of the dichotomy, or on
opposite sides, comes to depend on the rather trivial considerati on o f
whether we u s e o n e style of variables or t w o f o r physical objects a n d
classes.
I must now explain why r call this a rather trivial consideration. The
use of different styles of varia hIes for different ranges is common in
mathematics, but can usually be explained as a casual and eliminable
shorthand: instead of prefacing various of our statements with the words
'If x is a real number between 0 and I, then,' we may find it convenient
for the space of a chapter or a book of probahility theory to reserve spe­
cia I letters 'p', 'q' , 'r' to the real numhers between 0 and I. The differ­
ence between using the explicit hypothesis ' x is a real number between 0
and l ' and introducing the restricted variables is so negligible that at the
level of ordinary mathematical writing it cannot usually he detected; nor
is there any reason why it should be detected.
But Carnap does not have j ust this trivial distinction in mind. He is
thinking of languages which contain fundamentally segregated styles of
varia hIes before any definitional abbreviations; and he is thinking of
styles of variables which are sealed off from one another so utterly that it
is commonly ungrammatical to usc a variable of one style where a vari­
able of another style would be grammatical. A language which exploits
this sort of basic compartmentalization of variables is that of Russell's
theory of logical types. However, I think many of us overstress the the­
ory of types to the neglect of its coeval alternative, Zermelo's set theory,
and its descendants. In a notation of the latter tradition, carrying no dis­
tinctions in styles of variables, all questions regarding the acceptance not
only of numbers in general but of a bstract entities in general, or of physi­
cal ohj ects in general, would become subclass questions-j ust as genu­
inely so as the question of there being black swans and prime num bers
above a hundred. Thus Carnap's distinction between internal and exter­
nal, based as it is upon a distinction between category questions and sub­
class questions, is of little concern to us apart from the adoption of
something like the theory of types. I am one of those who have tended
for many years not to adopt the theory of types.
Actually the case is a little worse than r have thus far represented
it. Even if we adopt the theory of types we remain frce to adopt the
course which Russell himself adopted under the name of tY/Jicai amhigu­
ity-thus ahandoning the use of a distinctive style of variables for every

On Carnap's Views on Ontology

type. Russell uses his device in moderation, but we can go farther and
use j ust a single style of varia bles for all types. The theory of types re­
mains in force in this way: only those formulas are admitted as gram­
matical which could, hy a one-to-one rewriting of variables, be turned
into meaningful formulas of explicit type theory with distinctive styles of
variables for all types.
This sort of indirect conformity to the theory of types, on the part of
formulas written with a single style of variables, is a feature which I have
called stratification; and it can be defined also directly, without any ap­
peal to a supposedly more fundamental notation involving distinctive
styles of variables . Stratification is simply freedom, on the part of the
varia bles in a formula, from certain repetition patterns in connection
with the symbol of class membership.
Next we can even abandon Russell's notion of a hierarchical universe
of entities disposed into logical types; nothing remains of type theory ex­
cept an ultimate grammatical restriction on the sorts of repetition pat­
terns which variables are allowed to exhibit in formulas. Yet formally
our logic, refurbished as described, is indistinguishable from Russell's
theory of types plus Russell's convention of typical ambiguity. Now the
point of this logical digression is that even under the theory of types the
use of distinctive styles of variables, explicitly or even implicitly, is the
most casual editorial detail.
J argued before that the distinction between category questions and
subclass questions is of little concern apart fro m the adoption of some­
thing like the theory of types. But what I now think to have shown is that
it is of little concern even under the theory of types. It is a distinction
which is not invariant under logically irrelevant changes of typography.
I have doubly warranted hopes of persuading Carnap to abandon this
particular distinction. First, as argued, J find it ill grounded. But second,
also, J think it is a distinction which he can perfectly well discard com­
patibly with the philosophical purpose of the paper under discussion.
No more than the distinction between analytic and synthetic is needed
in support of Carnap's doctrine that the statements commonly thought
of as ontological, viz., statements such as 'There are physical objects,'
There are classes,' 'There are numbers,' are analytic or contradictory
given the language. No more than the distinction hetween analytic and
synthetic is needed in support of his doctrine that the statements com­
monly thought of as ontological are proper matters of contention only in
the form of linguistic proposals. The contrast which he wants between

255

256

QUINTESSENCE

those ontological statements and empirical existence statements such as
'There are black swans' is clinched by the distinction of analytic and syn­
thetic. True, there is in these terms no contrast between analytic state­
ments of an ontological kind and other analytic statements of existence
such as 'There are prime numbers above a hundred'; but I don't see why
he should care about this.
However, this is not an end of my dissent. On the contrary, the basic
point of contention has j ust emerged : the distinction between analytic
and synthetic itself. Carnap correctly states in a footnote:
Q uine does not acknowledge the distinction which I emphasize above
[viz., the distinction between ontological questions and factual ques­
tions of existenceJ , because according t o h i s general conception there
are no sharp boundary lines between logical and factual truth, between
questions of meaning and questions of fact, between the acceptance of
a language structure and the acceptance of an assertion formulated in
the language.
I have set down my misgivings regarding the distinction between ana­
lytic and synthetic in a recent paper, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism, " and
will not retrace those steps here. Let me merely stress the consequence: if
there is no proper distinction between analytic and synthetic, then no ba­
sis at all remains for the contrast which Carnap urges between ontologi­
cal statements and empirical statements of existence. Ontological ques­
tions then end up on a par with questions of natural science .
Within natural science there is a continuum of gradations, from the
statements which report observations to those which reflect basic fea­
tures say of quantum theory or the theory of relativity. The view which I
end up with, in the paper last cited, is that statements of ontology or
even of mathematics and logic form a continuation of this continuum, a
continuation which is perhaps yet more remote from observation than
are the central principles of quantum theory or relativity. The differences
here arc in my view differences only in degree and not in kind. Science is
a unified structure, and in principle it is the structure as a whole, and not
its component statements one hy one, that experience confirms or shows
to be imperfect. Carnap maintains that ontological questions, and like­
wise questions of logical or mathematical principle, are questions not of
fact but of choosing a convenient conceptual scheme or framework for
science; and with this r agree only if the same be conceded for every sci­
entific hypothesis.

IV
EPISTEMOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY OF MIND

E P I S T E M O L O G Y N AT U R A L I Z E D

Epistemology is concerned with the foundations of science. Conceived
thus hroadly, epistemology includes the study of the foundations of
mathematics as one of its departments. Specialists at the turn of the cen­
tury thought that their efforts in this particular department were achiev­
ing nota hIe success: mathematics seemed to reduce altogether to logic. In
a more recent perspective this reduction is seen to he hetter descrihable
as a reduction to logic and set theory. This correction is a disappoint­
ment epistemologically, since the firmness and obviousness that we asso­
ciate with logic cannot be claimed for set theory. But still the success
achieved in the foundations of mathematics remains exemplary by com­
pa rative standards, and we can illuminate the rest of epistemology some­
what by drawing parallels to this department.
Studies in the foundations of mathematics divide symmetrically into
two sorrs, conceptual and doctrinal. The conceptual studies are con­
cerned with meaning, the doctrinal with truth. The conceptual studies
arc concerned with clarifying concepts by defining them, some in terms
of others. 'T'he doctrinal studies are concerned with establishing laws by
proving them, some on the basis of others. Ideally the obscurer concepts
would be defined in terms of the clearer ones so as to maximize clarity,
and the less obvious laws would be proved from the more obvious ones
so as to maximize certainty. Ideally the definitions would generate all the
concepts from clear and distinct ideas, and the proofs would generate all
the theorems from self-evident truths.
The two Ideals are linked. For, if you define all the concepts by use of
some favored subset of them, you thereby show how to translate all the­
orems into these favored terms. The clearer these terms are, the likelier it
is that the truths couched in them will be obviously true, or derivable
259

260

QUINTESSENCE

from obvious truths. If in particular the concepts of mathematics were
all reducible to the clear terms of logic, then all the truths of mathemat­
ics would go over into truths of logic; and surely the truths of logic are
all obvious or at least potentially obvious, i.e., derivable from o bvious
truths by individually obvious steps.
This particular outcome is in fact denied us, however, since mathemat­
ics reduces only to set theory and not to logic proper. Such reduction still
enhances clarity, but only because of the interrelations that emerge and
not because the end terms of the analysis are clearer than others. As for
the end truths, the axioms of set theory, these have less o bviousness and
certainty to recommend them than do most of the mathematical theo­
rems that we would derive from them. Moreover, we know from Gadet's
work that no consistent axiom system can cover mathematics even when
we renounce self-evidence. Reduction in the foundations of mathematics
remains mathematically and philosophically fascinating, bur it does not
do what the epistemologist would like of it: it does not reveal the ground
of mathematical knowledge, it does not show how mathematical cer­
tainty is possible.
Still there remains a helpful thought, regarding epistemology gener­
ally, in that duality of structure which was especially conspicuous in the
foundations of mathematics. I refer to the bifurcation into a theory of
concepts, or meaning, and a theory of doctrine, or truth; for this applies
to the epistemology of natural knowledge no less than to the founda­
tions of mathematics. The parallel is as follows. Just as mathematics is to
be reduced to logic, or logic and set theory, so natural knowledge is to be
based somehow on sense experience. This means explaining the notion
of body in sensory terms; here is the conceptual side. And it means j usti­
fying our knowledge of truths of nature in sensory terms; here is the doc­
trinal side of the bifurcation.
Hume pondered the epistemology of natural knowledge on both sides
of the bifurcation, the conceptual and the doctrinal. His handling of
the conceptual side of the problem, the explanation of body in sensory
terms, was bold and simple: he identified bodies outright with the sense
impressions. If common sense distinguishes between the material apple
and our sense impressions of it on the ground that the apple is one and
enduring while the impressions are many and fleeting, then, Hume held,
so much the worse for common sense; the notion of its being the salll e
apple on one occasion and another is a vulgar confusion.
Nearly a century after Hume's TreatIse, the same view of bodies was

EpIstemology N;)tLlra i llcd

espoused by the early American philosopher Alexander Bryan Johnson. '
"The word iron names an associated sight and fec i , " Johnson wrote.
What then of the doctrinal side, the j ustification o f our knowledge of
truths ahout nature ? Here, Hume despaired. By his identification of bod­
ies with impressions he did succeed in construing some singular state­
ments about bodies as indubitable truths, ves; as truths about impres­
sions, directly k n own. But general statements, also singular statements
about the future, gained no increment of certainty by being construed as
about impressions.
O n the doctrinal side, I do not see that we are farther along today than
where Hume left us. The Humean predicament is the human predica­
ment. But on the conceptual side there has been progress . There the cru­
cial step forwa rd was made already before A lexander Bryan J ohnson's
day, although Johnson did not emulate it. It was made by Bentham in
his theory of fictions. Bentham's step was the recognition of contextual
definition, or what he called paraph rasis. I Ie recognized that to explain a
term we do not need to specify an object for it to refer to, nor even spec­
ify a synonymous word or phrase; we need only show, hy whatever
means, how to translate all the whole sentences in which the term is to
he used. Hume's and Johnson's desperate measure of identifying bodies
with impressions ceased to be the only conceivable way o f making sense
of talk of bodies, even granted that impressions werc the only rea lity.
One could undertake to explain talk of bodies in terms of talk of impres­
sions by translating one's whole sentences about hodies into whole sen­
tences about impressions, without equating the bodies themselves to
anything at all.
This idea of contextual definition, or recognition of the sentence as the
primary vehicle of meaning, was indispensable to the ensuing develop­
ments in the foundations of mathematics. It was explicit in !' rege, and it
attained its full flower in Russell's doctrine o f singular descriptions as in­
complete symbols.
Contextual definition was one of two resorts that could be expected to
have a liberating effect upon the conceptual side of the epistemology of
natural knowledge. The other is resort to the resources of set theory as
auxiliary concepts. The epistemologist who is willing to eke out his aus­
tere ontology of sense impressions with these set-theoretic auxiliaries is
suddenlv rich: he has not j ust his impressions to play with, hut sets of

them, and sets of sets, and so on up. Constructions in the foundations of
mathematics have shown that such set-theoretic aids arc a powerful ad­
dition; after all, the entire glossary of concepts of classical mathemarics
is constructible from them. Thus equipped, our epistemologist may not
need either to identify bodies with impressions or to settle for contextual
definition; he may hope to find in some subtle construction of sets upon
sets of sense impressions a category of objects enj oying j ust the formula
properties that he wants for bodies.
The two resorts are very lInequal in epistemological status. Contex­
tual definition is unassailable. Sentences that have been given meaning as
wholes arc undeniably meaningful, and the usc they make of their com­
ponent terms is therefore meaningful, regardless of whether any transla­
tions are offered for those terms in isolation. Surely flume and A. B.
Johnson would have used contextua l definition with pleasure if they had
thought o f it. Recourse to sets, on the other hand, is a drastic ontological
move, a retreat from the austere ontology of impressions. There are phi­
losophers who would rather settle for bodies outright than accept all
these sets, which amount, after all, to the whole a bstract ontology of
mathematics.
This issue has not always been clear, however, owing to deceptive
hints of continuity between elementary logic and set theory. Th is is why
mathematics was once believed to reduce to logic, that is, to an innocent
and unquestionable logic, and to inherit these qualities. And this is prob­
ably why Russell was content to resort to sets as well as to contextual
definition when in Our Knowledge of the External World and elsewhere
he addressed himself to the epistemology of natural knowledge, on its
conceptual side.
To account for the external world as a logical construct of sense
data-such, in Russell's terms, was the program. It was Carnap, in his
Der logischc Aufbau der Welt of 1 92 8 , who came nearest to executing it.
This was the conceptual side of epistemology; what of the doctrinal?
There the Humean predicament remained unaltered. Carnap's construc­
tions, if carried successfully to completion, would have enabled us to
translate all sentences about the world into terms of sense data, or obser­
vation, plus logic and set theory. But the Ill e re fact that a sentence is
couched in terms of observation, logic, and set theory does not mean
that it can be proved from observation sentences by logic and set theory.
The most modest of generalizations about observable traits will cover
more cases than its utterer can have had occasion actually to observe.

EpI�tcm()l()gy Natur;:dlzed

The hopelessness of grounding natural science upon immediate experI­
ence in a firmly logical way was acknowledged. The Ca rtesian quest for
certainty had been the remote motivation of epistemology, both O il its
conceptual and its doctrinal side; but that quest was seen as a lost cause.
To endow the truths of nature with the full authoritv of immediate expe­
rience was as forlorn a hope as hoping to endow the truths of mathemat­
ics with the potential obviousness of elementary logic.
What then could have motivated Carnap's heroic efforts on the con­
ceptua l side of epistemology, when hope of certainty on the doctrinal
side was abandoned? There were two good reasons still. O n e was that
such constructions could be expected to elicit and clarify the sensory eVI­
dence for science, even if the inferential steps hetween sensory evidence
and scientific doctrine must fall short of certainty. 'fh e other reason was
that s uch constructions would deepen our understanding of our dis­
course about the world, even apart from questions of evidence; it would
make a ll cognitive discourse as clear as o bservation terms and logic and,
I must regretfully add, set theory.
It was sad for epistemologists, Hume and others, to have to acquiesce
in the impossihility of strictly deriving the science of the external world
from sensory evidence. Two cardinal tenets of empiricism remained un­
assailable, however, and so remain to this day. One is that whatever evi­
dence there IS for science is sensory evidence. The other, to which I shall
recur, is that all inculcation of meanings of words must rest ultimately on
sensory evidence. Hence the continuing attractiveness of the idea of a
log/scher Aufhau in which the sensory content of discourse would stand
forth explicitly.
If Carnap had successfully carried such a construction th rough, how
could he have told whether it was the right one? The question would
have had no point. He was seeking what he called a rational reconstruc­
tion. Any construction of physicalistic discourse in terms of sense experi­
ence, l ogic, and set theory would have been seen as satisfactory if it made
the physicalistic discourse come out right. If there is one wav there are
many, bur any would be a great achievement.
But why all this creative reconstruction, all this make-believe ? The
stimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anyhody has had
to go 0 1 1 , ultimately, in arriving at his picture of the world. Why not j ust
see how th is construction really proceeds ? Why not settle for psychol­
ogy ? Such a surrender of the epistemological burden to psychology i s a
move that was disallowed in earlier times as circular reasoning. If the

epistemologist's goal " va"LLltIon of the grounds of empirIcal science, he
defeats hIS purpose by m l ll g psychologv or other empirical science i n the
valIdatio n . Ifowever, s uch scruples against circula ritv have little poi n t
once we have stopped dreaming of deducing science from observations.
If we a re (Jut sl111 ply to understand the link between o bservation and sci­
ence, we Me well advised to usc any available information, including
that prm'lded by the very science whose link with observation we a re
seek ing to understa n d .
But there remaim a di fferent reason, u nconnected with fea rs of circu­
I a ritv, for stdl favoring creatIve reeomtructio n . We should like to be ab l e
t o trans/ute sCIence m t o logic ,l ml observation terms and set theory. This
would be a great epi stemological ach ievement, for it would show all the
rest ot the conceph of sCIence to be theoretically superfluous. It would
I egltIml!.c thcm-to whatever degree thc concepts of sct theory, logic,
and observation are themselves legitimate-by showing that everything
done WIth thc one app.uatm could In principle be done with the other. If
psychology itself cou l d deliver a truly translationa l reduction of this
kind, we shou ld welcome it; but certain I v it cannot, for certainly w e did
not grow up learnmg definitions of physicalistic language i n terms of a
prior language of set theory, logic, and observation. I lere, then, would
be good rca�()n for persisting in a rational reconstruction: we want to es­
tabli,h the e'5enti a l , nnocence of phvsical concepts, by showing them to
be theoretIcally di'pensa ble.
The fact is, thoug h , tlut the comtruction which Carnap outlined in
Der /oglsche Auf/hili der Welt does not give translational reduction ei­
ti,er. It would not even I f the outline were fi l led i n . 'rhe cruci al point
comes where Carnap i, expla ining how to assign sensc qual ities to posi­
tions in physical space and time. These assignments a re to he made in
such a wav ,1, to fu lfill, as well as pos,ible, certain desiderata which he
states, and with growth of experience the assignments a re to be revised
to suit. This plan, however i l l uminating, does not offer any key to trans­
/dtll1g the ,entenee, of science into terms of o bservation, logic, and set
theory.
We must de,pair of any ,uch reductIon. Carnap had despaired of it by
1 9 3 6 , when, In "Testa b i l I ty ,1l1d .\1eaning, '" he introduced so-called re­
duction fClrm, of a type weaker than definition. Definitions had shown
always how to tram l a te sentence, into equivalent sentences. Contextual

definition of a term showed how to translate sentences conta ining the
term into equivalent sentences lacking the term. Reduction fonm of
Carnap's liheralized kind, on the other hand, do not in general give
equivalences; they giv·e implications. They explain ,1 new term, if only
partially, by specifying some sentences willch arc impl ied by sentences
containing the term, and other sentences which imply sentences contain­
ing the term.
It is tempting to suppose that the countenancing of reduction forms in
this liberal sense is j ust one further step of li beralization com para hie to
the earlier one, taken hy Bentham, of counten ancing contextual defini­
tion. ·rhe fonner and sterner kind of rational recomtruction might have
heen represented as a fictitious history in which we i magined our ances­
tors introducing the terms of phvsic" listic discourse on a phenomenal­
istic and set-theoretic basis bv a succession of contextual definitions. The
new and more l i heral kind of rational recomtruction is a fictitiou s his­
tory in which we imagine our ancestors introducing those teflns hy a
succession rather of red uction forms of the weaker sort.
This, however, is a wrong comparison. The fact i s rather that the for­
mer and sterner kind of rational reconstruction, where definition
reigned, embodied no fictitious history at a l l . It was nothing more nor
less than a set of di rections-or would have heen, i f successful-for ac­
complishing everything in terms of phenomena and set theory that we
now accomplish in terms o f bodies. It would have heen " true reduction
by translation , a legiti mation by elimi nation . De{inire est climtnare. Ra­
tional reconstruction by Canu p 's later and looser reduction forms does
none of this.
To relax the demand for definition, and settle for a kind of reduction
that does not eliminate, is to renounce the last remaining advantage that
we supposed rational reconstruction to have over straight psychologv;
namely, the advantage of translational reducti on. If all we hope for is a
reconstruction that links science to experience in explicit ways short of
translation, then it would seem more sensi ble to settle for psychology.
Better to discover how science is in fact developed and learned th an to
fa bricate a fictitiou> structure to a similar effect.
·rhe empiricist made one major concession when he despa ired of de­
ducing the truths of nature from sensory evidence. [ n despairing now
even of translating those truths into terms of observation and logico­
mathematical auxiliaries, he makes another major concession. For snp­
pose we hold, with the old empiricist Peirce, that the very meaning of a

2(15

266

QU1NTFSSENCF

statement consists lfl the d Ifference Its truth would make to possible ex­
perience. Might we not formulate, lfl ,1 chapter-length sentence i n obser­
vational i.:tnguage, all the d i fference that the truth of a given statement
might make to experience, and might we not then take all this as the
translati o n ? Even i f the di fference that the truth of the statement would
make to experience ramifies indefinitely, we might still hope to embrace
it all in the logical implications of our chapter-length formulation, j ust as
we can axiomatize an infinity of theorems. In giving up hope of such
tralblation, then, the empi ricist is conceding that the empirical meanings
of typical stenements about the external world :lre inaccessible and inef­
fa ble.
How is this ill3ccessibiltty to be explained? SI mply o n the ground that
the expenential implications of a typic.1 1 statement about bodies arc too
complex for finite axiomatization, however lengthy? No; I have a differ­
ent explanation. It is that the typical statement about bodies has no fund
of experiential implications it can call Its own. A. su bstantial mass of the­
ory, taken together, will commonly have experiential implications; this is
how we make verifiable predictions. We may not be able to explain why
we arrive at theories which make successful predictions, but we do arrive
at such theories.
Someti mes also an experience implied by a theory fails to come off;
and then, ideally, we declare the theory false. But the failure falsifies only
a block of theory as a whole, a conj unctlon of many statements. The fail­
ure shows that one or more of those statements is false, but it does not
show which. The predicted experiences, true and false, are not implied
by any one of the component statements of the theory rather than an­
other. 'rhe component statements simply do not have empirical mean­
ings, by Peirce's standard; but a sufficiently inclusive portion of theory
does. If we can aspire to a sort ot luglscher Aufbau der Welt at all, it
must be to one in which the texts slated for translation into observa­
tional a n d logico-mathematical terms are mostly broad theories taken as
wholes, rather than j ust tern" or short sentences. The translation of a
theory would be a ponderous axiomatization of all the experiential dif­
fe rence that the truth of the theory would make. It would be <1 queer
translation, for i t would translate the whole bur none of the parts. We
might better speak in such a case not of translation but si mply of obser­
vational evidence tor theories; and we mav, following Peirce, still fairly
call this the empirical meaning of the theories.
These considerations raise a philosophical q uestion even about ordi­
nary llnphilosophical translation, such as from English into A.runta or

Epistemology i':<ltural llcd

Chinese. For, if the English sentences of a theory have their meaning only
together as a body, then we can j ustify their translation into Arunu only
together as a body. There will be no j ustification for pairing off the com­
ponent English sentences with component Arunta sentences, except as
these correlations make the translation of the theory as a whole come
out right. Any translations of the English sentences into Arunta sen­
tences will be as correct as any other, so long as the net empirical impli­
cations of the theory as a whole are preserved in translation. But it is to
be expected that many different waYS of translating the component sen­
tences, essentially different individually, would deliver the same empiri­
cal implications for the theory as a whole; deviations in the translation
of one component sentence could be compensated for in the translation
of another component sentence. Insofar, there can he no ground for say­
ing which of two gla ringly unlike translations of individual sentences is
right . 1
F o r an uncritical mentalist, no s u c h indeterminacy threatens. Fvery
term and every sentence is a label attached to an idea, simple or com­
plex, which is stored in the mind. When on the other hand we take a
verification theory of meaning seriously, the indeterminacy wo uld ap­
pear to be inescapable. 'fhe Vienna Circle espoused a verification theory
of meaning but did not take it seriously enough. If we recognize with
Peirce that the meaning of a sentence turns purely on what would count
as evidence for its truth, and if we recognize with Duhem that theoretical
sentences have their evidence not as single sentences hut only as larger
blocks of theory, then the indeterminacy of translation of theoretical sen­
tences is the natural conclusion. And most sentences, apart from obser­
vation sentences, are theoretical. Tbis conclusion, conversely, once it is
embraced, seals the fate of a ny general notion of propositional meaning
or, fo r that matter, state of affairs.
Should the u nwelcomeness of the conclusion pers uade us to abandon
the verification theory of meaning ? Certainly not. The sort of meaning
that is basic to translation, and to the learning of one's own language, is
necessarily empirical meaning and nothing more. A child learns his tirst
words and sentences by hearing and using them in the presence of a ppro­
priate stimuli. These must be external stimuli, for they must act both on
the child and on the speaker from whom he is learning.4 Language is so3 , See above, pp, 2ft I Chapter 5 ) ,

cially inculcated and controlled; the i nculcation and control turn strictly
on the keying of sentences to shared stimulation. Internal factors may
vary dd libitum without prej udice to communication as long as the key­
ing of language to external stimuli is undisturbed. Surely one has no
choice but to be an empiricist s o far as one's theorv of linguistic meaning
is concerned.
Wh:1t I have said of infant learning applies equally to the l ingu ist's
learning of a new l a nguage in the fiel d . If the linguist docs not lean on re­
lated languages for which there are previously accepted translation prac­
tices, then obviously he has no data but the concomitances of native
utterance and observable stimulus s i tuation. No wonder there is indeter­
minacy of translation-for of course only a small fraction of our utter­
ances report concurrent external stimulation. Granted, the linguist will
end up with u nequivocal translations of everything; but only by making
many arbitrary choices-arbitrary even though unconscious-along the
way. Arbitrary? Bv this I mean th at different choices could still have
made everything come out right that is susceptible in principle to any
kind of check.
Let me l i n k up, In a different order, some of the points I have made.
The crucial consideration behind my argument for the indeterminacy of
translation was that a statement about the world does not always or usu­
ally have a separable fund of empirical consequences that it can call its
own. That consideration served also to account for the impossibility of
an epistemological reduction of the sort where every sentence is equated
to a sentence in observational and logico-mathematical terms. And the
impossibility of that sort of epistemological reduction dissipated the last
advantage that rational reconstruction seemed to have over psychology.
Philosophers have rightly despaired of translating everything into ob­
servational and logico-mathematical terms. They have despaired of this
even when they have not recognized, as the reason for this irred ucibi lity,
that the statements l a rgely do not have their private bundles of empirical
consequences. And some philosophers have seen i n this i rreducibility the
bankruptcy of epistemology. Carnap and the other logical positivists of
the Vienna Circle had already pressed the term " metaphysics " into pejo­
rative use, as connoting meaninglessness; and the term " epistemology"
was next. Wittgenstein and his followers, mainly at Oxford, found a re­
sidual philosophical vocation i n therapy: in curing philosophers of the
delusion that there were epistemological problems.
But I think that at this point it may be more useful to say rather that

Eplstemology :"JaturallleJ

epistemology still goes on, though i n a new setting and a clarified status.
Epistemologv, or something like it, >Imply falls into place as a chapter of
psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natur.ll phenome­
non, viz., a physical human s u b j ect. This human subject is accorded a
certain experimentally controlled input-certain patterns of irradiatioll
in assorted frequencies, for instance-and in the fullne" of time the sub­
ject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external
world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the tor­
rential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat
the same reasons that always prompted epistemology; namely, in order
to see how evidence relates to theory, dnd in what wavs one's theory of
nature transcends any available evidence.
Such a study could still include, even, something like the old rational
reconstruction, to whatever degree such reconstruction i., practica ble;
for im agmative constructions can afford hints of actu a l psychological
processes, i n much the way that mechanical SImulations ClI1 . But a con­
spicuon; difference between old epistemology and the epistemologica l
e nterprise in this new psychological setting is th,lt we can now make free
use of empirIcal psychology.
The old epistemology aspired to contain, in a sense, natural science; it
would construct it somehow from sense data. Epistemology in its new
setting, conversely, is contained in natural science, as a chapter of psy­
chology. Bur the old containment remains valid too, in its way. WE a rc
studying how the human subj ect of our study posits bodies and proj ects
his physics from his data, and we appreciate that our position in the
world is just like his. Our very epistemological enterprise, therefore, and
the psychology wherein it is a component chapter, and the whole of nat­
ur a l science wherein psychol ogy is a component book-all this is o u r
o w n construction or proj ection from stimulations l i k e those we were
meting out to our epistemologic a l subj ect. There is thm reciprocal con­
tainment, though containment in d i fferent semes: epistemology in natu­
ral science and natural science in epistem o logy.
This interplay is reminiscent again of the old threat of circularity, but
it is all right now that we have stopped dreallllng of deducmg science
from sense data. We arc after a n u n derstanding of SCIence as an institu­
tion or process i n the world, and we do not intend that understanding to
be any better than the science which is its object. This attitude is i n deed
one that Neu rath was already urging in Vienna Circle day>, with his par­
a ble of the mariner who has to re build his boat while sta y i ng afloat in it.

Q U I N T E S S E :'i C E

One effect of seeing epistemology in a psychological setting is that
it resolves a stubborn old enigma of epistemological priority. Our reti­
nas are irradiated in two dimensions, yet we see things as three-dimen­
sional without conscious inference. Which is to count as observation­
the unconscious two-dimensional reception or the conscious three­
dimensional apprehens i o n ? In the old epistemological context the con­
scious form had priority, for we were out to j ustify our knowledge of the
external world by rational reconstruction, and that demands awareness.
Awareness ceased to be demanded when we gave up trying to j ustify our
knowledge of the external world by rational reconstruction. What to
count as observation now can be settled in terms of the stimulation of
sensory receptors, let consciousness fall where it may.
The Gestalt psychologists' challenge to sensory atomism, which
seemed so relevant to epistemology forty years ago, is likewise deacti­
vated. Regardless of whether sensory atoms or Gestalten are what favor
the forefront of our consciousness, it is simply the stimulations of our
sensory receptors that are hest looked upon as the input to our cognitive
mechanism. Old paradoxes about unconscious data and inference, old
problems about chains of inference that would have to be completed too
quickly-these no longer matter.
In the old anti-psychologistic days the question of epistemological pri­
ority was moot. What is epistemologically prior to what? Are Gestalten
prior to sensory atoms because they are noticed, or should we favor sen­
sory atoms on some more subtle groun d ? Now that we are permitted to
appeal to physical stimulation, the problem dissolves; A is epistemol­
ogically prior to B if A is causally nearer than B to the sensory receptors.
Or, what is in some ways better, j ust talk explicitly in terms of causal
proximity to sensory receptors and drop the talk of epistemological pri­
ority.
Around 1 9 32 there was debate in the Vienna Circle over what to
count as observation sentences, or Protoko//satzc. ' One position was
that they had the form of reports of sense impressions. Another was that
they were statements of an elementary sort about the external world,
e.g., " A red cube is standing on the tahle . " Another, Neurath's, was that
they had the form of reports of relations between percipients and exter­
nal things: " O tto now sees a red cube on the table . " The worst of it was
that there seemed to be no obj ective way of settling the matter: no way
of making real sense of the question.

Let u ' now try to view the matter u nreservedly i n the context of the
external world. Vaguely speaking, what we want of observation sen­
tences is that they be the ones i n closest causal proximity to the sensory
receptors. But how I S such proximity to be gauge d ? The Idea may be re­
phra�ed thi� \vay: ()b�crvati()n sentencc� arc sentences which� , h w e learn
language, arc most strongly conditioned to concurrent semory sti m u b ­
t i o n rather t h a n to stored colbteul i n forma tion. T h u s l e t us IlTlagi ne "
sentence q ueried for our verdict as to whether it is true or fa lse; q ueried
for o u r assent or dissent. Then the sentence is a n observation sentence if
our verdict depends only o n the sensory stimubtion present at the time.
But a verdict cannot depen d on present stimulation to the exclUSion of
stored i n formation . The very fact of our having learned the language
evinces much storing of i n formation , and of i n formation without whicb
we should be i n no position to givce verdicts on sentences howcyer obser­
vation,,! . Evidently then we mmt relax our defi n ition of observation sen­
tence to read thus: a sentence is a n observation sentence i f a ll verdicts on
it depend o n present sensory stim u lation a n d on n o stored i n fo rmation
beyond what goes into u n de",ta ndmg the sentence.
This formulation raises a n other problem: how Me we tll distingUish
hct\v ccn in fornlC!tloll that goe� into understanding a �clltcnc(' a n d infor­
mation that goes beyon d ? cfh is is the problem 01 distingui,hing between
analvtic truth, which issues from the mere mearl lng' of word" ,md wn­
thetic truth, which depends o n more than meani ngs. Now [ have long
mainta i n ed that this distinction is illusory. There I S o n e ,tep toward such
a distincti o n , however, which does make sense: a sentence that is true by
mere meanings of words should be expected, at lea.st if it is simple, to he
su bscribed to bv all fl uent speakers i n the community. Perhap' the con­
tfoversial notion of ,lllalyticitv c a n be dispensed with, in o u r definition
of observation sentence, i n favor of this straightforward .lttri hute of
community-wide acceptance.
This attribute is of course no expltcation of an alyticity. The commu­
n ity would agree that there have been black dogs, vet none who ulk of

QUINTESSENCE

To p ut the point negatively, an observation sentence is one that is not
sensitive to differences in past experience within the speech community.
This formul ation accords perfectly with the traditional role of the ob­
servation sentence as the court of appeal of scientific theories. For by our
definition the observation sentences arc the sentences on which all mem­
bers of the commun ity will agree under uniform stimulation. And what
is the criterion of membership in the same community? Si mply general
fluency of dialogue. This criterion admits of degrees, and indeed we Ill a y
usefull y take the community more narrowly for some studies than for
others. What count as ohservation sentences for a community of special­
ists would not always so count for a larger community.
There is generally no subj ectivity in the phrasing of observation sen­
tences, as we arc now conceiving them; they will usually be a bout bod­
ies. Since the distinguishing trait of an observation sentence is intersub­
j ective agreement under agreeing stimulation, a corporeal subj ect matter
is likelier than not.
The old tendency to associate observation sentences with a subjective
sensory subject matter is rather an irony when we reflect that observa­
tion sentences are also meant to be the intersubj ective tribunal of scien­
tific hypotheses. The old tendency was due to the drive to base science on
something firmer and prior i n the subject's experience; but we dropped
that project.
The dislodging of epistemology from its old status of first philosophy
loosed a wave, we saw, of epistemological nihilism. This mood is re­
flected somewhat in the tendency of Pohinyi, Kuhn, and the late Russell
Hanson to helittle the role of evidence and to accentuate cultural relativ­
ism. I [anson ventured even to discredit the idea of observation, argu­
ing that so-called observations vary from observer to ohserver with the
amount of knowledge that the o hservers hring with them. The veteran
physicist looks at some apparatus and sees an x-ray tube. The neophyte,
looking at the same place, observes rather "a glass and metal instrument
replete with wires, reflectors, screws, lamps, and push buttons. " 6 One
man's o bservation is another man's closed book or flight of fancy. The
notion of observation as the impartial and objective source of evidence
for science is bankrupt. Now my answer to the x-ray example was al­
ready hinted a little while back: what counts as an observation sentence

Q U ( l': T E S S E N C E

It is no shock to the preconceptions of old Vienna to say that episte­
mology now becomes semantics. For epistemology remains centered as
always on evidence, and meaning remains centered as always on verifica­
tion; and evidence is verification. What is likelier to shock preconcep­
tions i s that meaning, once we get heyond observation sentences, ceases
in general to have any clear applicability to single sentences; also that
epistemology merges with psychology, as well as with linguistics.
'fhis rubbing out of houndaries could contribute to progress, it seems
to me, in philosophically interesting inquiries of a scientific nature. One
poss i ble area is perceptual norms. Consider, to begin with, the linguis­
tic phenomenon of phonemes. We form the hahit, in hearing the myr­
iad variations of spoken sounds, of treating each as an approximation
to one or another of a limited number of norms-around thirty alto­
gether--constituting so to speak a spoken alphabet. All speech in our
language can be treated in practice as sequences of j ust those thirty ele­
ments, thus rectifying small deviations. Now outside the realm of lan­
guage also there i s probably only a rather limited alphabet of perceptual
norms altogether, toward which we tend unconsciously to rectify all per­
ceptions. These, if experimentally identified, could be taken as episte­
mological building blocks, the working elements o f experience. They
might prove i n part to be culturally variable, as phonemes are, and in
part universal.
Again there is the area that the psychologist Donald T. Camp hell
calls evolutionary epistemology." In this area there is work by l liiseyin
Yilmaz, who shows how some structural traits of color perception could
h ave been predicted from survival value. I I) And a more emphatically
epistemological topic that evolution helps to clarify is induction, now
that we are allowing epistemology the resources of natural science. I I

Names of philosophical positions a r e a necessary evil. They a r e neces­
sary because we need to refer to a stated position or doctrine from time
to time, and it would be tiresome to keep restating it. They are evil in
that they come to be conceived as designating schools of thought, o bj ects
of loyalty from within and obj ects of o bloquy from without, and hence
obstacles, within and without, to the pursuit of truth.
[n identifying the philosophical position that [ call naturalism, then, r
shall j ust be describing my own position, without prej udice to possibly
divergent uses of the term. In Theories and Things I wrote that natural­
ism is " the recognition that it is within science itself, and not in some
prior philosophy, that reality is to be identified and described " ; again
that it is " abandonment of the goal of a first philosophy prior to natural
science" (pp. 2 1 , 6 7 ) . These characterizations convey the right mood,
but they would fare poorly in a debate. How much qualifies as " science
itself" and not " some prior philosophy " ?
I n science itself I certainly want to include the farthest flights o f phys­
ics and cosmology, as well as experimental psychology, history, and the
social sciences. Also mathematics, insofar at least as it is applied, for it is
indispensable to natural science. What then am r excluding as " some
prior philosophy, " and why ? Descartes' dualism between mind and
body is called metaphysics, but it could as well be reckoned as science,
however false. He even had a causal theory of the interaction of mind
and body through the pineal gland. If I saw indirect explanatory benefit
in positing sensibilia, possibilia, spirits, a Creator, I would j oyfully ac­
cord them scientific status too, on a par with such avowedly scientific
posits as qua rks and black holes. What then have r banned under the
name of prior philosophy ?
275

276

Q U I N T E S S E i': C E

Dcmarcation is not my purpose. My point in the characterizations
of naturalism that I quoted is j ust that the most we can reasonably seek
in support of an invcntory and description of reality is tcstability of
its observable consequences in the timc-honored hypothctico-dcductivc
way-whereof more anon. Naturalism need not cast aspersions on irre­
sponsiblc metaphysics, however deserved, much less on soft sciences or
on the speculative reaches of the hard ones, except insofar as a firmer ba­
sis is claimed for thcm than the experimental method itself.
Whcre naturalistic renunciation shows itself most clearly and signifi­
cantly is in naturalistic cpistemology. Various epistemologists, from Des­
ca rtes to Carnap, had sought a foundation for natural scicnce in mental
entities, the flux of raw sense data. It was as if we might first fashion a
self-sufficient and infallible lore of sense data, innocent of reference to
physical things, and then build our theory of the external world some­
how on that finishcd foundation. The naturalistic epistemologist dis­
misses this dream of prior sense-datum language, arguing that thc posit­
ing of physical things is itself our indispensable tool for organizing and
remembering what is otherwise, in .lames' words, a " blooming, buzzing
confusion. , .
To account for knowledge of an external thing or event, accordingly,
the naturalistic epistemologist looks rather to the external thing or event
itself and the causal chain of stimulation from it to one's brain. In a para­
digm casc, light rays are rcflected from the obj ect to one's retina, activat­
ing a patch of nerve endings, each of which initiates a neural impulse to
one or another centcr of the brain. Through intricate processes within
the brain, finally, and abetted by imitation of other people or by instruc­
tion, a child comes in time to utter or assent to some rudimentary sen­
tence at the end of such a causal chain. I call it an observation sentence.
Examples arc " Jr's cold, " " It's raining, " " ( That'S ) milk, " " (That's a )
dog. "
Customarily the expcrimental psychologist chooses one or a nother
object or event, from somewhere along such a causal chain, to represent
the chain, and this he calls the stimulus. Usually it is an evcnt of his own
devising. In one experiment it will be a flash or a buzz in the subj ect's vi­
cinity, and in another it will be an ice cube or a shock at the subj ect'S sur­
face. for our more general purposcs, not linked to any particular experi­
ment, an economical strategy in defining the stimulus is to intercept the
causal chains j ust at the subj ect's surface. Nothing is lost, for it is only
from that point inward that the chains contrihutc to the suhject's knowl­
edgc of the external world.

N,}turalism;

Of,

LIVlIlg withlll One's tvlcdn<.,

Indeed, even what reache, the subject's surface is relevant only if it
triggers neural receptors. So we might for o ur purposes simply identify
the subj ect's stimulus, over a given brief moment, with the temporally
ordered set of sensory receptors triggered in that moment.
Still further economy might be sought by intercepting the causal
chains rather at ,1 deeper level-somewhere within the brain; for even
the surface receptors that are trigge red on any given occasion are largely
without relevant effect on the subj ect's behavior. However, our knowl­
edge of these deeper levels is still too sketchy. Moreover, as research in­
creasingly penetrates these depths, we become aware of complexity and
heterogeneity radically at variance with the neat simplicity at the sur­
face. Fach receptor, after all, admits of just two clean-cut states: trig­
gered or not.
Moreoyer, the behaviorally irrelevant triggerings in a gl obal stimulus
can be defined out anyway, in due course, by appeal to perceptu al simi­
laritv of stim u l i . The receptors whose firing is salient in a given stimulus
are the ones that it shares with all perceptua lly similar stimuli. Percep­
tual simi larity itself can be measured, for a given individual, by rein­
forcement and extinction of responses.
So it seems best for present purposes to construe the subject's stimulus
on a given occasion simply as his global neural intake on that occasion.
But I shall refer to it only as neural intake, not stimulus, for other no­
tions o f stim u l u s are wanted in other studies, particularly where differ­
ent subj ects arc to get the same sti mulus. Neural intake is private, for
subj ects do not share receptors.
Perceptual similarity, then, is a relation between a suhj ect's neural in­
takes. Though testable, it is a private affair; the intakes arc hiS, and arc
perceptu ally more or less similar for him. Perceptual similarity is the ba­
sis of all learning, all habit formation, all expectation bv induction from
past experience; for we are innately disposed to expect similar events to
have sequels that are similar to each other.
The association of observation sentences with neural intakes is many­
many. Any one of a range of perceptually fairly similar intakes may
prompt the subject's assent to any one o f a range of semantically k indred
sentences . But in contrast to the privacv of neural intakes, and the pri­
vacy of their perceptual similarity, o bservation sentences and their se­
mantics are a public matter, since the child has to learn these from her ei­
ders. Her learning then depends indeed both on the public currency of
the observation sentences and on a preestablished harmony of people's
private scales of perceptual similarity. The harmony is formal, in this

277

278

QUINTESSENCE

sense: if a witness finds the first of three scenes less similar to the second
than to the third, another witness is apt to do likewise. This approximate
harmony is preestablished in a shared gene pool. Different people's feel­
ings still might not match, whatever that might mean.
This much is a naturalistic analogue or counterpart of the traditional
epistemologist's phenomenalistic foundation in sense data. I [owever, it
pretends to plausihility in psychology, in genetics, and even in prehistory.
O bservation sentences have their antecedents in birdcalls and in the sig­
nal cries of the apes.
Building on this naturalistic fo undation, then, in parallel to the old
epistemologist's proposed construction of science on a foundation of
sense data, the naturalist would venture a psychologica lly and histori­
cally plausible sketch of the individ ual's acquisition of science and per­
haps the evolution of science down the ages, with an eye primarily to
the logic of evidence. r will spare you most of that, for I have gone into it
in Word and Objcct and better in The Roots 0/ Re/erence, Pursuit 0/
Tru th, and elsewhere. There are j ust a couple of aspects that r want to re­
mind you of.
One is reification, or the positing of objects. O bservation sentences
commonly contain words that refer to obj ects when used in mature dis­
course, but the infant first acquires such a sentence only as a seamless
whole, conditioned-li ke the signal cry of the ape-to an appropriate
range of global neural intakes. But there is a harbinger of reification al­
ready in our innate propensity, and that of other animals, to confer sa­
lience on those components of a neural intake that transmit corporeal
patches of the visual field. It is what Donald Campbell calls our i nnate
reification of bodies, hut I construe reification rather in degrees . Special
ways of compounding observation sentences mark further steps in the
reification of bodies, and the job is complete only when the speaker has
mastered past and future tense and knows abour the unseen but continu­
ous translation of an identical body through space between observa­
tions. It is only then that she makes sense of a body's being the same
body from one observation to another despite intervening changes in ap­
pearance.
At that point the reification of bodies is fuli lledged. Reification of less
conspicuous obj ects, notably abstract ones such as numbers and ciasses,
takes further explaining, and admits of it. A crucial step there, as I see it,
is mastery of relative clauses and pronouns.
This burgeoning language of science is a direct extension of the falter-

�<lrura i I sl11 ; orl I . I V l Il g w l t h m

O n e \ \'fe a n ...,

ing language of observation. Segments of obse[\'anon sentences carry
over and become�some of them�terms for obj ects . Conversely, sen­
tences learned only later by grammatical synthesis from a sophisticated
voca bulary can corne to qualifv as observation sentences ." well. For,
what I take as definitive of observation sentences is j mt th" pa i r of con­
ditions: first, the speaker must he disposed to assent to the sentence or
dissent from it outright on mak ing the appropriate obstTvation, i rrespec­
tive of his interrupted line of thought if any, and second, the verdict must
command the agreement of any witnesses from the appropriate lan­
guage community. This second requirement, intersuhj ectivity, I S needed
in order that the child be able to learn observation sentences from his el­
ders; and those sentences, some of them, are his indispensable entering
wedge in acquiring cognitive langu,lgc. lntersuhj ectivity of observation
sentences is likewise essential at the other end, to assure obj ectivitv of
selenet'.
The sharing of voca bulary by obsen'atl on sentences and sentences of
science was necessary not only for the emergence o f scientIfic language;
it is necessary also as a channel for the e m p i rical testing of scientific hy­
potheses . The primordial hypotheses are what j ca ll observation cate­
goricals, compounded of pairs of o bservatIon sentence" thn, "When it
snows, it's cold . " 'Tt) check such a hypothesis experimentally, we contrive
to put ourselves in ;1 situation where the first component, " It's snowing, "
is observa bly fulfilled, and then we check for fulfil lment of the second
component. If it is fulfilled, the categorical remains standing until fu rther
notice. If it is not fulfilled, the categorical is refuted once for n i l .
I s e e t b i s a s t b e k e y to t h e empirical testing also of more sophisticated
hypotheses . We conjoin the hypothesis in qu estion to a ,ct of already
previously accepted statements, sufficient together to imply some o hser­
vation categorical that was not implied by tbe previo u s set alone. Then
we check the observation categorical.
The appeal to logical implication here pre,ents no problem. The basic
laws of logic arc internalized in learning the use of the logical particles.
For instance, the child learns by observation and parental correction that
it is misuse of the conj u nction " a n d " to a ffirm an " a n d " compound and
then deny one of the components. The child has thus intern.llized one
simple logical implication, namely that ,111 " an d " compound implies its
components, on pain of simply getting a word wrong. Correspondingly
for other basic implications, up to and including the laws of quantifiers
and identity. Insofar I am with Lauener in recognizing a n " l yticitv.

Q U I N T U S E l': C: E

Scientists of course do not trace all these links of implication from
hypothesis to observation categorical. It would mean filling in all the
logically requisite supporting statements, most of which arc so famil­
iar to him or so trivial as to go without saying. In practice, moreover,
many tacit premisses often express mere statistical trends or probabili­
ties, which he will take in stride unless unexpected results prompt him to
reconsider.
Still the deduction and checking of observation Cltegoricals is the es­
sence, surely, of the experimental method, the hypothetico-deductive
method, the method, in Popper's words, of conj ecture and refutation. It
brings out that prediction of observable events is the ultimate test of sci­
entific theory.
I speak of test, not purpose. 'fhe purpose of science is to be sought
rather in intellectual curiosity and technology. In our prehistoric begin­
nings, however, the purpose of the first glimmerings of scientific theory
w a s presumably prediction, insofar as purpose can he despiritualized
into natural selection and survival value. This takes m hack to our IIl­
nate sense or standard of perceptual similarity, and the innate expecta­
tion that similars will have mutually similar sequels. In short, primitive
induction.
Prediction is verbalized expectation. Conditional expectation, when
correct, has survival value. Natural selection has accordingly favored in­
nate standards of perceptual similarity that have harmonized with trends
in our environment. Natural science, finally, is conditional expectation
hypertrophied.
I said that prediction is not the main purpose of science, hut o nly the
test. It is a negative test at that, a test by refutation. As a further dis­
avowal let me add, contrarY to positivism, that a sentence docs not even
need to he testable in order to qualify as a respectable sentence of sci­
ence. A sentence is testable, in my liberal or holistic sense, i f add ing it to
previously accepted sentences clinches an observation categorical that
was not implied by those previous sentences alone; but much good sci­
ence is untestable even in this liberal sense. We helieve many things he­
cause they fit in smoothly by analogy, or they symmetrize and simpl ify
the overall design . Surely much history and social science is of this sort,
and some hard science. Moreover, such acceptations a re not idle fancy;
their proliferation generates, every here and there, a hypothesis that can
indeed he tested. Surely this is the major source of testable hypotheses
and the growth of science.

The natm alization of epistemology, a s J have heen sketching it, is both
a l imitation and a liberation. The old quest for a fou ndation for natural
science, firmer than science itself, is abandoned: that much is the limita­
tion. 'rhe liberation is free access to the resources of natural science,
without fear of circularity. The naturalistic epistemologist settles for
what he can learn a bout the strategy, logic, and mechanics by which our
ela horate theory of the physical world is i n fact proj ected, or might be,
or should be, from j ust that amorphous neural intake.
Is this sort of thing still philosophy ? Naturalism brings a salutary blur­
ring of such boundaries. Naturalistic philosophy is continuous with nat­
ural science. It undertakes to clarify, organize, and simplify the broadest
and most hasic concepts, and to analyze scientific method and evidence
within the framework of science itself. The boundary between naturalis­
tic philosophv and the rest of science is j ust a vague matter of degree.
;\Jaturalism is naturally associated with physicalism, or materialIsm.
I do not equate them, as witness my earlier remark o n Cartesian dual­
ism. I do embrace physicalism as a scientific position, but I could be dis­
suaded of it on future scientific grounds without being dissuaded of
naturalism. Quantum mechanics today, indeed, in its neoclassical or Co­
pen hagen interpretation, has a distinctly mentalistic ring.
My naturalism has evidently been boiling down to the claim that
in o u r pursuit of truth a bout the world we cannot do better than our tra­
ditional scientific procedure, the hypothetlco-deductive method. A re­
buttal suggests itself here: surely mathematicians. The o bvious defense
against that rebuttal is to say that mathematical truths are not about the
world. But this is not a defense of my choosing. I n my view applied
mathematics is about the world.
Thus consider again a case where we are testing a scientific hypothesis
by conjoining it to some already accepted statements and deducing an
observation categorical. Likely as not, some of those already accepted
statements are p urely mathematica l. This is how pure mathematics gets
applied. Whatever empirical content those already accepted statements
can claim, then, from being needed i n implying the observation categori­
cal, is imbibed in particular by the mathematical ones.
'rhus it is that I am inclined to blur the boundary between mathemat­
ics and natural science, no less than the boundary between philosophy
and natural science. If it is protested that proved mathematical truths
are not subJ ect to subsequent refutation, my answer is that we safe­
guard them bv choosing to revoke non-mathematical statements instead,

281

2H2

QUINTESSENCE

in Cdses where a set of statements has been found conj ointlv to imply a
false observation categorical. Reasons can be adduced for doing so; but
enough.
That leaves open the vast proliferations of mathematics that there is
no thought or prospect of applying. I sec these domains as integral to our
overall theory of reality only on sufferance: they are expressed in the
same syntax and lexicon as applicable mathematics, and to exclude them
as meaningless by a d hoc gerrymandering of our syntax would be thank­
less at best. So It " left to u s to try to a"ess these sentences also as true or
false, i f we care to . Manv arc settled by the same laws that settle applica­
ble m a thematics. For the rest, r would settle them as far as practicable by
considerations of economy, on a par with the decisions we make in natu­
ral science when trving to frame empirical hypotheses worthy of experi­
mental testing.
·rraditional epistemologv was in part normative in intent. Naturalis­
tic epistemology, in contrast, is viewed by Henri Lauener and others
as purely descriptive. I disagree. Just as traditional epistemology on its
speculative side gets naturalized into science, or next of kin, so on its
normative side it gets naturalized into technology, the technology of
scicntizing.
What might he offered first of all as a norm of naturalized epistemol­
ogy is predictIOn of ohseruatlCJ11 as a lest of a hypothesis. [ think of this
as more than a norm: as the name of the game. Science cannot all be
tested, and the softer the science the sparser the tests; but when it is
tested, the test is prediction of observation. Moreover, naturalism has no
special claims on the principle, which is rather the crux of empiricism.
What are more distinctively naturalistic and technological are norms
based on scientific findings. ·rhus science has pretty well established­
subj ect to future disestablishment, a s always-that our information
about distant events and other people reaches us only through impact
of rays and particles on our sensory receptors. A normative corollary is
that we should be wary of astrologers, palmists, and other soothsayers.
Think twice about E . s . P.
For a richer a rrav o f norms, vague in various degrees, we may look to
the heuristics of hypothesis: how to think up a hypothesis worth testing.
Th is is where considerations of conservatism and s implicity come in,
and, at a more technical levcl, probabi lity theory and statistics. [n prac­
tice those technical matters spill over also, as [ remarked, to complicate
the hypothetico-ded uctive method itself.

I said at the beginning of this paper that according to naturalism is it
within science itself and not some prior philosophy that reality is to be
identified. Farther along in a more narrowly scientific spirit, r speculated
on how we round our our recognition of obj ects as objects, bit by bit,
with our acquisition of language and science . These matters call now for
some more broadly philosophical reflections.
Let us recall, to begin with, that the association of observation sen­
tences with neural intake is holophrastic. What obj ects the component
words may designate in other contexts is irrelevant to the association.
This is obviously so if the observation sentence is to be acquired as a first
step in language learning; but the association is equally direct and holo­
phrastic in its operation even if the sentence was acquired through syn­
thesis of its words, and gained its immediacy only through subsequent
famili arization.
Moreover, the specifics of designation and denotation arc not only in­
different to the association of o bservation sentences to neural intake;
thev arc ind ifferent also to the implication of observation categoricals by
scientific theory. It is logical implication; and logic, unlike set theory and
the rest of mathematics, responds to no traits of objects beyond same­
ness and difference . So we must conclude that obj ects of any sort figure
only as neurral nodes in the structure of scientific theory, so far as empir­
ical evidence is concerned. We can arbitrarily change the values of our
variables, the designata of our names, and the denotata of our predicates
without disturbing the evidence, so long anyway as the new obj ects arc
explicitly correlated one to one with the old. Such is the indeterminacy
of reference, as I have come to call it.
At first it i s perhaps alarming. We are left with no basis, it would seem,
for j udging whether we arc talking about familiar things or some arbi­
trary proxies. The shock subsides, however, when we reflect on a homely
example or two . Thus think of a body in the scientific framework of
space and time. Insofar as you specify the precise sinuous filament of
four-dimensional space-time that the hody takes up in the course of its
career, you have fixed the ohject uniquely. We could go farther and iden­
tl/V the object, a chipmunk perhaps, with its portion of space-time, thus
saying that it is tiny at its early end and higger at its late end. The move is
artificial, but actually it confers a hit of economy, if we are going to have
the s pace-time a nyway. Subj ective connotations of brownness, softness,
swift and erratic movement, and the rest simply carry over. Surely all
matters of evidence remain undisturbed. We arc even prepared to say

283

284

QUINTESSENCE

that it was what a body was all along, an appropriately filled-in portion
of space-time as over against empty ones.
Next we might identify space-time regions in turn with the sets of qua­
druples of numbers that determine them in some arbitrarily adopted
frame of coordinates. We can transfer sensory connotations now to this
abstract mathematical object, and still there is no violence to scientific
evidence. To speak intuitively, nothing really happened.
Thus we can come to terms somewhat with the indeterminacy of refer­
ence, as applied to bodies and other sensible substances, by j ust letting
the sensory connotations of the observation sentences carry over from
the old obj ects to their proxies.
In the case of a bstract obj ects such as numbers, devoid of sensory
connotations, the indeterminacy of reference is already familiar. It is
seen in Frege's so-called Caesar problem: the number five may be Jul­
ius Caesar. We happily use numbers without caring whether they he
taken according to the Frege-Russell constructions or Ackermann's or
von Neumann's. The point was dramatized long ago by E P. Ramsey with
his expedient of Ramsey sentences, as they have come to be called. In­
stead of invoking the a bstract objects specifically, when certain of their
properties arc needed in an argument, the Ramsey sentence j ust says that
there are obj ects with the properties, and then invokes the objects by
varia bles without further identification. This expedient only works for
a bstract objects, however, used as auxiliaries here and there without re­
gard to whether they remain the same obj ects from one context to an­
other.
The indeterminacy of reference can he seen again in its full general­
ity, as Davidson once remarked, by a n examination of Tarski's classical
truth definition. If a sentence comes out true under that definition, it
continues to do so when obj ects are reassigned to its predicates in any
one-to-one way.
These reflections on ontology are a salutary reminder that the ultimate
data of science are limited to our neural intake, and that the very notion
of object, concrete or abstract, is of our own making, along with the rest
of natural science and mathematics. It is our overwhelmingly ingenious
apparatus for systematizing, predicting, and partially controlling our in­
take, and we may take pride.
This conventionalist view of ontology appeals, I expect, to Henri
Lauener. He in his pragmatism even settles for a plurality of scientific
specialties, each with its working ontology, and no dream of an over­
arching, unifying fact of the matter.

Naturalism itself is noncommittal on this q uestion of unity of science.
Naturalism j ust sees it as a question within science itself, alheit a ques­
tion more remote from o hservational checkpoints than the most specula­
tive questions of the hard and soft sciences ordinarily so called.
Naturalism can still respect the drive, on the part o f some of us, for a
unified, all-purpose o ntology. The drive is typical of the scientific tempe r,
and of a piece with the drive for simplicity that shapes scientific hvpothe­
ses general ly. Physicalism is its familiar manifestatio n , and phYSicalism IS
bound to have had important side e ffects in the framing of more special
hypotheses m variou s branches of science; for phvsicalism puts a pre­
mium on hypotheses favorable to closer i ntegration with physics itself.
We have here a conspicuou s case of what I touched on earlier: scientific
hypotheses which, though not themselves testable, help to elicit others
that arc.
In any event, we are now seeing ontology as more utterly d h uman op­
tion than we used to. We are drawn to Lauener's pragmatism. Must we
then conclude that true reality is beyond our ken? No, that would be to
forsake naturalism. Rather, the notion of reality is itself part of the appa­
ratus; and sticks, srones, atoms, quarks, numbers, and classes all arc ut­
terly real denizens of an ultimate real world, except insofar ," our pres­
ent science may prove false on further testing.
What then is naturalism's line on truth a n d fa l s itv themselves ? The
truth predicate raises no problem in its normal d a i ly use as an instru­
ment of what I have called semantic ascent. Tarski's disquotational ac­
count accommodates it, so long as what are Cllled true are sentences i n
o u r own language; a n d w e then extend the predicate to sentences of
other languages that we accept as translations of truths of our own.
However, paradoxes arise when the truth predicate is applied to sen­
tences that contain that very predicate or related ones; so we are called
upon to recognize rather a hierarchy of truth predicates, each of which
behaves properlv only in application to sentences that do not contain
that predicate itself or higher ones. It is a hierarchy of better and better
truth predicates but no best. In practice, except in contexts such as these
philosophical ones, occasions seldom arise for venturing a bove the first
rung of the ladder. Truth off the hierarchy, a bsolute truth, would i n deed
be transcendent; bringing it down into scientific theory of the world en­
genders paradox. So naturalism has no place for that.
Still, our concept of truth strains at its naturalistic moorings in an­
other way. We naturalists say that science is the highest path ro truth, but
still we do not say that everything on which scientists agree is true. Nor

285

286

QUINTESSENCE

do we say that something that was true became false when scientists
changed their minds. What we say is that they and we thought it was
true, but it wasn't. We have scientists pursuing truth, not decreeing it.
Truth thus stands forth as an ideal of pure reason, in Kant's apt phrase,
and transcendent indeed. On this score I am again with Lauener.
C.S. Peirce tried to naturalize truth by identifying it with the limit that
scientific progress approaches. This depends on optimistic assumptions,
but if we reconstrue it as mere metaphor it does epitomize the scientists'
persistent give and take of conjecture and refutation. Truth as goal re­
mains the established usage of the term, and I acquiesce in it as j ust a
vivid metaphor for our continued adj ustment of our world picture to our
neural intake. Metaphor is perhaps a handy category in which to accom­
modate transcendental concepts from a naturalist point of view.

Doubt h a s oft been said t o b e the mother of philosophy. This h a s a true
ring for those of us who look upon philosophy primarily as the theory of
knowledge. For the theory of knowledge has its origin in doubt, in scep­
ticism. Doubt is what prompts us to try to develop a theory of knowl­
edge. Furthermore, douht is also the first step to take in developing a the­
ory of knowledge, if we adopt the line of Descartes.
But this is only half of a curious interplay between doubt and knowl­
edge. Doubt prompts the theory of knowledge, yes; but knowledge, also,
was what prompted the doubt. Scepticism is an offshoot of science . The
basis for scepticism is the awareness of illusion, the discovery that we
must not always believe our eyes. Scepticism battens on mirages, on
seemingly hent sticks in water, on rainhows, a fter-images, double im­
ages, dreams. But in what sense are these illusions ? In the sense that they
seem to be material obj ects which they in fact are not. Illusions arc illu­
sions only relative to a prior acceptance of genuine hodies with which to
contrast them. In a world of immediate sense data with no bodies pos­
ited and no questions asked, a distinction between reality and illusion
would have no place. The positing of bodies is a lready rudimentary
physical science; and it is only a fter that stage that the sceptic's invidious
distinctions can make sense. Bodies have to be posited before there can
be a motive, however tenuous, for acquiescing in a non-committal world
of the immediate given.
Rudimentary physical science, that is, common sense about hodies, is
ThiS paper lS meant as a summary statement of my a ttitude towards our knowl­
edge of nature. Con'iequently [ must \varn the more omnivorous of my readers ( dear

t h u s needed a s a s p n ngboard f o r scepticism. It contri butes t h e needed
notion o f a cilstlllction between reality and illusion, and that is not all. It
a l so discerns regu l a rities of bodilv behaviour which are indi spensable to
that dlstll1ct l o n . The sceptlc\ examp l e of the seeminglv bent stick owes
Its f<'fce to our k nowledge that sticks do not bend by immersion; and h i s
examples oi ml r,lgcs, a fter- I mages, dreams, and the rest are similarly
parasitic upon positive science, however primitive.
1 ,1 m not ,lCcuSlng the sceptic of beggIng the question. He i s quite
within h I S nghts I II asmmlng science 111 order to refute science; th is, if
cMned out, would be ,1 straIghtforward argument by reductio ad ,lhsur­
dllm. I ,1m only making the point that sceptical doubts are scientific
dou bts.
EpistemologIsts have coped with their sceptical doubts by trying to re­
construct our k nowledge of the external world from sensations. A char­
acteristic effort was Berkeley's theorv of vision, in which he sought our
clues for a tIlI rd d i menSIon, depth, in our two-dimensional visual field.
'rhe verv po>Ing of tlm epi stemological problem depends i n a striking
way upon ,lcccptatlons of physical science. The goal of the construction,
namely the depth dlme"'lo", i s of course deliberately taken from the sci­
ence of the e"tern,d world; but what particularly wants noticing is that
also the accepted bas" of the construction, the two-dimensional visual
field, was Itself dICtated by the science of the external world as well. The
light that i n forms u s of the external world impinges on the two-dimen­
sional s u rbcr o f t h e e y e , and it w a s Berkeley's awareness of t h i s t h a t set
his problem.
Epistemology " best looked upon, then, as an enterprise within natu­
ral science. CarteSIan doubt IS not the way to begin. Retaining our pres­
e nt beliefs a bout nature, we can still ask how we can have arrived at
them. Science tells lI S that o u r only source of information a bout the ex­
ternal world i s through the impact of light rays and molecules upon our
sensory surfaces. Stimulated i n these ways, we somehow evolve an elah­
orate and usctul science. How do we do this, and why does the resulting
science work so wel l ' These a r e genuine questions, and no feigning of
doubt i s needed to a pplTci ate them. They are scientific questions a bout a
specics of primates, a n d they are open to investigation in natural science,
the very sCIence whose acquisition is being investigated .
The utility of SCIence, from a practical point of view, lies in fulfilled ex­
pectation: truc prechctlon. This is true not only of sophisticated science,
but o f its ptllnitlve progenitor as well; and it may be good strategy o n

The Nature of l'.:atural Knowledge

our parr to think first of thc most primitivc case. This case i s simple in­
duction . It i s the expectation, when some past eV'ent recurs, that the se­
quel of that past evcnt will recur too. People a re prone to this, and so are
othcr animals.
Ir may he felt that I am undulv intellectualizing the dumh animals in
attributing expectation and induction to them. Sti l l t h e n e t resultant be­
haviour of dumb animals is much on a par with our own, at thc level of
simple induction. In a dog's expcrience, a c latter o f pam i n the kitchen
has been fol lowcd by something to eat. So now, hearing the clatter again,
he goes to the kitchen in expectation o f dinncr. His going to the kitchen
is our evidence of his expectation, if we cuc to speak of expectatio n .
Or we can skip t h i s interveni ng v<lriable, as S k i n n e r calls it, and speak
merely of reinforced response, conditioned reflex, habit formation.
When we talk easily o f repetition of events, rcpetition o f stimuli, we
cover over a certai n significant factor. It is the sim ilarity factor. It can be
brought into the open by spcaking of events rathcr as unique, dated,
un repeated parriculars, and thcn speaking of similarities between them.
Each of the noisy episodes of the pans is a distinct cvent, however simi­
lar, and so is each o f the ensuing d inners. What we can say of the dog in
those terms is that he hears something similar to the old cbtter and pro­
cceds to expect something similar to the old dinner. O r, i f we want to
eliminate the intcrvening variable, we can stil l say this: whcn thc dog
hears something similar to the old clatter and, going to the kitchen, gets
something s i milar to the old dinner, he is reinforced in his disposition to
go to thc kitchcn after each fu rther event similar to the old clatter.
What IS significant a bout this simIlarity factor is its subjectivity. h sim­
i larity the mere sharing of many attributes ? But any two things share
countlcss attri butes�or anyway any two obj ects share membership in
countless c1asscs. 'rhe similarity that marrers, i n the cl atter of the pans, is
similarity for the dog. Again I scem to appeal to the dog's ment a l lifc, but
again I can eliminate this intervcning variable. We can analyse similarity,
for the dog, in tcrms of his dispositions to behaviour: his pattcrns of
hahit formation. I lis hahit of going to the kitchen after a clatter of pans
is itself o u r basis for saying that the clatter cvents a re similar for the dog,
and that the dinner events are similar for the dog. It is by experimental
reinforcement and extinction along these l i nes that we can assess similar­
ities for thc dog, detcrmining whether event a is more Sim i l a r to h tha n to
c for him. Mcanwhilc his mcnul 1 1 fe is as may bc.
Now our question 'Why i s science so successfu l ? ' makes some rudi-

289

290

QUJNTES�ENCL

mentary sense already at til l S level, as applied to the dog. l'or the dog's
habit formation, his primitive induction, involved extra polation along
similarity lines: episodes similM to the old clattering episode engendered
expectation of episodes similar to the old dinner episode. And now the
crux of the problem is the su bj ectivity of similarity. Why should nature,
however lawful, match up at all with the dog's subj ective similarity rat­
i ngs ? Here, at its most primitive, is the question 'Whv is science so suc­
cessfu l ? '
W e a r e taking this as a scientific q uestion, remember, o p e n t o investi­
gation by natural science itself. Why should the dog's implicit similarity
ratings tend to fit world trends, in sllch a way as to favour the dog's im­
plicit expectati ons ? An answer is o ffered by Darwin's theory of natural
selection. Individuals whose similarity groupings conduce largely to true
expectations have a good chance of fin ding food and avoiding predators,
and so a good chance of living to reproduce their kind.
What I have said of the dog holds equally o f us, at least in our p llrsuit
of the rudimentary science of common sense. We predict in the light of
observed uniformities, and these are unifo rmities by our subj ective simi­
Luity standards. These standards a re innate ones, overlaid and modified
by experience; and natllral selection has endowed us, like the dog, with a
head start in the way of helpful, innate similaritv standards.
I am not appealing to Darwinian biology to j u stify induction. This
would be circular, since biological k nowledge depends on induction.
Rather I am granting the efficacy o f inductio n , and then o bserving that
Darwinian biology, if true, helps explain why induction is as efficacious
as it is.
We must notice, still , a further limitation. Natural selection may be
expected onlv to have encouraged similarity standards conducive to
rough and ready anticipations of experience in a state of nature. Such
standards are not necessarily conducive to deep science . Colour is a case
in point. Colour dominates our scene; similarity in colour is similarity at
its most conspicuous. Yet, as J . .J. c . Smart points out, colour plays little
role in natural science. Things can be alike in colour even tbough one of
them is reflecting green light of uniform wave length while the other is
reflecting mixed waves of yel l ow and blue. Properties that arc most ger­
mane to sophISticated science are camouflaged bv colour more than re­
vealed by it. Over-sensitivity to colour mav have been all to the good
when we were bent on quickly distinguishing predator from prey or
good plants from bad. But true science cuts through all this and sorts
things out differently, leaving colour largely irrelevant.

The Nature of :"Jatur"l Know ledge

Colour is not the only such case. Taxonomv is rich i n examples to
show that visual resem blance is a poor index of kinship. N atural selec­
tion has even abetted the deception; thus some owls have grown to re­
semhle cats, for their own good, and others resemble monkevs. Natural
selection works both to improve a creature's similarity standards and to
help him abuse his enemies' similarity standards.
For a l l their fallibility, our innate similarity standards arc i ndispens­
able to science as an entering wedge. They continue to he indispensable,
moreover, even as science advances. For the adva nce of science depends
on continued observation, continued checking of predictions. And there,
at the observational level, the unsophisticated similarity standards of
common sense remain i n force.
An individual's innate similarity standards undergo mme revision, of
course, even at the common-sense level, indeed even at the subhuman
level, through learning. An animal may learn to tel l a cat from an owl.
The a b i l ity to learn is itself a product of natural selection, WIth evident
survival value. An animal's innate similarity standards are a rudimentary
instrument for prediction, and then learning is a progressive refinement
of that instrument, making for more dependable prediction. I n man, and
most conspicuously in recent centuries, this refinement has consisted in
the development of a vast and bewildering growth of conceptual or lin­
guistic apparatus, the whole o f natural science. Biologica l l y, still, it is like
the animal's learning a bout cats and owls; it is a learned improvement
over simple i nduction by i nnate similarity standards. It makes for more
and better prediction.
Science revises our similarity standards, we sa\\'; thus we discount col­
our, for some purposes, and we liken whales to cows rather than to fish.
But this is not the sole or principal way in which science fosters predic­
tion. Mere improvement of similarity standards would increase our suc­
cess at simple induction, but this is the least of it. Science departs from
simple induction. Science is a ponderous l inguistic structure, fa bricated
of theoretical terms linked by fa bricated hypotheses, and keyed to ob­
servable events here and there. Indirectly, via this la byrinthine super­
structure, the scientist predicts future observations on the basis of past
ones; and he may revise the superstructure when the predictions fai l . It is
no longer simple induction. It is the hypothctico-deducti\T method. But,
like the animal's simple induction over innate similarities, it is still a bio­
logical device for anticipating experience. It owes m elements still to nat­
ural selection-notably, the similarity standards that cont i nue to operate
at the observational level. The biological survival value of the resulting

29 1

292

QUINTESSENCE

scientific structure, however, is as may be. 'fraits that were developed by
natural selection have been known to prove lethal, through overdevel­
o pment or remote effects or changing environment. In any event, and for
whatever good it may do us, the hypothetico-deductive method is deliv­
ering knowledge hand over fist. It is facilitating pred iction.
I said that science is a linguistic structure that is keyed to observation
at some points. Some sentences are keyed directly to o bservation: the ob­
servation sentences. Let us examine this connection . First I must explain
what I mean by an observation sentence. One distinctive trait of such a
sentence is that its truth value varies with the circumstances prevailing at
the time of the utterance . It is a sentence like 'This is red' or 'It is raining,'
which is true on one occasion and false on another; unlike 'Sugar is
sweet,' whose truth value endures regardless of occasion of utterance. In
a word, observation sentences are occasion sentences, not standing sen­
tences.
But their being occasion sentences is not the only distinctive trait of
observation sentences. Not only must the truth value of an observa­
tion sentence depend on the circumstances of its utterance; it must de­
pend on intersubjectively observable circumstances. Certainly the fisher­
man's sentence ' I j ust felt a nibble' is true or false depending on the
circumstances of its utterance; but the relevant circumstances are privy
to the speaker rather than being out in the open for all present witnesses
to sbare. The sentence 'I j ust felt a n i bble' is an occasion sente nce but not
a n observation sentence, i n my sense of the term.
An observation sentence, then, is an occasion sentence whose occasion
is intersubjectively observable. But this is stil l not enough. After all, the
sentence " fhere goes John's old tutor' meets these requirements; it is an
occasion sentence, and all present witnesses can see the old tutor plod­
ding by. But the sentence fails of a third requirement: the witnesses must
i n general be able to appreciate that the observation which they are shar­
ing is one that verifies the sentence. They must have been in a position,
equally with the speaker, to have assented to the sentence on their own in
the circumstances. They are in that position in the case of 'This is red'
and 'It is raining' and 'There goes an old man,' but not in the case of
'There goes John's old tutor. '
Such, then, is an observation sentence: it is a n occasion sentence
whose occasion is not only intersubj ectivcly observable hut is generally
adequate, mo reover, to elicit assent to the sentence from any present wit­
ness conversant with the language. It is not a report of private sense
data; typically, rather, it contains references to physical obj ects .

The Nature of Natural Knowledge

These sentences, I say, are keyed directly to observation. But how
k eyed, now-what is the nature of the connection ? It is a case of condi­
tioned response. It is not quite the simplest kind; we do not say 'red' or
'This is red' whenever we see something red. But we do assent i f asked.
Mastery of the term 'red' is acquisition of the habit of assenting when
the term is queried in the presence of red, and only in the presence of red.
At the primitive level, an observation sentence is apt to take the form
of a single word, thus 'ball,' or ' red . ' What makes it easy to learn is the
intersubjective o bservability of the relevant circumstances at the time of
utterance. The parent can verify that the child is seeing red at the time,
and so can reward the child's assent to the query. Also the child can ver­
ify that the parent is seeing red when the parent assents to such a query.
In this habit formation the child is in effect determining, by induc­
tion, the range of situations i n which the adult will assent to the query
'red,' or approve the child's utterance of 'red.' He is extrapolating along
simil arity lines; this red episode is similar to that red episode by his
lights. His success depends, therefore, o n substantial agreement between
his similarity standards and those of the adult. Happily the agreement
holds; and no wonder, since our similarity standards are a matter partly
o f natural selection and pa rtly o f subsequent experience in a shared envi­
ronment. If substantial agreement in similarity standards were not there,
this first step in language acquisition would be blocked.
We have been seeing that observation sentences are the starting-points
in the learning of language. Also, they are the starting-points and the
check points of scientific theory. They serve both purposes for one and
the same reason: the intersubj ective observa bility of the relevant circum­
stances at the time of utterance. It is this, intersubj ective observability at
the time, that enables the child to learn when to assent to the observation
sentence . And it is this also, intersubjective o bservability at the time, that
qualifies observation sentences as check points for scientific theory. Ob­
servation sentences state the evidence, to which all witnesses must ac­
cede.
I had characterized science as a linguistic structure that is keyed to ob­
servation at some points. Now we have seen how it is keyed to observa­
tion: some of the sentences, the observation sentences, are conditioned
to observable events in combination with a routine of query and as­
sent. There is the beginning, here, of a partnership between the theory
of language learning and the theory of scientific evidence. It is clear,
when you think about it, that this partnership must continue. For when
a child learns his language from his elders, what has he to go o n ? He can

293

294

QUINTESSEN CE

learn observation sentences by consideration of their observable circum­
stances, as we saw. But how can he learn the rest of the language, includ­
ing the theoretical sentences of science ? Somehow he learns to carry his
observation terms over into theoretical contexts, variously embedded.
Somehow he learns to connect his observation sentences with standing
sentences, sentences whose truth values do not depend o n the occasion
of utterance. It is only by such moves, however ill understood, that any­
one masters the non-observational part of his mother tongue. He can
learn the o bservational part i n firm and well-understood ways, and then
he must build out somehow, imitating what he hears and linking it tenu­
ously and conj ecturally to what he knows, until by dint of trial and so­
cial correction he achieves fluent dialogue with his community. This dis­
course depends, for whatever empirical content it has, on its devious and
tenuous connections with the o bservation sentences; and those are the
same connections, nearly enough, through which one has achieved one's
fluent part in that discour s e . The channels by which, having learned ob­
servation sentences, we acquire theoretical language, are the very chan­
nels by which observation lends evidence to scientific theory. It all stands
to reason; for language is man-made and the locutions of scientific the­
ory have no meaning but what they acquired by our learning to use
them.
We see, then, a strategy for investigating the relation of evidential sup­
port, between observation and scientific theory. We can adopt a genetic
approach, studying how theoretical language is learned. For the eviden­
tial relation is virtually enacted, it would seem, i n the learning. This ge­
netic strategy is attractive because the learning of language goes on in the
world and is open to scientific study. It is a strategy for the scientific
study of scientific method and evidence. We have here a good reason to
regard the theory of language as vital to the theory of knowledge.
When we try to understand the relation between scientific theory and
the observation sentences, we are brought up short by the break between
occasion sentences and standing sentences; for observation sentences are
of the one kind while theoretical sentences are of the other. The scientific
system cannot digest occasion sentences; their substance must first be
converted into standing sentences . The observation sentence 'Rain' or 'It
is raining' will not do; we must put the information into a standing sen­
tence: 'Rain at Heathrow 1600 G.M.T. 23 February 1 974. ' This report is
ready for filing in the archives o f science. It still reports an observation,
but it is a standing report rather than an occasion sentence. How do we
get from the passing observation of rain to the standing report?

The Nature of Natura l Knowledge

This can be explained by a cluster of observations and observation
sentences, having to do with other matters besides the rain. Thus take
the term 'Heathrow. ' Proper names of persons, buildings, and localities
are best treated as o bservation terms, o n a par with 'red' and 'rai n . ' A l l
s u c h terms can be learned by ostension, repeated sufficiently to ,uggest
the intended scope and limits of application. 'Here is Heath row, ' then, is
an o bservation sentence on a par with 'It is raining'; and their conj unc­
tion, 'Raining at Heathrow,' is a n observation sentence as wel l . It is an
occasion sentence still, of course, and not a standing report o f o bserva­
tion . But now the two further needed i ngredients, hour and date, can be
added as pointer readings: 'The clock reads 1 600' and 'Tbe calendar
reads 23 February 1 9 74' are further observation sentences. Taking the
conjunction of all four, we still have an observation sentence: 'Rain at
Heathrow with clock at 1 600 and calendar at 23 February 1 974 . ' But it
is a n observation ,entence with this curious trait: it gives lasting infor­
mation, depen dent no longer on the vicissitudes of tense or of i n d i cator
words like 'here' and 'now. ' It is suita ble for filing.
True, the clock and calendar may have been wrong. A, a n observation
sentence our report must be viewed as stating the temporal readings and
not the temporal facts. The question of the temporal facts belongs to sci­
entific theory, somewhat above the observational level. Theoretical re­
percussions of this and other o bservations could eventual l y even prompt
a modest scientific hypothesis to the effect that the clock or the calendar
had been wrong.
I think this example serve, pretty well as a paradigm case, to show
how we can get from the occasion sentences of observation to the stand­
ing reports of observation that a re needed for scientific theory. But this
connection is by n o means the only connection between observation sen­
tences and standing sentences. Thus consider the universal categorical,
'A dog is an anima l . ' This is a standing sentence, but it is not, like the ex­
ample of rain at Heathrow, a standing report of observatio n . Let us re­
sume o ur genetic strategy: how might a child have mastered such a uni­
versal categorica l ?
I s h a n venture o n e hypothesis, hoping that it m a y be improved upon.
The child ha, learned to assent to the observation term 'a dog' when it is
queried in the conspicuous presence of dogs, and he has learned to assent
to 'an animal' likewise when it is queried i n the conspicuou, presence of
dogs ( though not only dogs ) . Because of his close association of the word
'dog' with dogs, the mere sound of the word ' dog' disposes him to re­
spond to the subsequent query 'an animal' as be would have done I f a

dog had been there; so he assents when he hears 'a dog' followed by the
query, 'an anima l ? . ' Being rewarded for so doing, he ever after assents to
the query 'A dog is an animal ? ' In the same way he learns a few other ex­
amples of the universal categorical. Next he rises to a mastery of the uni­
versal categorical construction 'An S is a P' in genera l: he learns to apply
it to new cases on his own. This important step of a bstraction can per­
haps be explained i n parallel fashion to the early learning of observation
sentences, namely, by simple induction along similarity lines; but the
simil arity now is a language-dependent similarity.
Much the same account can be offered for the learning of the seem­
ingly simpler construction, mere predication: 'Fido is a dog,' 'Sugar is
sweet.'
The child has now made creditable progress from o bservation sen­
tences towards theoretical language, by mastering predication and the
universal categorical construction. Another important step will be mas­
tery of the relative clause; and I th ink I can give a convincing hypothesis
of how this comes a bout. What is conspicuous about the relative clause
is its role in predicati o n . Thus take a relative clause, 'someth i ng that
chases its tail,' and predicate it of Dinah: 'Dinah is something that chases
its tail.' This i, equivalent to the simple sentence 'Dinah chases its tail'
(or 'her tail ' ) . When we predicate the relative clause, the effect is the
same as substituting the subject of the predication for the pronoun of the
relative clause. Now my suggestion regarding the learning of the relative
clause is that the child learns this substitution tran sformation. He dis­
covers that the adult is prepared to assent to a predication of a relative
clause in j ust the circumstances where he is prepared to assent to the sim­
pler sentence obtained by the substitution.
This explains how the child could learn relative clauses in one stan­
dard position: predicative position. He learns how to eliminate them, in
that position, by the su bstitutio n transformation-and how to introduce
them into that position by the converse transformation, superstition. But
then, having learned this much, he is struck by a n analogy between rela­
tive clauses and ordinary simple predicates or general terms; for these
also appear in predicative position. So, pursuing the analogy, he presses
relative clauses into other positions where general terms have been ap­
pearing-notably into the universal categorical construction. Or, if the
child does not press this analogy on his own, he is at any rate well pre­
pared to grasp adult usage and follow it in the light of the analogy. In
this way the relative clause gets into the universal categorical construc-

tion, from which it cannot be eliminated by the su b;tltutlon tran,forn1.l­
tion. It is there to stay.
We can easily imagine how the child might learn the truth functions­
negation, conj unction, alternation. Ta ke conjunction: the chIld notices,
by degrees, that the adult affirms 'p and q ' in only thm,e CirC UlTl5ta nces
where he is disposed, if queried, to assent to 'P' and a l .. o to ' q ' .
We h a v e nOW seen, i n outline and crude conj ecture, h o w one might
start at the observational edge of language and work one\ way into the
discursive i nterior where scientific theory can begl11 to be expressed.
Predication is at hand, and the universal categorical, the relative clause,
and the truth functions. Once this stage is reached, it is easy to �ee that
the whole strength of logical quantification is available. I � h a ll not pause
over the details of this, except to remark that the pro n o u n s of relative
clauses take o n the role of the bound variable of quantification. By fur­
ther conj ectures in the same spirit, some of them more convincing and
some less, we can outline the learner's further progress, to where h e is
bandying abstract terms and quantifyi ng over properties, numbers, func­
tions, and hypothetical physical particles J.nd forces. Thi� progress is not
a continuous derivation, which, followed backward, would enable us to
reduce scientific theory to sheer o bservation. It is a progress rather by
short leaps o f analogy. One such was the pressing of rela tive clJ.u,es into
universal categoricals, where they cease to be eliminable. There a re fur­
ther such psychological speculations that I could report, but time does
not allow.
Such speculations would gain, certainly, from experimental investiga­
tion of the child's actual learning of la nguage. ExpenmentJ.I findings
already available in the literature could perhaps be used to �ustain or
correct these conjectures at points, and further empirical investigations
could be devised. But a speculative approach of the present sort seems
required to begin with, i n order to isolate j ust the factual questions that
bear on our purposes. For our o bjective here is still philosophical-a
better understanding of the relations between evidence and scientific the­
ory. Moreover, the way to this objective requires con;ideratlon of l in ­
guistics and logic along with psychology. T h is is why the speculative
phase has to precede, for the most part, the formulation of relev ant ques­
tions to be posed to the experimental psychologist.
In any event the present speculations, however maccurate, are pre­
sumably true to the general nature of language acquisitIO n . And already
they help us to understand how the logical links are forged that connect

297

298

Q UI N T E S S E N C E

theoretical sentences with the reports of observation. We learn the gram­
matical construction ' p and q ' by learning, among other things, to assent
to the compound only in circumstances where we are disposed to as­
sent to each component. Thus it is that the logical law of inference
which leads from ' p and q ' to 'p ' is built i nto our habits by the very
learning of 'and.' Similarly for the other laws of conj unction, and corre­
spondingly for the laws of alternation and other truth functions. Corre­
spondingly, again, for laws of quantification. The law of inference that
leads form ' ( x ) Fx' to ' Fa' should be traceable back, through the deriva­
tion of quantification that I have passed over, until it is found finally to
h i nge upon the substitution transformation by which we learn to use the
relative clause. Thus, in general , the acquisition of our basic logical hab­
its is to be accounted for in our acquisition of grammatical construc­
tions.
Related remarks hold true of inferential habits that exceed pure logic.
We learn when to assent to 'dog,' and to 'animal,' only by becoming dis­
posed to assent to 'animal' i n all circumstances where we will assent to
'dog.' Connections more accidental and casual i n aspect can also come
about through the learning of words; thus a child may have begun to
learn the term 'good' in applicati o n to chocolate.
I characterized science as a linguistic structure that is keyed to obser­
vation here and there. I said also that it is an instrument for predicting
observations on the basis of earlier observations. It is keyed to observa­
tions, earlier and later, forming a la byrinthine connection between them;
and it is through this labyrinth that the prediction takes place. A power­
ful improvement, this, over simple induction from past observations to
future ones; powerful and costly. I have now sketched the nature of the
connection between the o bservations and the labyrinthine interior of sci­
entific theory. I have sketched it i n terms of the learning of language.
This seemed reasonable, since the scientist himself can make no sense of
the language of scientific theory beyond what goes into his learning of it.
The paths of language learning, which lead from observation sentences
to theoretical sentences, are the only connection there is between obser­
vation and theory. This has been a sketch, but a fuller understanding
may be sought along the same line: by a more painstaking investigation
of how we learn theoretical language.
O ne important point that already stands forth, regarding the relation
of theory to observation, is the vast freedom that the form of the theory
must enj oy, relative even to all possible observation. Theory is empiri-

The Nature of Natural Knowledge

cally under-determined. Surely even if we had an observational oracle,
capahle of assigning a truth value to every standing observational report
expressihle in our language, still this would not suffice to adj udicate be­
tween a host of possible physical theories, each of them completely in ac­
cord with the oracle. This seems clear in view of the tenuousness of the
connections that we have noted between ohservation sentences and the­
oretical ones. At the level of ohservation sentences, even the general
form of the eventual theoretical language remained indeterminate, to say
nothing o f the ontology. The observation sentences were associated, as
wholes, with the stimulatory situations that warranted assent to them;
but there was in this no hint of what aspects of the stimulatory situations
to single out somehow as objects, if indeed any. 'fhe question of ontol­
ogy simply makes no sense until we get to something recognizable as
quantification, or perhaps as a relative clause, with pronouns as poten­
tial variables. At the level of ohservation sentences there was no foresee­
ing even that the superimposed theoretical language would contain any­
thing recognizable as quantification or relative clauses. The steps by
which the child was seen to progress from observational language to rel­
ative clauses and categoricals and quantification had the arbitrary char­
acter of historical accident and cultural heritage; there was no hint of in­
evitability.
It was a tremendous achievement, on the part of our long-term culture
and our latter-day scientists, to develop a theory that leads from obser­
vation to predicted ohservation as successfully as ours. It is a near mira­
cle. If our theory were in full conformity with the observational oracle
that we j ust now imagined, which surely it is not, that would be yet a
nearer miracle. But if, even granted that nearer miracle, our theory were
not still j ust one of many equally perfect possihle theories to the same
observational effect, that would he too miraculous to make sense.
But it must be said that the issue of under-determination proves slip­
pery when we try to grasp it more firmly. I f two theories conform to the
same totality of possible observations, in what sense are they two ? Per­
haps they are both stated in English, and they are alike, word for word,
except that one of them calls molecules electrons and electrons mole­
cules. Literally the two theories are in contradiction, saving incompati­
ble things ahout so-called molecules. But of course we would not want
to count this case; we would call it terminological . Or again, following
Poincare, suppose the two theories are alike except that one of them as­
sumes an infinite space while the other has a finite space in which bodies

299

300

Q U I N T E S S E 1': C I-:

shrink in proportion to their distance from centre. Even here we want to
say that the difference is rather terminological than real; and our reason
is that we see how to bring the theories into agreement by translation: by
r(construing the English of one of the theories.
At this point it may be protested that after all there can never be two
complete theories agreeing on the total output of the observational ora­
cle. It may be protested that since such theories would be empirically
equivalent, would have the same empirical meaning, their difference is
purely verbal. For surely there is no meaning but empirical meaning, and
theories with the same meaning must be seen as translations one of the
other. This argument simply rules out, by definition, the doctrine that
physical theory is under-determined by all possible observation.
The best reaction at this point is to back away from terminology and
sort things out on their merits. Where the significant difference comes is
perhaps where we no longer see how to state rules of translation that
would bring the two empirically equivalent theories together. Terminol­
ogy aside, what wants recognizing is that a physical theory of radically
different form from ours, with nothing even recognizably similar to our
quantification or obj ective reference, might still be empirically equiva­
lent to ours, in the sense of predicting the same episodes of sensory bom­
bardment on the strength of the same past episodes. O nce this is recog­
nized, the scientific achievement of our culture becomes in a way more
impressive than ever. For, in the midst of all this formless freedom for
variation, our science has developed in such a way as to maintain always
a manageably narrow spectrum of visible a lternatives among which to
choose when need arises to revise a theory. It is this narrowing of sights,
or tunnel vision, that has made for the continuity of science, through the
vicissitudes of refutation and correction. And it is this also that has fos­
tered the illusion of there being only one solution to the riddle of the uni­
verse .

FIVE MILESTO NES O F EMPIRICISM

I n the past two centuries there have been five points where empiricism
has taken a turn for the better. The first is the shift from ideas to words.
The second is the shift of semantic focus fro m terms to sentences. The
third is the shift of semantic focus from sentences to systems of sen­
tences . The fourth is, in Morton White's phrase, methodological mo­
nism: abandonment of the analytic-synthetic dualism. The fifth i s natu­
ralism: abandonment of the goal of a first philosophy prior to natural
science. I shall proceed to elaborate on each of the five.
The first was the shift of attention from ideas to words. This was the
adoption of the policy, in epistemology, of talking about linguistic ex­
pressions where possible instead of ideas. This policy was of course pur­
sued by the medieval nominalists, but I think of it as entering modern
empiricism only i n 1 78 6 , w h e n t h e philologist John Horne Tooke wrote
as follows: " The greatest part of Mr. Locke's essay, that is, all which re­
lates to what he calls the abstraction, complexity, generalization, rela­
tion, etc . , of ideas, does indeed merely concern language . " 1
British empiricism was dedicated t o the proposition that only sense
makes sense. Ideas were acceptable only if based on sense impressions.
But Tooke appreciated that the idea idea itself measures up poorly to em­
piricist standards. Translated into Tooke's terms, then, the basic proposi­
tion of British empiricism would seem to say that words make sense only
insofar as they are definable in sensory terms.
At this point, trouble arises over grammatical particles: what of our
prepositions, our conj unctions, our copula? These are i ndispensable to

QUINTESSENCE

coherent discourse, yet how are they definahle i n sensory terms ? John
Horne Tooke adopted a heroic line here, arguing that the particles were
really ordinary concrete terms i n degenerate form. He advanced inge­
nious etymologies: 'if' was 'give,' 'but' was 'be out.' However, this line
was needless and hopeless. If we could make concrete terms do all the
work of the grammatical particles, we could make them do so without
awaiting j ustification from etymologists. But surely we cannot, and there
is no valid reason to want to; for there is another approach to the prob­
lem of defining the grammatical particles i n sensory terms. We have only
to recognize that they arc syncategorematic. They are defina hle not in
isolation but i n context.
This hrings us to the second of the five turning points, the shift from
terms to sentences. The medievals had the notion of syncategorema­
tic words, hut it was a contemporary of John Horne Tooke who devel­
oped it into an explicit theory of contextual definition; namely, Jeremy
Bentham. He applied contextual definition not j ust to grammatical parti­
cles and the like, but even to some genuine terms, categorematic ones.
If he found some term convenient but ontologically embarrassing, con­
textual definition enabled him in some cases to continue to enjoy the
services of the term while disclaiming its denotation. He could declare
the term syncategorematic, despite grammatical appearances, and then
could justify his continued lise of it i f he could show systematically how
to paraphrase as wholes all sentences in which he chose to imhed it. Such
was his theory of fictions: 2 what he called paraphrasis, and what we now
call contextual definition. The term, like the grammatical particles, is
meaningful as a part of meaningful wholes. If every sentence in which we
use a term can he paraphrased into a sentence that makes good sense, no
more can be asked.
Comfort could he derived from Bentham'S doctrine of paraphrasis
hy all who may have inherited Berkeley's and Hume's misgivings over
abstract ideas. Reconsidered in the spirit of John Horne Tooke, these
misgivings become misgivings over ahstract terms; and then Bentham's
approach offers hope of accommodating such terms, in some contexts
a nyway, without conceding an ontology of ahstract ohjects. I am per­
suaded that one cannot thus make a clean sweep of all abstract oh­
j ects without sacrificing much of science, including classical mathemat­
ics . But certainly one can pursue those nominalistic aims much further

than could have been clearly conceived in the days before Bentham and
Too k e .
Contextual definition precipitated a revolution in semantics: less sud­
den perhaps than the Copernican revolution in astronomy, but like it in
being a shift of center. The primary vehicle of meaning is seen no longer
as the word, but as the sentence. Terms, l ike grammatical particles, mean
by contributing to the meaning of the sentences that contain them. The
helioccntrism propounded by Copernicus was not obvious, and neither
is this. It is not obvious because, for the most part, we understand sen­
tences only by construction from understood words. This is necessar­
ily so, since sentences are potentially infinite i n variety. We learn some
words in isolation, i n effect as one-word sentences; we learn further
words i n context, by learning various short sentences that contain them;
and we understand further sentences by construction from the words
thus learned. I f the language that we thus learn is afterward compiled,
the manual will necessarily consist for the most part of a word-by-word
dictionary, thus obscuring the fact that the meanings of words are ab­
so·actions from the truth conditions of sentences that contain them.
It was the recognition of this semantic primacy of sentences that gave
us contextual definition, and v ice versa . [ attrib uted this to Bentham.
Generations later we find Frege celebrating the semantic primacy of sen­
tences, and Russell giving contextu al definition its fullest exploitation in
tech nical logic. But Bentham's contribution had not been Iving ineffec­
tive all that while. [n the course of the nineteenth century a practice
emerged in the differential calculus of using differential operators as
simulated coefficients while recognizing that the operators were rea lly
intelligible only as fragments of larger terms. It was this mage, i ndeed,
rather than Bentham 's writings, that directlv inspired Ru"el \ 's contex­
tual definitions.3
In consequence of the shift of attention from term to sentence, episte­
mology came in the twentieth century to be a critique not primarilv of
concepts but of truths and beliefs. The verification theory of meaning,
which dominated the Vienna Circle, was concerned with the meaning
and meaningfulness of sentences rather than of words. The English phi­
losophers of ordinary language have likewise directed their analyses to
sentences rather than to words, in keeping with the example that was set

by both the earlier and the later work of their mentor Wittgenstein.
Bentham's lesson penetrated and permeated epistemology in the ful l ness
of time.
The next move, number three in my five, shifts the focus from sen­
tences to systems of sentences. We come to recognize that in a scientific
theory even a whole sentence is ordinarily too short a text to serve as an
independent vehicle of empirical meaning. It will not have its separahle
bundle of observahle or testa ble consequences. A reasonably inclusive
body of scientific theory, taken as a whole, will indeed have such conse­
quences. The theory will imply a lot of observation conditionals, as I call
them,' each of which says that if certain observable conditions are met
then a certa in observable event will occur. But, as Duhem has empha­
sized, these observation conditionals arc implied only by the theory as a
whole. If any of them proves false, then the theory is false, but on the
face of it there is no saying which of the component sentences of the the­
ory to blame. The observation conditionals cannot be distributed as con­
sequences of the several sentences of the theory. A single sentence of the
theory is apt not to imply any of the observation conditionals.
The scientist does indeed test a single sentence of his theory by obser­
vation conditionals, but only through having chosen to treat that sen­
tence as vulnerable and the rest, for the time being, as firm. This is the
situation when he is testing a new hypothesis with a view to adding it, if
he may, to his growing system of beliefs .
When w e l o o k thus to a whole theory or system of sentences as the ve­
hicle of empirical meaning, how inclusive should we take this system to
be? Should it be the whole of science ? or the whole of a science, a branch
of science ? This should be seen as a matter of degree, and of diminishing
returos. A l l sciences interlock to some extent; they share a common logic
and general l y some common part of mathematics, even when nothing
else. It is an uninteresting legalism, however, to think of our scientific
system of the world as involved en bloc in every prediction. More mod­
est chunks suffice, and so may be ascribed their independent empirical
meaning, nearly enough, since some vagueness in meaning must be al­
lowed for in any event.
It would also be wrong to suppose that no single sentence of a theory
has its separable empirical meaning. Theoretical sentences grade off to
observation sentences; observationality is a matter of degree, namely, the
4. See QUll1e, Theones and Things, Essay 2 ( " Emplrlcal Conten t " ) .

Five Milestones of EmpiriCIsm

degree of spontaneous agreement that the sentence would command
from present witnesses. And while i t may be argued that even an obser­
vation sentence may be recanted in the light of the rest of one's the­
ory, thIS is a n extreme case and happily not characteristic. And in any
event there will be single sentences at the other extreme-long theoreti­
cal ones-that surely have their separable empirical meaning, for we can
make a conj unctive sentence of a whole theory.
Thus the holism that the third m ove brings should be seen only as a
moderate or relative holism. What is important is that we cease to de­
mand or expect of a scientific sentence that it have its own separable em­
pirical meaning.
The fOll rth move, to methodological monism, follows closely on this
holism. Holism blurs the supposed contrast between the synthetic sen­
tence, with its empirical content, and the analytic sentence, with its null
content. The organizing role that was supposedly the role of analytic
sentences is now seen as shared by sentences generally, and the empirical
content that was supposedly peculiar to synthetic sentences is now seen
as di ffused through the system.
The fifth move, finally, brings naturalism: abandonment of the goal of
a first philosophy. It sees natural science as an inquiry into reality, fal l i ble
a n d corrigible but not answerable to any supra-scientific tribunal, and
not i n need of any j ustification bevond observation and the hypothetico­
deducttve method. Naturalism has two sources, both negative. One of
them is despair of being able to define theoretical terms generally i n
terms of phenomena, e v e n by contextual definition. A holistic or system­
centered attItude should suffice to induce this despair. The other negative
so urce of n a turalism is unregenerate realism, the robust state of mind of
the natural scientist who has never felt any qualms beyond the negotia­
hIe uncertainties internal to science. Naturalism had a representative al­
ready i n 1 8 3 0 in the antimetaphysician Auguste Comte, who declared
that ·'positive philosophy" does not differ in method from the special
sciences.
Naturalism does not repudiate epistemology, but assimilates it to em­
pirical psychology. Science itself tells us that our information about the
world i s limited to irritations of our surfaces, and then the epistemo­
logical question is in turn a question within science: the question how
we human animals can have managed to arrive at science from such lim­
ited i nformation. Our scientific epistemologist pursues this inquiry and
comes out with an account that has a good deal to do with the learn ing

305

of language and with the neurology of perception . He talks of how men
posit bodies and hypothetical particles, but he does not mean to suggest
that the things thus posited do not exist. Evolution and natural selection
will doubtless figure in this account, and he will feel free to apply physics
if he sees a way.
The naturalistic philosopher begins his reasoning within the inherited
world theory as a going concern. He tentatively believes all of it, but be­
l ieves also that some unidentified portions are wrong. He tries to im­
prove, clarify, and understand the system from within. He is the busy
sailor adrift on Neurath's boat.

O N M E N TA L E N T I T I E S

A question which is very much in the air is whether we should a ffirm or
deny that there are such things as sensations, these being conceived as
immediate, subjective experiences. r shall touch on this question, but not
just yet. For a while it will be convenient to talk as if there arc.
Falling in thus uncritically with the usage of old-fashioned epistemol­
ogy and i ntrospective psychology, let us consider, to begin with, the pro­
cess of language. It has been the fashion in recent philosophy, both that
of some of the English analysts and that of some of the logical positiv­
ists, to think of the terms of science and ordinary language as having
some sort of hidden or i mplicit defini tions which carry each such term
back finally to terms relating to immediate experience. Now this view is
clearly unrealistic. A better description, though countenancing the no­
tion of immediate experience still, is as follows. O n the one hand we
have language, as an infinite totality of said or appropriately sayable
phrases and sentences. On the other hand we have our sense experi­
ence, which, by a process of psychological association or conditioned re­
sponse, is keyed in with the linguistic material at numerous and varied
places. The linguistic material is an interlocked system which is tied here
and there to experience; it is not a society of separately established terms
and statements, each with its separate empirical definition. There is no
separate meaning, in terms of d irect experience, for the statement that
there is a table here, or that there is a planet somewhere in outer space.
The statement that there is the planet may be keyed with our sense expe­
rience by our seeing the planet, or by our merely noting perturbations in
the orbits of other planets. And even the statement that there is a table
right here may be keyed with our sense experience through touch or
sight or hearsay. Again the statement that J have cut my finger may be
307

tied with experience either by sight or by pain or both. I have often ar­
gued that it is mistaken to try to distinguish even between those scientific
statements which are true by virtue of the meanings of our terms and
those which arc true or probable by inductive evidence. As Pierre Duhem
urged, it is the system as a whole that is keyed to experience. It is taught
by exploitation of its heterogeneous and sporadic links with experience,
and it stands or falls, is retained or modified, according as it continues to
serve us well or ill in the face of continuing experience.
We get the system, in its main lines, from our fore bears. As children
learning the language, we get on to various simple terms and key phrases
by direct association with appropriate experiences. When we have pro­
gressed a bit with this kind of learning, we learn further usages contextu­
ally. Eventually we are in a position to receive traditional doctrine a
whole chapter at a time. finally some men venture to revise the tradition
here and there, for the sake of greater simplicity or better experiential
links; and these are scientists .
So much for the individual's mastery of language and lore; but what of
the origins of all this in the race ? It would be irrational to suppose that
those origins were rational. The prehistory of science was probably a
composite of primitive unconscious symbolism of the Freudian kind,
confusions of sign and obj ect, word magic, wishful thinking, and a lazy
acquiescence in forms whose motivation had been long forgotten. Biases
in our conceptual schemes may have great utility in the systematizing
of science, and therewith high survival value, despite humble origins
in the random workings of unreason-j ust as chance mutations in the
chromosome may launch a sturdy and efficient new race. Natural selec­
tion through the ages tends to favor the happy accidents at the expense
of the unpropitious ones, in the evolution of ideas as in the evolution of
living species.
As scientists we accept provisionally our heritage from the dim past,
with intermediate revisions by our more recent fore hears; and then we
continue to warp and revise. As Neurath has said, we are in the position
of a mariner who must rebuild his ship plank by plank while continuing
to stay afloat on the open sea.
Ilow do we decide on sllch retentions and revisions? To be more spe­
cific: how do we decide, apropos of the real world, what things there
are? Ultimately, I think, by considerations of simplicity plus a pragmatic
guess as to how the overall system will continue to work in connec­
tion with experience. We posit molecules, and eventually electrons, even

On Mental Entitle,

though these arc not given to direct experience, merely beca llse they COI1 tribute t o an overall system which is simpler as a whole t h a n i t s known
alternatives; the empirical relevance of the notion of molecules and elec­
trons is indirect, and exists only by virtue of the links with experience
which exist at other points of the system. Actu a l l v I expect t h a t tahles
and sheep are, in the last analysis, on much the same footing as mole­
cules and electrons. Even these have a contmu lllg right to a place in our
conceptual scheme only by virtue of their indirect contribution to the
overall simplicity of our l inguistic or conceptual organization of experi­
ence; for note that even tahles and sheep a re not direct sensatio",.
The notion of macroscopic obj ects, tables and sheep, differs from that
of molecules and electrons mainly, from an epistemological POll1t of
view, in point of degree of antiquity. M o lecules were posited comClomlv
in historic times, whereas the positing of the external objects of common
sense is a n original trait of human nature. Men have bel ieved in some­
thing very like our common-sense world ot external objects ,1 5 l ong,
surely, as anything properly describable as l a nguage has existed; for the
teaching of language and the use of it for communication depend on i n ­
vesting linguistic forms with intersubjectively fi x e d references. It would
be senseless to speak of a motive for this archaic and unconscio u s posit,
but we can significantly speak of its function and its survival value; and
in these respects the hypothesis of common-sense external objects i s
quite l i k e that of molecules and electrons.
Because the notion of external macroscopic obj ects is so fundamental
both to the origins of langu:lge and to the continued learning of lan­
guage, we may be pretty sure that it IS here to stay, though electro n s and
other more hypothetical entities may, with the continued revisions of sci­
ence, come and go. Experience is continuallv reminding us that it I S over
the external macroscopic objects that there is least semantical misunder­
standing between speakers; it is naturally to tables a n d sheep a n d the l i k e
t h a t we k e e p returning w h e n there is trouble a b o u t n e w concepts.
Epistemologists, put off by the fact that macroscopic obj ects arc epis­
temologically on the same footing as molecules and electron s , h ave
looked to sense data-the raw content of sensation itself-as a more ul­
timate realm of entities. The ensuing d ifficulties are notorious. They may
be seen most vividly i f to begin with we think about memory. Our pres­
ent data o f our own past experiences are, on this theory, some sort of
faint present replicas of past sense impressions; faint echoes of past sen­
sation accompanying the blare of present sensation. Now it takes l ittle

.1 09

soul-searching to persuade oneself that such double impressions, dim
against bright, are rather the exception than the rule. Ordinarily we do
not remember the trapezoidal sensory surface of a desk, as a color patch
extending across the lower half of the visual field; what we remember is
that there was a desk meeting such-and-such approximate specifications
of form and size in three-dimensional space. Memory is j ust as much a
product of the past positing of extra-sensory obj ects as it is a datum for
the positing of past sense data.
What has been said j ust now of memory applies in some degree to the
stream of sensory experience generally. It would be increasingly appar­
ent from the findings of the Gestalt psychologists, if it were not quite ap­
parent from everyday experience, that our selective awareness of present
sensory surfaces is a function of present purposes and past conceptual­
izations. The contribution of reason cannot be viewed as limited merely
to conceptualizing a presented pageant of experience and positing ob­
j ects behind it; for this activity reacts, by selection and emphasis, on
the qualitative make-up of the pageant itself in its succeeding portions.
It is not a n instructive oversimplification, but a basic falsification, to rep­
resent cognition as a discernment of regularities in an unadulterated
stream of experience. Better to conceive of the stream itself as polluted,
at each succeeding point of its course, by every prior cognition.
So the notion of pure sense datum is a pretty tenuous abstraction, a
good deal more conjectural than the notion of an external o bject, a table
or a sheep. It is significant that when we try to talk of the subj ective we
borrow our terminology from the objective: I feel as if I were falling, I
have a sinking sensation, I feel on top of the world, I see pink elephants
( better: I feel as if I were really seeing real pink elephants ) , etc. Even the
terms which we have come to regard as strictly and immediately sensory,
like 'red,' are obviously obj ective in reference in the first instance: we
learn the word 'red' by being confronted with an external obj ect which
our parent calls red, just as we learn the word 'sheep' by being con­
fronted with an external obj ect which our parent calls a sheep. When, at
a certain stage o f epistemological sophistication, we transfer the word
'red' to an alleged datum of immediate subj ective sense experience, we
are doing just what we do when we say we have a sinking sensation: I
feel as if ! were really, externally falling, and I fee l as if ! were really con­
fronted by an external red obj ect.
I suggest that it is a mistake to seek an immediately evident reality,
somehow more immediately evident than the realm of external objects.

On :Vlental Entities

Un bemused by philosophy, we would all go along with Dr. Johnson,
whose toe was his touchstone o f reality. Sheep arc real, unicorns not.
Clouds are real, the sky ( a s a solid canopy ) n o t . Odd numbers a r c per­
haps real, but prime even numbers other than 2 not. Everything, of
course, is real; but there are sheep and there are n o unicorns, there are
clouds and there is (in the specified sense of the term ) no sky, there are
odd numbers and there arc no even primes other than 2 . Such is the ordi­
nary usage of the word 'real,' a separation of the sheep from the uni­
corns. failing some aberrant definition which is certainly not before us,
this is the only usage wc have to go on.
'fhe crucial insight of empiricism is that any evidence for science has
its end points in the senses. This insight remains valid, but it is an insight
which comes after physics, physiology, and psychology, not before. Epis­
temologists have wanted to posit a realm of sense data, situated some­
how j ust me-ward of the physical stimulus, for fear of circularity: to
view the physical stimulation rather than the sense datum as the end
point of scientific evidence would be to make physical science rest for its
evidence on physical science. But if with Neurath we accept th is circular­
i ty, simply recognizing that the science of science is a science, then we
d ispose of the epistemological motive for assuming a realm of scnse
data. May we then make a clean sweep of mental entities ?
I urged earlier that we decide what things there are, or what things to
treat as there being, by considerations of simplicity of the overall system
and its utility in connection with experience, so to speak . I say " so to
speak " because I do not want to force the issue o f recognizing experience
as an entity or composite of e ntities. I have talked up to now as i f there
were such entities; I had to talk some language, and I uncriticallv talked
this one. But the history of the mind-body problem bears witness to the
awkwardness of the practice. We are virtually bound, as remarked ear­
lier, to hold to a n ontology of external objects; hut it is moot indeed
whether the positing of additional obj ects of a mental kind is a help or a
hindrance to science. Or perhaps not so moot. At any rate it is moot or
else it is clear that they are a hindrance.
To repudiate mental entities is not to deny that we sense or even that
we are conscious; it is merely to report and try to describe these facts
without assuming entities of a mental kind. What is spoken of in terms
of the residual posited obj ects of science and common sense as my cut
finger is keyed into our nervous responses i n various ways; nerves from
my eve and other eyes are involved, and nerves from my finger. Some

cause of a pattern of ha bIts connecting with present and past stimulation

stances, of o ur own finge " . The same is true o f pain-but no argument
against comtruing pain as a state of the phvsical organism. If we repudi­
ate mental entities as entities, there ceaSes to be a n iron curtai n between
the private and the pu blIc; there remains only a smoke screen, a matter
of varving degrees of pnv,lCy of events in the physica l wor l d . Conscious­
ness still reta m s a place, a s a state of a phvsical obj ect, i f-following the
suggestion m,lcle by Prole"or Deutsch in addressing this institute last
year-we construe cOlbciousness as a faculty of responding to one's own
responses. The responses here are, or can be construed as, physical be­
havior. It is not the purpose of this view to leave any aspect of life out of
account. The issue is merely whether, in an ideal last accounting o f ev­
erything or a present practical accounting of everything we can, it is
efficacious so to frame our conceptual scheme as to mark out a range of
entities or lmits o f a so-called mental kind in addition to the physical
ones. My hypotheSIS, put forward i n the spirit of a hypothesis of natural
science. is that it 1 " not cHlcaciolls.

M I N D A N D V E R B A L D I S P O SITI O N S

Descanes supposed that man i s the only a n imal endowed with mind; the
others a re automata. It is held further, and more widely and on better ev­
idence, that man is the only animal endowed with language. N ow i f man
is unique in enjoying these two gifts, it is no coincidence. One mav argue
that no mindless creature could cope with so intricate a device as lan­
guage. Or one may argue conversely that no appreciable mental activity
is conceivable without linguistic aids.
Most thought simply is speech, according to the p ioneer behaviourist
John B. Watson: silent, repressed, incipient speech. Not all thought is
that. A geometer or a n engineer may thi n k by means also of little incipi­
ent tugs of the muscles that are used i n drawing curves or twirling cog­
wbeels. Sti ll, the muscles that play by far the major role, according to
Watson's muscular theory o f meditation, are the muscles used in making
speeches.
Conversely, there is an age-old and persi stent tendency to try to ex­
plain and analyse the physical phenomenon of speech by appealing to
mind, mental activity, and mental entities: by appealing to thoughts,
ideas, meanings. Language, we are told, serves to convey ideas. We learn
language from our el ders by learning to associ ate the words with the
same ideas with which our elders have learned to associate them. Thus it
is, we may he told, that approximate un iformity of association of words
with ideas is achieved and maintained throughout the community.
Such an account would of course be extravagantly perverse. 'rhus con­
sider the case where we teach the infant a word by reinforcing his ran­
dom babbling on some appropriate occasion. His chance utterance bears
a chance resemblance to a word appropriate to the occasion, and we re­
ward him. The occasion must be some object or some stimulus source

that we as well ,1S the child are i n a position to n otice. Furthermore, we
must be in a position to o bserve that the child is i n a position to notice it.
Only thus would there be a n v purpose i n our rewarding his chance utter­
ance . In so doing we encourage the child to repeat the word on future
similar occasions. flut are we causing him to associate the word with the
same Idea that we adults associate it with ? Do we adults all associate it
with the same idea ourselves, for that matter ) And what would that
I11 C an ?
The mora l of this is that the fixed points are just the shared stimulus
a n d the word; the ideas in between arc as may be and may vary as they
please, so long as the external stimulus in question stays paired up with
the word in question for all concerned. 'rhe point i s well dramatized bv
the familiar fantasv of complementary colour percepti o n . W h o kn ows
but that I see things in colours opposite to those i n which you sec the
things ? For communication it is a matter of indifference.
I believe in the a ffinity o f mind and la nguage, but I want to keep the
relation right side up. Watso n 's theory o f thought, however inadequate,
has matters right SIde up. A theory of mind can gain clarity and suh­
stance, I think, from a better understanding o f t h e workings of language,
whereas little understanding of the workings o f language is to be hoped
for i n mentalistic terms.
I shall say a little about how it is that people feel drawn to a mental­
istic account of language, despite the conspicuous fact that language is a
social enterprise which is keyed to i ntersubj ectively observable obj ects in
the external world. Also I shall speculate o n how we might hope to get
on with a properlv physicalistic account of language. First I must talk a
little more about learning.
I mentioned one primitive way of learning a word: through reinforce­
ment of random bab bling. Another way, somewhat the reverse, is imita­
tion. In the case of babbling it was the adult that witnessed what was
confronting the child when the child chanced to babble the appropriate
word. In the case of imitation it is the child, conversely, that witnesses
what is confronting the adult when the adult volunteers the word. The
child then volunteers the word when similarly confronted, and there­
upon the adult proceeds to reinforce the child's hehaviour j ust as in the
case of babbling. The imitation method is more sophisticated than the
babbling method. It can still be explained, indirectly, i n terms of stimulus
and reltl forced response; but I won't pause over it.
What we do need to notice is that all la nguage learning at this primi-

Mind a n d Verbal Di spoSItIons

tive level is directed only to the learning of what mav be called observa­
tion terms, or, more properly, observation sentences. The child learm to
assent to the query 'red ? ' in the conspicuous presence of red things. A.bo
he masters the trick of getting the object by uttering the word; 'red' is a
poor example here, but 'ball' and 'milk' and 'Mama' are clear cases.
Also he masters the word in a passive way, responding in some distinc­
tive fashion on hearing it. He may respond by turning to face the object,
or by fetching it.
Now the ohservation term, or ohservatioll sentence, is a ground on
which John the rational animal a n d Fido the automaton can meet and to
some degree communicate. The dog learns o bservation sentences in his
passive way. He learns to respond to them by salivating, bv running to
the kitchen, by turning to face the obj ect, or by fetching it.
Already at this lowly level of o bservation sentences the small child dif­
fers from the dog, it may seem, in that he learns the sentences also ac­
tively: he utters them. This still is not a clear contrast. D ogs learn to ask
for things, i n their inarticulate way. Let us not arrogate to rationalitv
what may be merely superior agilitv of lips and tongue a n d larynx.
Premack and his chimpanzee have circumvented these muscular obsta­
cles by resorting to plastic symbols, which they push around on a board.
Premack succeeds in teaching his chimpanzee to volunteer o bservation
sentences appropriately and to play a passable game of query and assent.
A contrast that has long been remarked, between human language and
animal signals, is the combinatorial productivity of language: man's abil­
ity to compose new and unprecedented sentences from old materials,
and to respond appropriately to such new creations. But ['remack rc­
ports that his chimpanzee even passes this test, within modest limits. It
would thus appear that combinatorial productivity in language affords
no sharp l i ne between man and beast. Man may plume himsel f on hav­
ing been the first to develop a combinatoriallv productive language, but
the ability to learn it may be more widespread.
Combinatorial productivity, however, is not the only trait that has
seemed to di stinguish mind-governed discourse from the performance
of trained a n imals. A. major factor is the unpredictable spontaneitv of
speech. Animal drives are still at work behind the torrent of human
speech, but they are seldom clearly to be traced. Even if in our verbal
output we differ from Premack's chimpanzee only in degree and not in
kind, still it is this overwhelming difference of degree that invites the
mentalistic accounts of verbal behaviour. The torrent of words is scen as

315

l16

a manifestation of the speaker's inner life beyond animal drives. Nowa­
days one is apt to resort thus to a mentalistic semantics not so much be­
cause one sees an ontological gulf between man and the apes, as because
one despairs of adhering to the standards of natural science in coping
with the complexities of intelligent discourse.
The central notion in mentalistic semantics is an unanalysed notion of
meaning. It figures mainly i n two contexts: where we speak of k nowing
the meaning of an expression, and where we speak of sameness of mean­
ing. We say we know the meaning of an expression when we arc able to
produce a clearer or more familiar expression having the same meaning.
We ask the meaning of an expression when what we want is a clearer or
more familiar expression having the same meaning.
I said to my small son, 'Eighty-two . You know what I mean ? ' lIe said,
'No . ' Then I said to my small daughter, 'Ottantadue. You know what I
mean ? ' She said, ' Yes. Eightv-tw o . ' I s a i d , 'See, Margaret understands
Italian better than Douglas understands Englis h . '
Our w a y s of talking of meaning a r e thus misleading. To understand an
expression is, one would say, to know the meaning; and to know the
meaning is, one would say, to be able to give the meaning. Yet Douglas
could rightly claim to understand the expression ' cighty-two, ' despite
answering 'No' to ' You know what I mean ? ' lie answered 'No' because
he was unable to give the meaning; and he was unable to give the mean­
ing because what we call giving the meaning consists really in the asym­
metrical operation of producing an equivalent expression that is clearer.
Margaret was ready with a clearer equivalent of 'ottantadue, ' but
Douglas was at a loss for a still clearer equivalent of 'eighty-two . ' In an­
other context he might have ventured, ' Yes, you mean the temperature is
eighty-two. '
People persist in talking thus of knowing the mcaning, and of giving
the meaning, and of sameness of meaning, where they could omit men­
tion of meaning and merely talk of understanding an expression, or talk
of the equivalence of expressions and the paraphrasing of expressions.
They do so because the notion of meaning is felt somehow to eX/Jlain
the understanding and equivalence of expressions. We understand ex­
pressions by knowing or grasping thei r meanings; and one expression
serves as a translation or paraphrase of another because they mean the
same. It is of course spurious explanation, mentalistic explanation at its
worst. The paradoxical little confusion between understanding 'eighty­
two' and knowing or giving its meaning is always symptomatic o f awk-

Mind a n d Ve rbal Di'poSJtion;

ward concept-building; but where the real threat lies, i n talking of mean­
ing, is in the illusion of explanation .
In all we may distinguish three levels of purported explanation, three
degrees o f depth: the mental, the behavioura l , and the phvsiological . The
mental is the most superficial of these, scarcely deserving the name of ex­
planation. 'fhe physiological is the deepest and most ambitious, and it is
the place for camal explanations. The behavioural level, in between, is
what we must settle for i n our descriptions of language, in our formula­
tions of language rules, and in our explications of semantical terms. It is
here, i f anywhere, that we must give our account of the understanding of
an expressio n , and our account o f the equivalence that holds between a n
expression and i t s translation or paraphrase. These things need to be ex­
plained, i f at all, in behavioural terms : in terms of dispositions to overt
gross behaviour.
Take understanding. Part of the understanding o f a word consists in
the ability to use it properly in all manner of admissible contexts. Part
consists in reacting properly to all such uses. So there is a good deal here
to sort out and organize. We must divide and define. To begin with we
can set aside the complication o f the myriad sentential contexts of a
word, by beginning rather with sentences as wholes: with complete l ittle
isol ated speeches, consisting perhaps of a single word and perhaps of
more.
Bewildering variety confronts us even so. One and the same little sen­
tence may be uttered for various purposes: to warn, to remind, to obtain
possession, to gain confirmation, to gain admiration, or to give pleasure
bv pointing something out. The occasions for uttering one and the same
sentence are so various that we can seldom predict when a sentence will
be uttered or which one it will be. An unpromising setting, this, in which
to explore and exploit verbal dispositions. Somehow we must further di­
vide; we must find some significant central strand to extract from the
tangle.
Truth will do nicely. Some sentences, of course, do not have truth val­
ues: thus questions and imperatives. Those that do may still be uttered
for a variety of reasons unconn ected with instruction; I j ust now enu­
merated sOlll e . Bur, among these sentences, truth is a great leveller, en­
a b l i ng us to postpone consideration 01 all those troublesome excres­
cences. Here, then, i, an adjusted standard of understanding: a man
understands a sentence i n so far as he knows its truth conditions. This
kind of understanding stops short of humour, irony, innuendo, and other

317

318

QUINTESSENCE

literary values, but it goes a long way. In particular it is all we can ask of
an understanding of the language of science.
We are interested not only in explaining what it is for someone else to
understand a sentence, but also i n setting a standard for ourselves, as
when we try to penetrate a new language and to understand its sen­
tences, or try to teach the language. Our standard, still, is this: give the
truth conditions. lIence Davidson's plan for a semantics in the style of
Tarski's truth definition.
But when I define the understanding of a sentence as knowledge of its
truth conditions I am certainly not offering a definition to rest with; my
term 'kn owledge' is as poor a resting-point as the term 'understanding'
itself.
We were supposed to be getting things down to terms of dispositions
to behaviour. In what behavioural disposition then does a man's knowl­
edge of the truth conditions of the sentence 'This is red' consist? Not,
certainly, in a disposition to affirm the sentence on every occasion of ob­
serving a red ohj ect, and to deny it on all other occasions; it is the dispo­
sition to assent or dissent when asked in the presence or a bsence of red.
Query and assent, query and dissent-here is the solvent that reduces
understanding to verbal disposition. Without this device there would he
no hope of handing language down the generations, nor any hope of
breaking into newly discovered languages. It is primarily hy querying
sentences for assent and dissent that we tap the reservoirs of verhal dis­
position.
This approach applies primarily to terms, or occasion sentences,
rather than to standing sentences. For the disposition to assent to or dis­
sent from the sentence "fhis is red' is marked by a correlation between
assent and the presence of red, and between dissent and the absence of
red, on occasions where the sentence is queried. A standing sentence,
whose truth value remains fixed over long periods, offers no significant
correlation of the kind. Where the method of q ueried assent and dissent
is at its best, indeed, is i n application to occasion sentences of the spe­
cial sort that I have called observation sentences; for the occasions that
make the sentence true are going to have to be intersubjectively recogniz­
able if we are to be able to tell whether the speaker has the disposition in
question. Even in these cases, of course, we remain at the mercy of the
speaker's veracity: we assume when querying him that his assents and
dissents a re sincere. Happily we live in a moral climate where this as­
sumption generally holds up; language could not flourish otherwise.

119

Standing sentences can be queried too, but the stimulating situation at
the time of querying them will usually have n o bearing on the verdict;
and for this reason we cannot identify the un derstanding of a standing
sentence, even approximately, with �1 dispo�ltlon to assent or dissent
when queried on pdrticu lar occa sions. r do not know how, in general,
in terms of behavioural dispositions, to approximate to the notion of
understanding at a l l , when the sentences understood are sta n d ing sen­
tences. Perhaps it cannot be done, t,l king sta n d1I1g sentences one hy one.
O nce i n a while we get a hint of d specifiCcl llv relev.1nt disposition, sti ll,
when we find someone reversing his verdict on a standing sentence in the
face of some ohservatio n . But with all conceiva ble luck we cannot hope
to correlate standing sentences general l y with observations, hecause the
sentences one bv one simply do not have their own separable empirical
implications. A multiplicity of standing sentences will interlock, rather,
as a theory; d n d an observation i n conflict with rhat theory lIl a y b e ac­
c0l11modatcd hy revoking one O f other of the sentenceS-flO one sen­
tence in particula r.
One sees how a semanticist might despair ,lll d seck shelter in the j un ­
gle of mental istic semantics. B u r there arc other courses. Perhaps the
very notion o f understanding, as applied to s ingle standing sentences,
simply cannot he explicated in terms of behavioural dispositions. Per­
haps therefore i t is simply a n untenable notion, notwithstanding our in­
tuitive predilectiom. It stands to reason that a proper semantical analysis
of standing sentences, in terms of behavioura l d ispositions, wi l l be pri­
marilv occupied with the i nrerrebtions of sentences rather than with
standing sentences one hy one.
J mentioned two central semantical norio", which, i n menul istic se­
mantics, arc obscured bv talk of me,lfling. One was the notion o f under­
standing an expression, and the other was the relation of equIvalence be­
tween an expression and its paraphrase. Afterwards I considered what
might be done about understanding. Now what about the other n otion,
the equivalence relati o n ? 1\11 u ch of what r have said about understanding
applies i n parallel fashion to equivalence. H e re, as there, we can COI1l"(­
niently organize our work by looking first to sentences as wholes, seek­
ing an eLJuivalence concept for them. Here, as there, we can usefully nar­
row our problem by focusing on truth conditions and so exploiting a
method of query and assent. And here, of course, as there, the sentences
that prove reasonably amenable are the occasion sentences, especia l l y
t h e observation senlt'nces. W h a t rebtes s u c h a sentence to i t s equivalent

320

Q U I :"J T E S S E N C E

is simply a coi nciding of dispositions: we are disposed to assent to both
sentences in the same circumstances.
Moreover, in a behavioural account of equivalence, j ust as in a bebav­
ioural account of understanding, we encounter difficulty when we move
to standing sentences. Since a man is apt to assent to a standing sentence,
if asked, i n all sorts of circumstances or in none, the coinciding of dispo­
sitions to assent to two standing sentences gives no basis for equating
them.
I am persuaded, indeed, that a satisfactory equivalence concept is im­
possible for standing sentences. My view of this matter can be conveyed
most clearly if we consider translation between two languages. I am per­
suaded that alternative manuals of translation can exist, incompatible
with each other, and both of them conforming fully to the dispositions to
behaviour on the part of the speakers of the two languages. The two
manuals would agree on observation sentences but conflict in some of
the standing sentences. Each manual, being a manual of translation, pur­
ports to specify the equi\Calence relation between sentences and their
translations, and neither manual is right to the exclusion of the other.
crhis i ndeterminacy of translation is unsuspected in mentalistic seman­
tics, because of the facile talk of meaning. Sentences have meanings, and
a translation is right if it has the same meaning. Mentalistic semantics re­
quires that one of two conflicting manuals of translation be wrong,
though it conforms to every speaker's dispositions. Mentalistic seman­
tics thus sets a false goal, which, even though vague and ill defined, tends
to obstruct other lines of th ought.
Of COllrse, translation must go on. Indeterminacy means that there is
more than one way; we can still proceed to develop one of them, as good
as a ny. And, in a more theoretical mood, we must still consider what
counts as evidence for a ll acceptable translation relation, even if the rela­
tion is not unique. The evidence will be behavioural still, of course, even
though the relation is no simple coinciding of behavioural dispositions,
as it was i n the case o f the equivalence of observatio n sentences. We have
to examine rclations of interdependence between verbal dispositions:
systematic interdependences between dispositions to assent to standing
sentences a n d dispositions to assent in certai n circumstances to observa­
tion sentences. Here again, in the problem of equivalence as in the prob­
lem of u nderstanding, it would seem that genetic semantics offers a
likely approach. But we must expect no simple picture, no easy answers.
For it is a question again of the relations of standing sentences to obser-

vation sentences, and hence nothing less t h .l 11 the relarion of scientific
theory to scientific evidence.
Let us then recognize that the semantical study of bnguage is worth
pursuing with all the scru ples of the natura l scientist. We must study lan­
guage as a system of dispositiom to verhal hehavlO ur, a n d not J mt sur­
face listlesslv to the Sargasso Sea of menta l i s m .
It has h e e n obj ected that w h e n I talk of query and ,l"cnt I am n ot re­
a l l y escaping mentalism a fter all, because assent Itself has a menta l COIll ­

bitrary syllable; utterance of the syll a b l e counts a s a"ent only i f there is
the appropriate mental act behind it. Very wel l , let us adopt the term sllr­

I am offering no proper analysis of the propositional attitudes. People
do not volunteer all their beliefs in affirmations. A better criterion of be­
lief is the d isposition to assent if asked; and this still leaves no room for
questioning sincerity. Also there is the problem of allowable latitude of
translation or paraphrase, when the '1/ clause in ' x believes that f!' con­
tains words alien to x's actual vocabulary. This q uestion of allowable lat­
itude of course arises acutely i n indirect discourse itself, ' x said that 1J , '
and it plagues all the idioms of propositional attitude. And finally there
are quandaries over the referential opacity of the idioms of propositional
attitude: quandaries having to do with the substitutivity of i dentity, and
with quantifying into opaque contexts. All i n all, the propositional atti­
tudes are in a bad way. Th ese arc the idioms most stuhbornly at variance
with scientific patterns. Consequently I find it particularly striking that
these, of all idioms, already descrihe mental states in a way that hints at
dispositions to verhal behaviour. A philosophy of mind as verhal disposi­
tion is after all not so very alien to deep-rooted popular attitudes.
I spoke of three levcls of purported explanation: the mental, the be­
havioural, and the physiological. We have j ust now heen contemplating
the second, the behavioural. Now the rclation of this levcl to the third
and deepest, the physiological, begins to be evident when we examine
the notion of a disposition to behaviour and consider what we mean by a
disposition.
A disposition is in my view simply a physical trait, a configuration or
mechanism. It can be a disjunctive physical trait, since like effects can
come of unlike mechanisms. What makes it a disposition is no significant
character of its own, hut only the style in which we happen to specify it.
Thus take the classical example, solubility i n water. This is a physical
trait that can he specified, witb varying degrees of thoroughness, i n vari­
ous ways. It can be described quite fully, I gather, i n terms of the relative
positions of small particles. It can also be described, less fully, by citing a
simple test: put an obj ect in water and see if it dissolves. Instructions for
this convenient test are compactly encoded, as it happens, in the adj ec­
tive 'soluble' itself, with its verb stem 'solu-' and its dispositional ending
'-ble.' The adj ective 'soluble' is a disposition word, and this is an i mpor­
tant classification of words; but the physical traits themselves do not di­
vide into dispositions and others, any more significantly than mankind
divides into passers-by and others. The term 'dispositi o n ' has its sig­
nificant application rather as a preface, each time, to an actual singling
out of some physical trait; thus we may significantly specify some physi-

t\'1ind and Vernal D i spositions

cal trait as the disposition to behave thus and so in such-and-such cir­
cumstances. It is this that is accomplished also, and more laconically, by
dispositional adj ectives such as 'soluble,' 'fragile,' 'docile,' 'portable . '
T h e dispositional way of specifying physical traits is as frequent a n d a s
useful as it is because w e a r e so often n o t prepared, as we n o w happen to
be in the case of solubility, to specify the intended physical trait in other
than the dispositional style.
The dispositional way of specifying physical states and traits is indeed
pretty generally the way of specifying them, except at high levels of sci­
entific theorv. The explicit dispositional idiom does not always appear,
either as the word 'disposition' or as a suffix '-ble' or '-ile'; commonly
the d ispositional force is only implicit. Hardness, for instance, is the dis­
position to resist i f pressed, or to scratch . Redness, said of a body, is the
disposition to blush i n white light. Hardness and redness come finally,
like solubil ity, to be explained in terms of minute structure, but our first
access to these physical traits is di spositional. In fact the same may be
said of the very notion of hody itself; for a body comes to be known, as
Kant remarked, by its disposition to present a repeatable seq lienee of
views as we walk around it or revisit it. True to form, even this disposi­
tion qualifies as a physical mechanism: body. Like the other physical
mechanisms, this one also comes in the fullness of time to be explained
in terms of small particles.
John Stuart Mill's characterization of a hody as 'a permanent possibil­
ity of sensation' was meant i n an idealistic spirit, as a reduction of matter
to sensory disposition. Thanks to symmetry, however, the identity ad­
mits also of a materialistic inversion: corporeality, like solubility, is an
obj ective physical arrangement of particles, but known first in disposi­
tional terms.
Dispositions to behaviour, then, are physiological states or traits or
mechanisms. In citing them dispositionallv we are singling them out by
behavioural symptoms, behavioural tests . Usually we are in no position
to detail them in physiological terms, but in this there is no anomaly;
we also commonly specify ailments per accidens, citing gross signs and
symptoms and knowing no physiological details.
We now see the relation of the second level of explanation, the behav­
ioural, to the third and deepest level, the physiological. At the second
level we treat of dispositions to behaviour, and these dispositions are in­
deed physiological states, hut we identify them only by their hehavioural
manifestations. The deepest explanation, the physiological, would ana-

123

324

QUINTESSENCE

lyse these dispositions in explicit terms of nerve impulses and other ana­
tomically and chemicallv identified organic processes.
Our three levels thus are levels of reductio n : mind consists in disposi­
tions to behaviour, and these are physiological states. We recall that John
B. Watson did not claim that quite all thought was incipient speech; it
was all incipient twitching of muscles, and mostly of speech muscles.
Just so, I would not identify mind quite wholly with verbal disposition;
with Ryle and Sellars I would identify it with behavioural disposition,
and mostly verbal. And then, having construed behavioural dispositions
in turn as phvsiological states, I end up with the so-called identity theory
of mind: mental states arc states of the body.
However, a word of caution is in order regarding the so-called identity
theory. How does it differ from a repudiation theory ? Let us think for a
moment about an analogous question elsewhere, concerning the defini­
tions of natural number i n set theory. We may say that numbers are de­
fined as sets in Frege's way, or in Zerrnelo's way, or in von Neumann's
way, these ways all being good but incompatible. Or we may say that
n umbers may be repudiated, dispensed with; that we can get along with
j ust sets instead, in any of various ways-Frege's way, Zermelo's way,
von Neuman n 's way. This repudiation version has the advantage that we
no longer seem called upon to adjudicate between three identifications of
the natural n umbers, the three being i ncompatihle and yet all somehow
correct.
Correspondingly, instead of saying that mental states are identical
with physiological ones, we could repudiate them; we could claim that
they can be dispensed with, in all our theorizing, i n favour of physiologi­
cal states, these being specified usually not in actual physiological terms
but i n the idiom of hehavioural dispositions. This repudiation version
has a certain advantage, though a different one from what we noted in
the case of number. Its adva ntage here is that it discourages a possible
a buse of the identity theory. For, product though the identity theory is of
hard-headed materialism, we must beware of its sedative use to relieve
intellectual discomfort. We can imagine someone appealing to the iden­
tity theory to excuse his own free and uncritical recourse to mentalistic
semantics. We can imagine him pleading that it is after all just a matter
of physiology, even if no one knows quite how. This would be a sat irony
indeed, and the repudiation theory has the virtue, over the identity the­
ory, of precluding it.
Until we can aspire to actual physiological explanation of linguistic

'vlind a n d Verbal D ispositions

activity in physiological terms, the level at which to work is the middle
one; that of dispositions to overt behaviour. Its virtue is not that it af­
fords causal explanations hut that it is less likely than the mentalistic
level to engender an illusion of heing more explanatory than it is. The
easy familiarity of mentalistic talk is not to he trusted.
Still, among the dispositions to behaviour, some are more explanatory
than others. The ones that we should favour, in explanations, are the
ones whose physiological mechanisms seem likeliest to be detected in the
foreseea hle future. To cite a hehavioural disposition is to posit an unex­
plained neural mechanism, and such posits should he made in the hope
of their submitting some day to a physical explanation.

I am neither an essentialist nor, so far as I k now, an existentialist. B u t I
am a confirmed extensionalist. Extensionalism is a policy I have clung to
through thick, thin, and nearly seven decades of logicizing and philoso­
phizing. I shall now define it, though I was h eeding it before k nowing the
word or having the concept clearly in mind.
I shall call two closed sentences coextensive if they are both true or
both false. Two predicates or general terms or open sentences are coex­
tensive, of course, if they are true of j ust the same obj ects or sequences of
obj ects. Two singular terms are coextensive if they designate the same
obj ect. And finally to the point: an expression is extensional i f replace­
ment of its component expressions by coextensive expressions always
yields a coextensive whole. Extcnsionalism is a predilection for exten­
sional theories.
In defining coextensive ness I lumped predicates, general terms, and
open sentences together. They are what can be predicated of obj ects or
sequences of obj ects, and in that capacity they all three come to the same
thing. 'fhey are what the schematic predicate letters in quantification
theory stand for. Open sentences are the most graphic of the three ren­
derings. Two open sentences are coextensive if they have the same free
variables and agree with each other i n truth-value for all values of those
variables.
The clarity and convenience conferred by extensionality are evident:
free interchangeability of coextensive components salva veritate. When
in particular those components are singular terms, indeed, their inter­
changeability would seem mandatory from any point of view; for this is
simply the substitutivity of identity. Still, "Tom believes that Cicero de­
nounced Catiline" and "To m believes that Tully denounced Catiline"
329

330

QUINTESSENCE

might be respectively true and false despite the identity of Cicero and
Tully. We must come to terms with such cases either by compromising
extensionalism or in some happier way, whereof more anon.
Meanwhile extensionalism faces a challenge from another quarter.
Karel Lamhert has argued 1 that an irreferential singular term such as
" Pegasus " can disrupt extensionality. The predicates " flies if existent"
and " flies and exists " are coextensive, since everything exists. But the
sentence, " Pegasus flies if existent" is vacuously true, since Pegasus is not
existent, whereas " Pegasus flies and exists " is false. So these two sen­
tences are not extensional; their truth values are switched by switching
coextensive predicates.
Happily this threat is thwarted by my practice, for 10 these many dec­
ades, of treating all singular terms as singular descriptions-thus " Pega­
sus" as " (l X ) ( X pegasizes ) . " We may think of the descriptions as defined
contextually, following Russell. Under his definition, where " F" stands
for any predicate, "F(lX ) ( X pegasizes ) " becomes
3x(x and only x pegasizes . Fx) ,
a n d this is false regardless of " f: " So both of Lambert's predicates, both
"flies if existent" and " flies and exists , " must issue in falsehood when the
subj ect is " Pegasus . " Then there is no breach of extensionality.
To reckon " Pegasus flies if existent" true, as Lambert does, we would
have to analyze " Pegasus Hies if existent" into "If Pegasus exists then
Pegasus flies, " using two predicates. Then, treating " Pegasus flies and
exists " correspondingly, we do find the sentences respectively true and
false, as he claims. But our predicates are no longer the coextensive pair
" flies if existent" and " flies and exists " that raised the problem. When
singular description is evaporated into primitive notation, all is in order.
Lambert already recognized this, writing that my way with singular
terms bypasses his challenge to extensionalism. This would indeed ha ve
been a good reason for that early move on my part, but actually my mo­
tive for it back then was j ust simplicity of foundations.
The elimination of singular terms bears also, it might seem, on our
question regarding the singular terms " Tully" and "Cicero . " But that is
another story, and I shall continue to postpone it.
I have discussed extensionality thus far without mentioning classes. I

hasten to do so, for classes are deemed the very paradigms of exten­
sionality. 'rhus far I only defined extensiona lity of an expression: " Re­
placement of its parts by coextensives always yields a coextensive
whole. " But classes are not expressions. They are obj ects, abstract ob­
j ects. 'Ti) bring them into the act I turn rather to the familiar expression
for specifying a class: the class abstract " (x: Fx) . " Being a singular term,
" (x: Fx) " may be thought of as defined as a singular description in the
obvious way, namely as " (/ Y ) ( (V'X) (X E y. = .Fx ) ) , " and then dissolved i nto
Russell's contextual definition of descriptions.
The expression " (x: Fx) " is indeed extensional by my definition. For, if
" Fx " and " Gx" stand for coextensive open sentences, then the singular
terms " (x: Fx) " and " {x: Gx) " designate the same class, the same ab­
stract thing, and such was my definition of coextensiveness of singular
terms. If now we transfer the epithet " extensional" from the class ab­
stract to the class itself, saying that classes are extensional just means
that they are determined by their members.
The one difference hetween classes and properties, apart from meta­
phor and free association, is extensionality: a class is determined by its
mem bers. A property is not in general determined by its instances. I am
told that among normal animals the property of having a heart and the
property of having k i d neys arc coextensive, but we would never call
them the same property. Classes are extensional, properties not.
We have no clear basis in general for saying what coextensive proper­
ties qualify as identical and what ones do not. I n a word, properties lack
a clear principle of individuation. Groping for such as basis, one settles
for obscure talk of essence and necessity. Anything that can be described
in terms of properties and not equally directly i n terms of classes is un­
clear to my mind. I doubt that I have ever fully understood anything that
I could not explain in extensional language.
Now that I have slipped back into the first person, I shall continue in
that mode for a while; for the pertinent definitions are now explicitly be­
fore us. Afterward I shall resume the selfless business of making the
world safe for extensionalism.
My first i narticulate hint of extensional ism may date from boyhood,
when my liking for some Jewish schoolmates collided with someone's
occasional derogatory remark a bout Jews. I reasoned in effect that a
class is to be evaluated, if at all, by evaluating its members individually.
By my senior year in O berlin College, 1 929-1 9 3 0 , my extensionalism
was full blown. I was majoring i n mathematics with honors reading in

331

332

Q U I !': T E S S E !': C E

mathematical logic. There was little mathematical logic in America, and
none at Oberlin. But my professor, W. D . Cairns, had got me a reading
list, culminating in Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica.
My admiration for the three volumes, mostly in logical symbols, was
almost unbounded. There was the spectacular analysis, the reduction of
classical mathematics to a few basic notions of so-called logic, really
logic and set theory. Futther there was the rigor, explicitness, and clarity
of the definitions, theorems, and proofs.
My admiration was not quite unbounded. It was bounded by the ex­
planations in prose that were preposed and interposed as explanatory
chapters and i n briefer hits among the expanses of symbols.
Doubtful of the reality of classes, our authors undertook to accommo­
date them as fictions, el iminable by contextual definition i n terms of pur­
portedly more substantial things called propositional functions. These
were functions which, when applied to obj ects, yielded propositions,
which were the meanings of sentences. Thus the propositional functions
of one variable were evidently identifiable with properties, and those of
two or more variables were identifiable with relations " i n intension. "
Extensionality was seen by our authors as having to be worked for by
devious contextual definition. The illtentional, for all its failure of indi­
viduation, was the given. I suppose the reasoning was that, since the
propositions and propositional functions are the meanings of sentences,
adj ective phrases, and verb phrases, s urely they are clear to us insofar as
we understand the expressions whose meanings they are.
Tf so, the authors' fallacy lay i n tacitly taking in stride the giant step of
reifying those meanings. Reification incurs the responsibility to i ndividu­
ate the reified entities, for there is no entity without identity. I suspect
that our authors thus put undue weight on the adjective phrases that ex­
press the properties; for the phrases could differ conspicuously even i f
t h e properties did not.
Along with this regrettahly intentional orientation, but independent of
it, there was a detail that calls for notice only hecause of its dispropor­
tionate consequences in subsequent literature. The truth-functional con­
ditional " /, ::J q " or " not p or q " was called material implication in
Principia and read indifferently as " i f /' then q " and " p implies q . " On
the face of it th is was a grammatical aberration, independently of logical
considerations. 'rhe grammar of "if p then q " requires "P" and " q " to
stand for sentences, whereas that of " p implies q " requires them to stand
for nouns, in this case names of sentences.

Confessions of a Confirmed ExtenslOl1 a list

C . I. Lewis lashed out against material implication,' but his objection
was not to the grammar. I Ie was protesting, and rightly, that the truth
function " not-or " was a hollow mockery of implication, demanding as it
docs no semantic relevance of the one component sentence to the other.
He supplanted the weak " ::J " by a stronger connective " 3 " for what he
called strict implication. He explained " p -j q " as meaning " necessarily
if I) then q, " and offered no further reduction. It was an emphatic de­
parture from extensionalism, and it pioneered modal logic. Succeeding
modal logicians have not all persisted in the grammatical confusion he­
tween " if-then " and " implies , " but they still sacrifice extensi onality to
their " necessarily if-then. "
I find the truth-functional conditional " p ::J q " a satisfactory render­
ing of " if-then " in the indicative mood. Implication is quite another
thing, in strength as well as in grammar. It is a relation between sen­
tences, expressed by putting the verb " implies " between names of the
sentences, and it is established by steps of deduction.
Whitehead and Russell's regretta hle use of " implies " virtually spoiled
the word, prompting su bsequent logicians to cast about for synonyms
such as " entails " for the real thing. But I have been stubborn on that
point.
Unlike the enduring intentionality of modal logic, the intentional ity
of propositional functions in Prmcipia was mercifully just a flash in
the pan. The propositional functions carry over only briefly into the for­
mulas as values of quantified variables: only long enough to introduce
classes as fictions by contextual definition. From there on the construc­
tions proceed on greased wheels, greased by extensionality.
I was quite aware of these matters when I graduated from O berlin in
1 93 0 , hut my admiration for Pril1cil)ia was still almost unbounded. I
proceeded to Harvard for graduate work in philosophy because White­
head was in philosophy there . '\1y doctoral dissertation was in mathe­
matical logic still, under Whitehead's sponsorship, and was devoted to
improving PrinCIpia. lIe seemed tickled by my little shortcuts and clari­
fications, except that I cannot have swayed him in my extensionalism.
Anyway I imposed it in my dissertation. Individuals, classes, and se­
quences of them were all there was.
Mathematical logic, scarce in America, was sketchy even at Harvard.

Prillcipia was still the last word, and little was done even with it. I did
not know that in Poland, Germany, and Austria the suhj ect had heen
proceeding apace and that classes were the unquestioned staple from
scratch. [n J 93 1 , while [ wrote my dissertation, logicians in Europe were
freely pursuing logic and set theory on the frugal conceptual basis of j ust
truth functions, quantification, and memhership.
This startling economy came of Kazimierz Kuratowski's discovery
in 1 92 I that the ordered pair of x and y can be construed as the class
whose two members are the class of x alone and the class of x and y.
Kuratowski's definition had been a nticipated by a slightly less elegant
one in 1 9 1 4 by a young American, Norbert Wiener, but his three-page
paper in the Proceedings of the Cambridge [England] Philosophical
Society escaped notice everywhere. ' Both contributions, Wiener's and
Kuratowski's, escaped notice in America.
The economies over Principia that [ achieved in my dissertation had
thus been long surpassed, as r learned only after getting to Europe the
following year, 1 9 32, complete with doctorate . But in 1 93 7 I published a
more extreme reduction, assuming j ust class inclusion and class a bstrac­
tion.4
The reduction of classical mathematics to one or another so meager a
conceptual basis was amazing and illuminating, hut calling it a reduction
of mathematics to logic-logicism in a word-gave the wrong mes­
sage. Logic was proverhially slight and trivial. Mathematics proverbially
ranged from the profound to the impenetrable, and reduction of mathe­
matics to logic challenged belief, as indeed it well might. 'fhe reduction
was to the unbridled theory of classes, or set theory, which, far from be­
ing slight and trivial, is so strong as to tangle itself in paradox until bri­
dled in one way or another. This is no fault of extensionalism, be it
noted; properties are enmeshed in those paradoxes too. flut what it
shows is that the startling reduction of mathematics is to something far
richer than traditional logic. I prefer to limit the term " logic" to the logic
of truth functions, quantification, and identity, drawing the line at the
reification of classes. Above that line we have set theory, the mathemat­
ics of classes.

r think of logic in this narrow sense as the grammar of strictly scien­
tific theory. When a bit of science is thus regimented, the one place where
extra logical vocabulary enters the picture is as interpretation of the sche­
matic predicate l etters. Within this grammar, extensionality prevails.
But extensionality had no evident charm for the Harvard philosophers
during my two years of graduate study. Whitehead, Lewis, and Sheffer
all swore hy properties and propositions. It was with Carnap in Prague
and Tarski. Lesniewski, and Lukasiewicz in Warsaw the following year
that my extensionalism went without saying as a matter of course.
So much for reminiscence. But I have more to say of extensional ism,
for properties and necessity are not its only hurdles. The domain of
meanings of expressions is hopelessly intensional and in trouble over in­
dividuation. Propositions, seen as meanings of sentences, are conspicu­
ous here. Properties themselves might be seen correspondingly as mean­
ings of adj ective phrases.
Properties, meanings, and necessity were violations of extensional­
ity that r repudiated without regret. But the breach of extensionality
that I cited early in this essay is of another sort: "Tom helieves that
Cicero denounced Catiline . " Those idioms of propositional attitude­
belief, hope, regret, and the rest-are not to he lightly dismissed. It is not
clear how to do without them. But there is a strategy by which, in the
maj ority of cases, they can he rendered extensional.
r call it semantic ascent. It is the strategy of talking ahout expressions
instead of using those expressions to talk about something more dubi­
ous. It already did us routine service in correcting Whitehead and Rus­
sell's confused treatment of " implies" as a connective to be written be­
tween sentences. We lifted it to its rightful place as a transitive verb
between names of sentences. Now the strategy can be used also on as­
criptions of helief, artificially this time, hy reconstruing belief as a rela­
tion between believers and sentences: thus

Tom believes " Cicero denounced Catiline "
or perhaps, for usage sticklers,
Tom believes true " Cicero denounced Catilin e . "
This reinterpretation of the propositional attitudes, as relating the
person to the sentence, docs not require him to know the language.
The quoted sentence is the ascriber's expression of what he would he
prompted to assert if he were in the state of mind in which he takes the

335

336

Q U l i': T E S S E i': C E

subject to he. The effect of semantic ascent here is to seal the belief off
from the context in which it is ascribed, so that Tom's disbelief of " Tully
denounced Catiline " will not violate extensionality of the combined as­
criptions of helief and disbelief.
Some ascriptions of propositional attitudes resist semantic ascent. For
example,
There was an orator whom Tom believes to have denounced
Catiline.
This example switches us fwm what are called propositional attitudes de
dicta to attitudes de reo [n ascribing a belief de re the ascriber ventures to
assign a role within the ascribed belief to a denizen of the ascriber's real
world. Such identifications can depend in varying degrees upon collat­
eral information or conj ecture about the subj ect's past behavior. \ Seman­
tically these idioms de re of belief and other attitudes are comparable to
the contrary-to-fact conditional, which depends so utterly for its truth
upon tacit factual k nowledge or assumptions that the interlocutors are
assumed to share. The particles " y o u , " " I , " ""here," ''' there, '' ''' now, ''
and "then" are simpler examples of such dependence on circumstances
of utterance. So the propositional attitudes de re belong with these ex­
traneous idioms, ancillary to the self-contained language of scientific
record.
Finally J turn to some further thoughts about our extensionalizing
strategy of semantic ascent from use to mention. To the extensionalist
eye, the ascent could seem pa radoxically to be rather a descent from bad
to worse, from frying pan to fire. We mention expressions by quoting
them, and nothing could he less extensional on the face of it than quota­
tion. Within a quotation you cannot supplant a word by even the strict­
est synonym without changing the designatum of the quotation, namely
the quoted expression itself. Nothing could be farther from extension­
ality than quotation.
This quandary is dispelled by recognizing the quotation as merely
a graphic a bbreviation, analyzable into spelling. We possess or coin a
name for each of the simple signs of our language, and one for the space,
and one for the operation of juxtaposition. Then we spell out the quoted
expression. The spelling leaves no word of the quoted expression intact

for replacement by a synonym. It thus blocks this latest little dehacle he­
fore it begins.
Spelling is similar to polynomials and multi-digit numerals. It reduces
similarly to truth functions, quantification, and predicates, with the help
of contextual definition of singular description.
We have been seeing semantic ascent at work in achieving extension­
ality, hut it has other uses. Someone's revolutionary scientific idea may
prove difficult to promote because it undercuts one of the principles on
which his colleagues' very thought and j udgment depend. Holding that
principle at bay for impartial assessment leaves the judge himself at a
loss for a has is for j udging. Semantic ascent, then, to the rescue. The in­
novator ascends from his suhj ect matter to the formulas and laws them­
selves, dwells on their simplicity, and shows that they logically imply his
strange new hypothesis together with essentials of the antecedent the­
ory. The change of subj ect matter, from waves or quarks or fields to the
formulas themselves, has bridged the gaps in his colleagues' intuition.
Something like this perhaps went on at crucial points in the advance of
science, though with no awareness of an ascent from use to mentinn.

The incorrectness of rendering 'Ctesias i s hunting unicorns' i n the
fashion:
( 3 x ) (x is a unicorn . Ctesias is hunting x)
is conveniently attested hy the non-existence of unicorns, hut is not due
simply to that zoological lacuna. It would he equally incorrect to render
'Ernest is hunting lions' as:
(1)

(3x)(x i s a lion . Ernest is hunting x ) ,

where Ernest is a sportsman in Africa. The force of ( 1 ) is rather that
there is some individual lion (or several) which Ernest is hunting; stray
circus property, for example.
The contrast recurs in 'I want a sloop. ' The version:
(2)

( 3 x ) (x is a sloop . 1 want x )

is suitable insofar only as there may he s a i d to he a certain sloop that I
want. If what I seek is mere relief from slooplessness, then ( 2 ) gives the
wrong idea.
The contrast is that between what may be called the relational sense of
lion-hunting or sloop-wanting, viz., (1 )-( 2 ) , and the likelier or notional
sense. Appreciation of the difference is evinced in Latin and Romance
languages by a distinction of mood in suhordinate clauses; thus Trocuro
un /Jerro que habla ' has the relational sense:
( 3 x ) (x is a dog . x talks . 1 seek xl
338

Quantifiers a n d Propositional Attitudes

as against the notional 'Procuro un perro que hable ':
1 strive that ( 3 x ) ( x is a dog . x talks . I find x ) .

Pending considerations t o the contrary in later pages, w e m a y repre­
sent the contrast strikingly in terms of permutations of components.
Thus ( 1 ) and (2) may he expanded ( with some violence to both logic and
grammar ) as follows:
(3)

( 3 x ) ( x is a lion . Ernest strives that Ernest finds x ) ,

(4)

( 3 x ) ( x is a sloop . I w i s h t h a t I h a v e x ) ,

whereas 'Ernest is hunting lions' a n d ' I want a sloop' in their notional
senses may be rendered rather thus:
(S)

Ernest strives that ( 3 x ) ( x is a lion . Ernest finds x ) ,

(6)

I wish that ( 3 x ) ( x is a sloop . 1 have x ) .

The contrasting versions ( 3 )-( 6 ) have heen wrought b y s o paraphras­
ing 'hunt' and 'want' as to uncover the locutions 'strive that' and 'wish
that,' expressive of what Russell has called prot)()sitlOnal attitudes. Now
of all examples of propositional attitudes, the first and foremost is belief;
and, true to form, this example can be used to point up the contrast be­
tween relational and notional senses still hetter than ( 3 )-( 6 ) do. Con­
sider the relational and notional senses of helieving in spies:
(7)

( 3 x ) ( Ralph believes that x is a spy ) ,

(8)

Ralph believes that (3 x) (x is a spy ) .

Both m a y perhaps b e ambiguously phrased as 'Ralph believes that
someone is a spy,' but they may be unambiguously phrased respectively
as 'There is someone whom Ralph believes to he a spy' and ' Ralph he­
lieves there are spies . ' The difference is vast; indeed, if Ralph is like most
of us, ( 8 ) i s true and ( 7 ) false.
Tn moving over to propositional attitudes, as we did in ( 3 )-( 6 ) , we
gain not only the graphic structural contrast between ( 3 )-(4) and ( S )-( 6 )
but also a certain generality. For w e can now multiply examples of striv­
ing and wishing, unrelated to hunting and wanting. Thus we get the rela­
tional and notional senses of wishing for a president:
(9)

(3x) (Witold wishes that x i s president),

339

QUINTESSENCE

340

(10)

Witold wishes that ( 3 x ) ( x i s presiden t ) .

According to ( 9 ) , Witold has h i s candidate; according to ( 1 0 ) he merely
wishes the appropriate form of government were in force. Also we
open other propositional attitudes to similar consideration-as witness
( 7 ) -( 8 ) .
However, the suggested formulations o f the relational senses-viz.,
( 3 ) , (4), (7), and ( 9 )-all involve quantifying into a propositional-atti­
tude idiom fro m outside. This is a dubious business, as may be seen from
the following example.
There is a certain man in a brown hat whom Ralph has glimpsed sev­
eral times under questionable circumstances on which we need not enter
here; suffice it to say that Ralph suspects he is a spy. Also there is a gray­
haired man, vaguely known to Ralph as rather a pillar of the community,
whom Ralph is not aware of having seen except once at the beach. Now
Ralph docs not know it, bur the men are one and the same. Can we say
of this man ( Bernard J. Ortcutt, to give him a name) that Ralph believes
him to be a spy ? If so, we find ourselves accepting a conj unction of the
type :
(11)

w sincerely denies ' . . . ' . w believes that . . .

as true, with one and the same sentence in both blanks. For, Ralph is
ready enough to say, in all sincerity, 'Bernard J. Ortcutt is no spy. ' If, on
the other hand, with a view to disallowing situations of the type ( 1 1 ) , we
rule simultaneously that
( 12)

Ralph believes that the m a n in the brown hat is a spy,

(13)

Ralph does not believe that the man seen a t the beach i s a spy,

then we cease to affirm any relationship between Ralph and any man
at all. Both of the compooent 'that' -clauses are indeed about the man
Ortcutt; but the 'that' must be viewed in ( 1 2 ) and ( 1 3 ) as sealing those
clauses off, thereby rendering ( 1 2 ) and ( 1 3 ) compatible because not, as
wholes, about Ortcutt at all. It then becomes improper to quantify as in
( 7 ) ; 'believes that' becomes, in a word, referentially opaque . '
N o question arises over ( 8 ) ; it exhibits ooly a quantification within the
'believes that' context, not a quantification into it. What goes by the

board, when we rule ( 1 2 \ a n d ( 1 3 ) hoth true, is just ( 7 ) . Yet w e arc
scarcely prepared to sacrifice the relational construction 'There is some­
one whom Ralph believes to be a spy,' which (7) as against ( 8 ) was sup­
posed to rep rod uce.
The o bvious next move is to try to make the best of our dilemma by
distinguishing two senses of belief: belief" which disallows ( 1 1 ) , and
belief" which tolerates ( 1 1 ) but makes sense of ( 7 ) . For belief" accord­
ingly, we sustain ( 1 2 ) -( 13 ) and ban (7) as nonsense. For belief2, on the
other hand, we sustain ( 7 ) ; and for tlJls sense of helief we must rej ect ( 1 3 )
and acquiesce i n the conclusion that Ralph helieves, that the man a t the
beach is a spy even though he also believes, ( and believes t l that the man
at the beach is not a spy.
II

But there is a more suggestive treatment. Beginning with a single sense of
belief, viz., belieL above, let us think of this at first as a relation between
the believer and a certain intclIsitm, named by the 'that'-c1ause. Inten­
sions arc creatures of darkness, and I shall rejoice with the reader when
they are exorcised, hut first I want to make certain points with the help
of them. Now intensions named thus by 'that' -clauses, without free vari­
ables, I shall speak of more specifically as intensions o f degree 0, or
propositions. In addition I shall ( for the moment) recognize intensions of
degree 1 , or attributes. These are to he named by prefixing a variable to a
sentence in which it occurs free; thus z (z is a spy) is spyhood. Similarly
we may specify intensions of higher degrees by prefixing multiple vari­
ables.
Now j ust as we have recognized a dyadic relation of belief hetween a
believer and a proposition, thus:
( 14)

Ralph believes that O rtcutt is a spv,

so we may recognize also a triadic relation of belief among a believer, an
obj ect, and an attribute, thus:
(15)

Ralph believes z ( z is a spy) of Ortcutt.

For reasons which will appear, this is to he vi ewed not as dyadic belief
between Ralph and the proposition that Ortcutt has z ( z is a spy ) , but
rather as an irreducibly triadic relation among the three things Ralph,
z(z is a spy ) , and Ortcutt. Similarly there is tetradic belief:

34 1

QUINTESSENCE

342

( 16)

'Tom believes yz(y denounced z ) of Cicero and Catiline,

and so on.
Now we can clap on a hard and fast rule against quantifying into
propositional-attitude idioms; but we give it the form now of a rule
against quantifying into names of intensions. Thus, though (7) as it
stands becomes unallowable, we can meet the needs which prompted (7)
by quantifying rather into the triadic belief construction, thus:
( 1 7)

( 3x ) ( Ralph believes z(z is a spy ) of x ) .

Here then, in place of ( 7 ) , i s o u r n e w w a y of saying that there is someone
whom Ralph believes to be a spy.
Belief, was belief so construed that a proposition might be believed
when an object was specified in it in one way, and yet not believed when
the same object was specified in another way; witness ( 1 2 )-( 1 3 ) . Hereaf­
ter we can adhere uniformly to this narrow sense of belief, both for the
dyadic case and for triadic and higher; in each case the term which
names the i ntension (whether proposition or attribute or intension of
higher degree) is to be looked on as referentially opaque.
The situation ( I I ) is thus excluded. At the same time the effect of
belief! can be gained, simply by ascending from dyadic to triadic belief as
in ( 1 5 ) . For ( I S ) does relate the men Ralph and Ortcutt precisely as
belief, was intended to do. ( 1 5 ) does remain true o f O rtcutt under any
designation; and hence the legitimacy of ( 1 7) .
Similarly, whereas from:
'Tom believes that Cicero denounced Catiline
we cannot conclude:
Tom believes that Tully denounced Catiline,
on the other hand we can conclude from:
Tom believes y ( y denounced Catiline) of Cicero
that
Tom believes y(y denounced Catiline) of Tully,
and also that
( 1 8)

( 3 x) (Tom believes y(y denounced Catiline ) of x ) .

Quantifiers and Propositional Attitudes

From ( 1 6 ) , similarly, we may infer that
(19)

( 3 tv) (3x) (Tom believes yz( y denounced z ) o f tv and x ) .

Such quantifications as:
( 3 x ) ( To m believes that x denounced Catiline ) ,
( 3 x ) ( Tom believes y ( y denounced x ) of Cicero )
still count as nonsense, along with ( 7 ) ; but such legitimate purposes as
these might have served are served by ( 1 7)-( 1 9 ) and the like. Our names
of intensions, and these only, are what count as referentially opaque.
Let us sum up our findings concerning the seven numbered statements
about Ralph. ( 7 ) is now counted as nonsense, ( 8 ) as trne, ( 1 2 )-( 1 3 ) as
true, ( 1 4 ) as false, and ( 1 5 ) and ( 1 7) as true. Another that is true is:
(20)

Ralph believes that the man seen at the beach is not a spy,

which of course must not be confused with ( 1 3 ) .
The kind o f exportation which leads from ( 1 4 ) t o ( 1 5 ) should doubt­
less be viewed in general as implicative . [Correction: see Sleigh, p. 3 97. J
Under the terms of our illustrative story, ( 1 4 ) happens to be false; but
( 2 0 ) is true, and it leads by exportation to:
(2 1 )

Ralph believes z(z is not a spy) of the man seen at the beach.

The man at the beach, hence Ortcutt, does not receive reference in ( 2 0 ) ,
because of referential opacity; but he does in ( 2 1 ) , so w e m a y conclude
from ( 2 1 ) that
(22 )

Ralph believes z(z is not a spy) of Ortcutr.

Thus ( 1 5 ) and ( 2 2 ) both count as true. This is not, however, to charge
Ralph with contradictory beliefs . Such a charge might reasonably be
read into:
(23)

Ralph believes z(z is a spy .

Z

is not a spy) of Ortcutt,

but this merely goes to show that it is undesirable to look upon ( 1 5 ) and
( 2 2 ) as implying ( 2 3 ) .
f t hardly needs be said that the barbarous usage illustrated in ( 1 5 )­
( 1 9 ) and ( 2 1 )-( 2 3 ) is not urged as a practical reform. It is put forward
by way of straightening out a theoretical difficulty, which, summed up,
was as follows: Belief contexts arc referentially opaque; therefore it is

343

344

Q U I :"J T E S S F :"J C E

prima facie meaningless to quantify into them; how then to provide for
those indispensable relational statements of belief, like 'There is some­
one whom Ralph believes to be a spy ' ?
Let i t n o t be supposed that t h e theory which w e have been examining
is j ust a matter of allowing unbridled quantification into belief contexts
after all, with a legalistic change of notation. On the contrary, the crucial
choice recurs at each point: quantify if you will, but pay the price of ac­
cepting near-contraries like ( 1 5 ) and ( 2 2 ) at each point at which you
choose to quantify. I n other words: distinguish as you please between
referential and non-referential positions, but keep track, so as to treat
each kind appropriately. The notation of intensions, of degree one and
higher, is in effect a device for inking in a boundary between referential
and non-referential occurrences of terms.
III

Striving and wishing, like helieving, are propositional attitudes and ref­
erentially opaque. ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are obj ectionable in the same way as ( 7 ) ,
and o u r recent treatment o f belief c a n be repeated for these proposi­
tional attitudes. Thus, j ust as (7) gave way to ( 1 7) , so ( 3 ) and (4) give
way to:
(24 )

( 3 x ) ( x is a l i on . Ernest strives z( Ernest fi n d s z) of x ) ,

(25)

( 3x(x is a sloop . I wish z( I have z) of x ) ,

a certain breach of idiom heing allowed for t h e s a k e of analogy in the
case of 'strives.'
These examples came from a study of hunting and wanting. O bserv­
ing in ( 3 )-(4) the quantification into opaque contexts, then, we might
h ave retreated to ( I )-( 2 ) and forhorne to paraphrase them into terms of
striving and wishing. for (1 )-( 2 ) were quite straightforward renderings
of lion-hunting and sloop-wanting in their relational senses; it was only
the notional senses that really needed the hreakdown into terms of striv­
ing and wishing, ( 5 )-( 6 ) .
Actually, though, i t would b e myopic t o leave the relational senses of
lion-hunting and sloop-wanting at the unanalyzed stage ( 1 )-( 2 ) . For,
whether or not we choose to put these over into terms of wishing and
striving, there are other relational cases of wishing and striving which re­
quire our consideration anyway-as witness ( 9 ) . The untenable formula-

QUdlltIfiers and Propu:)itJonal A ttitudes

tions ( 3 )-( 4 ) may indeed he either corrected as (24)-( 2 5 ) or condensed
back into (1 )-( 2 ) ; on the other hand we have no choice but to correct the
untenahle ( 9 ) on the pattern of (24)-( 2 5 ) , viz., as:
(3x) (Witold wishes y(y is president) of x ) .
The unteoahle versions ( 3 )-( 4 ) and ( 9 ) a l l h a d t o do with wishing and
striving in the relational sense. We see in contrast that ( 5 )-( 6 ) a n d ( 1 0 ) ,
on t h e notional s i d e of wishing and striving, a r e innocent of a n y illicit
quantification into opaque contexts from outside. But now notice that
exactly the same trouble begins also on the notional side, as soon as we
try to say not j ust that Ernest hunts lions and I want a sloop, but that
someone hunts lions or wants a sloop. This move carries us, ostensi hly,
from ( 5 )-( 6 ) to:
(26)

( 3 w ) ( w strives that ( 3 x ) ( x is a lion . w finds x l ) ,

(27)

( 3 w ) ( w wishes that ( 3 x ) ( x is a sloop . w h a s x ) ) ,

a n d these do quantify una llowably into opaque contexts.
We know how, with help of the attrihute apparatus, to put ( 2 6 )-( 2 7 )
in order; t h e pattern, indeed, is su bstantiallv before us in (24)-( 2 5 ) . Ad­
missible versions arc:
( 3 w ) ( w strives y ( 3 x ) ( x is a lion . y fi n d s x) of w i ,
(3w)(w wishes y ( 3 x ) ( x is a sloop . y h a s x ) of w ) ,
or briefly:
(28)

( 3 W ) ( 1l" strives y(y finds a lion) of w I ,

(29)

( 3 w ) ( w wishes y ( y h a s a sloop) of w I .

Such quantification of the suhject of t h e propositional attitude c a n o f
course occur in helief as well; a n d , if the subject is mentioned in the be­
lief itself, the ahove pattern is the one to use. Thus 'Someone believes he
is Napoleo n ' must be rendered:
( 3 w ) ( w helieves y ( y

=

Napoleon) of w I .

F o r concreteness I have been discussing belief primarily, a n d two oth er
propositional attitudes secondarily: striving and wishing. The treatment
is, we see, closely parallel for the three; and It will pretty evidently carry
over to other propositional attitudes as well-e.g., hope, fear, surprise.

345

346

QUINTESSENCE

In all cases my concern is, of course, with a special technical aspect of the
propositional attitudes: the problem of quantifying in.
IV

There are good reasons for being d iscontent with an analysis that leaves
us with propositions, attributes, and the rest of the intensions. Intensions
are less economical than extensions ( truth values, classes, relations ) , in
that they are more narrowly individuated. The principle of their individ­
uation, moreover, is o hscure.
Commonly logical equivalence is adopted as the principle of individu­
ation of intensions. More explicitly: if S and S ' are any two sentences
with 11 ( � O ) free variables, the same in each, then the respective inten­
sions which we name by putting the Il variables (or 'that,' if n = 0) be­
fore S and S' shall be one and the same i ntension if and only if S and S'
are logically equivalent. But the relevant concept of logical equivalence
raises serious questions in turn.' The intensions are at best a pretty ob­
scure lot.
Yet it is evident enough that we cannot, in the foregoing treatment of
propositional attitudes, drop the intensions in favor of the correspond­
ing extensions. Thus, to take a trivial example, consider 'w is hunting
unicorn s . ' O n the analogy of ( 2 8 ) , it becomes:
w strives y (y finds a unicorn ) of w.
Correspondingly for the hunting of griffins. Hence, if anyone w is to
hunt unicorns without hunting griffins, the attributes
y(y finds a unicorn ) ,
y(y finds a griffi n )
m u s t be distinct. B u t t h e corresponding classes are identical, being
empty. So it is indeed the attributes, and not the classes, that were needed
in our formulation. The same moral could be drawn, though less briefly,
without appeal to empty cases.
But there is a way of dodging the intensions which merits serious con­
sideration . Instead of speaking of intensions we can speak of sentences,
naming these by quotation. Instead of:
w believes that . . .
2 . See my "Two Dogmas " [Chapter 2J; also " Ca nu p and Logical Truth " rChap·
ter 41.

Q ua n t i fiers and Propositional Attitudes

we may say:
w

believes-true ' . . . ' .

Instead of:
(30)

w

believes y( . . . y . . . ) of x

we may say:
(3 1 )

w

believes ' . . . y . .

o'

satisfied by x .

T h e words 'believes satisfied b y ' here, l i k e ' believes of' before, would b e
viewed as an irreducibly triadic predicate. A similar shift can be made
in the case of the other propositional attitudes, of course, and in the
tetradic and higher cases.
This semantical reformulation is not, of course, intended to suggest
that the subj ect of the propositional attitude speaks the language of the
quotation, or any language. We may treat a mouse's fear of a cat as his
fearing true a certain English sentence. This is unnatural without being
therefore wrong. It is a little like describing a prehistoric ocean current
as clockwise.
How, where, and on what grounds to draw a boundary between those
who believe or wish or strive that I) , and those who do not quite believe
or wish or strive that p, is undeniably a vague and obscute affair. How­
ever, if anyone does approve of speaking of helief of a proposition at all
and of speak ing of a proposition in turn as meant by a sentence, then
certainly he cannot obj ect to our semantical reformulation ' w believes­
true S' on any special grounds of obscurity; for, ' w believes-true S' is ex­
plicitly definable in his terms as ' w believes the proposition meant by S o '
Similarly f o r t h e seman tical reformulation ( 3 1 ) of ( 3 0 ) ; similarly f o r the
tetradic and higher cases; and similarly for wishing, striving, and other
propositional attitudes.
Our semantical versions do involve a relativity to language, however,
which must be made explicit. When we say that w believes-true S, we
need to be able to say what language the sentence S is thought of as be­
longing to; not because w needs to understand S, but because S might by
coincidence exist ( a s a linguistic form) with very different meanings in
two languages. ' Strictly, therefore, we should think of the dyadic 'be3. ThIs POlOt IS made by Church, "On Carnap's AnalysIs of Statements of Asser­

348

lieves-true S' as expanded to a triadic ' w believes-true S in V; and corre­
spondingly for ( 3 1 ) and its suite.
As noted two paragraphs back, the semantical form of expression:
(32)

w

believes-true ' . . . ' in L

can be explained in intensional terms, for persons who favor them, as:
(33)

w

believes the proposition meant by ' . . . ' in L ,

thus leaving no cause for protest on the score of relative clarity. Protest
may still be heard, however, on a different score : ( 3 2 ) and ( 3 3 ) , though
equivalent to each other, arc not strictly equivalent to the ' w believes
that . . . ' which is our real concern. For, it is argued, in order to infer ( 3 3 )
w e need not only the information about w which ' w believes that . . . '
provides, b u t also some extraneous information about the language L .
Church4 brings the point out by appeal to translations, su hstantially as
follows. The respective statements:
w

believes that there are unicorns,

w believes the proposition meant by 'There are unicorns' in
English

go into German as:
glaubt, dass e s Fmhome gibt,

(34)

w

( 3 .5 )

w glauht diclcl1ige A ussage, die There are unicorn s " auf
"
El1glisch bedeutet,

and clearly ( 3 4 ) d oes not provide enough information to enable a Ger­
man ignorant of English to infer ( 3 .5 ) .
The same reasoning can b e used t o show that 'There are unicorns' i s
not strictly or analytically equivalent to:
'There are unicorns' is true in English.
Nor, indeed, was Tarski's truth paradigm intended to assert analytic
equivalence. Similarly, then, for ( 3 2 ) in relation to ' w believes that . . .'; a
systematic agreement in truth value can be claimed, and no more. This
limitation will prove of little moment to persons who share my skepti­
cism about analyticity.

What I find more disturbing about the semantical versions, such as
( 3 2 ) , is the need of dragging in the language concept at all. What is a lan­
guage ? What degree of fixity is supposed ? When do we have one lan­
guage and not two ? The propositional attitudes are dim affairs to begin
with, and it is a pity to have to add obscurity to obscurity by bringing in
l a nguage variables too. Only let it not be supposed that any clarity is
gained by restituting the intensions.

F o r the necessity predicate, as distinct from the necessity functor ' 0 ' , I
shall write 'Nec . ' I affirm it of a sentence, to mean that the sentence is
a necessary truth, or, if one like, analytic. Whatever its shortcomings
in respect of clear criteria, the predicate is more comfortahle than the
sentence functor, for it occasions no departure from extensional logic.
Hence there would he comfort in heing ahle to regard '0' as mere short­
hand for 'Nec' and a pair of quotation marks-thus ' 0 ( 9 is odd ) ' for
' Nec '9 is odd'.' But it will not do. In modal logic one wants to quantify
into necessity contexts, and we cannot quantify into quotations.
We can adjust matters by giving 'Nec' multigrade status: ' letting it
figure as an n-place predicate for each 11 . As a two-place predicate it
amounts to the words 'is necessarily true of'; thus Nec ( 'odd,' 9). As a
three-place predicate it amounts to those same words said of a two-place
predicate and two objects; thus Nec ( ' < ', 5, 9 ) . And so on up. Tn terms
now of multigrade 'Nee' we can explain the use of '0' on open sen­
tences. We can explain 'O(x is odd),' 'O(x < y ) , ' etc., as short for 'Nee
( 'odd,' x ) , ' 'Nee ( ' < ', x, y ) , ' etc.' There is no longer an obstacle to quan­
tifying into 'O(x is odd),' 'O(x < y ) , ' etc. since the dehnientia do not
quote the variables.
This multigrade use of 'Nee' is much like my multigrade treatment in

Revisited

adoption of a multigrade predicate involves no logical anomaly or any
infinite lexicon. It can be viewed as a one-place predicate whose argu­
ments are sequences. As for the usc of quotation, it of course is reducible
by inductive definition to the concatenation functor and names of sign>.
Perhaps also a caution is in order regarding two ways of taking 'neces­
sarily true. ' The sentence ' 9 is odd' is a necessary truth; still, that the
form of words ' 9 is o d d ' means what it does, and is thus true at all, i s
o n l y a contingent fact of social usage. O f course I intend 'Nee' in t h e for­
mer way. Si milarly for its polyadic use, applied to predicates.
Commonly the predicate wanted as argument of 'Nee' will not be
available in the language as a separate word or consecutive phrase. At
that point the 'such that' functor serves. For example, the definiens of
' O ( l x + y ) l x - y ) = x' - y ' ) ' is:
Nec l 'zw 3 ( (z

+

w ) ( z - w) = z ' -

w' ) , '

x , y).

The 'such that' functor, 'zw in this example, connotes no abstraction
of classes or rclations or attributes. It is only a device fo r fo rming com­
plex predicates, tantamount to relative clauses . '
When predication in the mode of necessity is di rected upon a variable,
the necessity is de re: the predicate is meant to be true of the value of
the varia hie by whatever name, there being indeed no name at hand.
'Nec('odd,' x ) ' says of the unspecified obj ect x that oddity is of its es­
sence. Thus it is true not only that Nec('odd,' 9), but equally that
Nec('odd,' number of planets ) , since this very object 9, essence and all,
happens to be the number of the planets. The 'Nec' notation accommo­
dates de dieto necessity too, but differently: the term concerned de dlcto
is within the quoted sentence or predicate. Thus ' Nee ' 9 is odd", unl ike
'Nec( 'odd,' 9),' is de dieto, and 'Nec 'number of planets is odd", unlike
'Nec ( 'odd,' number of planets ) , ' is false.
De re and de dicto can be distinguished also in terms of ' 0 ' , but along
other lines. When the term concerned is a varia ble, there is nothing to
distinguish; de re is de rigueur. When it is not a variable, we keep it in the
scope of '0 ' for de dicto:
LJ ( numher of planets is odd )

( false)

and bring it out thus for de re:

QUINTESSENCE

In the system of definitions of ' 0 ' in terms of 'Nee' we observe a radical
twist: 'O(x is odd ) ' and ' O ( number of planets is odd ) ' look alike i n form,
as do 'Nee ( 'odd; x ) ' and 'Nec('odd,' number of planets) , ' but the trans­
lations do not run true to form. '[J(x is odd ) ' and ' [] ( number of planets
is odd ) ' stand rather fo r the dissimilar formulas 'Nee( 'odd; x)' and 'Nee
'number of planets is odd", whereas what stands for 'Nec ( 'odd,' n umber
of planets ) ' is ( 1 ) .
Definitional expansion o f ' 0' thus goes awry under substitution of
constants for variables. This is legitimate; unique climinability is the
only formal demand on definition. What the i rregularity docs portend is
a drastic difference in form between the modal logic of ' 0 ' and such laws
as govern its defining predicate 'Nec . ' Drastic difference there is indeed.
In particular the distinction between de re and de dictn is drawn with a
simpler uniformity in terms of 'Nec' than in terms of ' 0 ' .
Some simplification of theory c a n be gained by dispensing with singu­
lar terms other than varia hIes in familiar fashion: primitive names can be
dropped in favor of uniquely fulfilled predicates and then restored as sin­
gular descriptions, which finally can be defined away in essentially Rus­
sell's way. That done, we can explain '0' fully in terms of 'Nee' and vice
versa by this schematic biconditional:
(2)

OFX,X, . . . x "

==

Nec( ' F ' , x " x" . . . , x,,) .

Here n may b e O . A certain liberty has been taken in quoting a schematic
letter.
lt may be noted in passing that '0' on the left of (2) could alternatively
be viewed not as a sentence functor but as a predicate functor, governing
j ust the '1" and forming a modal predicate 'OF ' . '
The reconstruction of ' 0 ' in terms of 'Nec' has lent some clarity to the
foundations of modal logic by embedding it in extensional logic, quota­
tion, and a special predicate. Incidentally the contrast between de re and
de dicto has thereby been heightened. But the special predicate takes
some swallowing. Tn its monadic use it is at best the controversial seman­
tic predicate of analyticity, and in its polyadic use it imposes an essen­
tialist metaphysics. Let me be read, then, as expounding rather than pro­
pounding. I am in the position of a Jewish chef preparing ham for a
gentile clientele. Analyticity, essence, and modality arc not my meat.

If these somber reflections make one wonder whether 'Nec' may be
more than we need for '0', a negative answer is visible in ( 2 ) : they are
i nterdefina ble.'
A project that I shall not undertake is that of codifying laws of 'Nec'
from which those of modal logic can be derived through the definitions.
The laws of 'Nec' would involve continual interplay between quotations
and their contents. O hviously we would want:
Nee . . . ' ::J . . . ,
'

where the dots stand for any closed sentence. Also, where '
' and
' . . .' stand for any closed sentences, we would want 'Nec '
== . . . " to
assure the interchangea bility of '
' with ' . . . ' inside any quotation
preceded by 'Nec . ' This is needed for the substitutivity of ' 0 (
==
. . . j' in the modal logic. Also we would need corresponding laws gov­
erning the polyadic use of 'Nec' in application to predicates; and here
complexities mount. No dou bt modal logic is better codified in its own
terms; such is the very utility of defining ' 0 ' instead of staying with
'Nee.' The latter is merely of conceptual interest in distilling the net im­
port of modcl i logic over and above extensional logic.
Necessity de dicto is notoriously resistant to the substitutivity of iden­
tity. When only variables are concerned, the question does not arise;
for the\' figure only de re, or, as I have often put it, only in referential po­
sition. Moreover, we have decided that only variables are concerned,
definitions aside. Still, let us consider how singular terms fare when re­
stored definition ally as descriptions. Expanded by those definitions, an
identity j oining two descriptions or a description and a variable obvi­
ousl\' implies the corresponding universally quantified biconditional. We
may be sure therefore that even in de dicto positions, where substitu­
tivity of simple identity fails, we can depend on substitutivity of neces­
sary identity, 0 ( 1; = rJ ) ; t h i s is assured by t h e substitutivity of ' 0 (
==
. . . ) ' noted above.
The su bstitutivity of '0(1; = rJ ) ' is gospel in modal logic. Still, some
readers are perhaps brought up short by my appeal to '0(1;
rJ ) " as if I

Instantiation of quantification by singular terms is under the same wraps
as the su bstitutivity of identity.
Let instantiation then be our next topic. From the true universal quan­
tification:
( x ) (x is a number .

�

. [ 1(5 < x)

V

0(5 � x))

w e cannot, o n e hopes, infer the falsehood:
0(5 < number of planets)

V

0(5 � number of planets ) .

From the truth:
5 < number of planets .

-

015 < number of planets ) ,

again, we cannot, one hopes, infer t h e falsehood:
( 3x ) ( 5 < x . - U(5 < x ) ) .
When cal1 w e trust the instantial laws of quantification ? The answer
is implicit in the substitutivity of ' D I C = 'I ) '. For, instantiation is un­
questioned when the instantial term is a mere variable 'x'; and we can
supplant 'x' here by any desired term 1] , thanks to the substitutivity of
' D ( x = 1] ) if we can establish ' ( 3x ) D (x = 1] ) '. This last, then, is the con­
dition that qualifies a term 'I for the instantial role in steps of universal
instantiation and existential generalization in modal contexts. A term
thus qualified is what F0llesdal called a genuine name and Kripke has
called a rigid designator.' It is a term such that ( 3 x ) D (x = a), that is,
something is necessarily a, where ' a' stands for the term.
Such a term enjoys de re privileges even in a de dicta setting. Besides
acquitting themselves in instantiation, such terms lend themselves in
pairs to the su bstitutivity of simple identity. For, where C and 1] are rigid
designators, we are free to put them for 'x' and 'y' in ( 3 ) and thus derive
necessary identity.
A rigid designator differs from others in that it picks out its object by
essential traits. It designates the object in all possible worlds in which it
exists. Talk of possible worlds is a graphic way of waging the essentialist
philosophy, but it is only that; it is not an explication. Essence is needed
to identify an obj ect from one possible world to another.
Let us turn now to the propositional attitudes. As remarked above, my

treatment of them in 1 95 6 resembled my present use of 'Nec . ' A t that
time I provisionally invoked attributes and propositions, however re­
luctantly, for the roles here played by mere predicates and sentences.
Switching now to the latter style, I would write:
(4)

Tom believes 'Cicero denounced Catiline,'

(5)

Tom believes 'x

(6)

Tom believes ' x 3 ( Cicero denounced x ) ' of Catiline,

(7)

Tom believes 'xy 3 (x denounced y ) ' of Cicero, Catiline,

3

(x denounced Catiline ) ' of Cicero,

depending on which terms I want in referential position-that is, with
respect to which terms I want the belief to be de reo The multigrade pred­
icate 'believes' in these examples is dyadic, triadic, triadic, and tetradic.
Whatever the obscurities of the notion of belief, the underlying logic
thus far is extensional-as in the case of 'Nee. ' B u t w e c a n immediately
convert the whole to a n intensional logic of belief, analogous to that of
'0', Where 'B,' is a sentence functor ascribing belief to Tom, the ana­
logue of the sketchy translation schema (2) is this:

Parallel to ( 1 ) we get:
(3x)(x

=

Cicero . B , ( x denounced Catiline ) ) ,

I n t h e 1 95 6 paper I dwelt on the practical difference between the de

Ralph believes ' ( 3 x ) ( x is a spy ) '

and the d e r c statement 'There is someone whom Ralph believes to b e a
spy,' that is:
(9)

( 3y ) ( Ralph believes 'spy' of y).

I noted also the more narrowly logical difference between the de dicto
statement:

Q U I NTESSENCE

(10)

Ralph believes 'Ortcut! is a spy'

a n d the de re statement:
(11)

Ralph believes 'spy' o f Ortcutt,

and conj ectured that the step of 'exportatio n ' leading from ( 1 0 ) to ( 1 1 ) is
generally valid. However, if we transcribe ( 1 0 ) and ( 1 1 ) into terms of 'B,'
according to the foregoing patterns, we get:
( 12)

B,( Ortcutt i s a spy ) ,

(13)

(3x)(x

=

Ortcutt . B,(x is a spy ) ) ,

a n d here the existential force of ( 1 3 ) would seem to belie the validity
of the exportatio n . Sleigh, moreover, has challenged this step on other
grounds. Surely, he observes ( nearly enough ) , Ralph believes therc are
spies. If he believes further, as he reasonably may, that
( 14)

No two spies are of exactly thc same height,

then he will believe that the shortest spy is a spy. I f exportation were
valid, it would follow that
Ralph believes 'spy' of the sho rtest spy,
and this, having the term 'the shortest spy' out in referential position,
implies ( 9 ) . Thus the portentous belief ( 9 ) would follow from trivial
ones, ( 8 ) and belief of ( 1 4 ) .
Let us consult i ncidentally the analogues of ( 1 0 ) and ( 1 1 ) i n modal
logic. Looking to the transcriptions ( 1 2 ) and ( 1 3 ) , we see that the analo­
gous modal structures are ' O Fa' and ' ( 3x ) (x = a . O Fx ) , ' Does the onc
imply the other ? Again the existential force of the latter would suggest
not. And again we can dispute the implication also apart from that exis­
tential consideration, as follows [abbreviating ( 1 4 ) and 'there arc spies'
i n conj u nction as ' 1 4' ] :
(15)

0 ( 1 4 :J . the shortest spy is a spy ) ,

( 1 6)

(3x)(x

=

the shortest spy . 0 ( 1 4 :J . x is a spy ) ) .

Surely ( 1 5 ) i s true. O n the other hand, granted ( 1 4 ) , presumably ( 1 6 ) is
false; for it would requirc someone to be a spy de re, or i n essencc.
Evidently we must find against exportatio n . Kaplan's j ndgmcnt, which
he credits to Montgomery Furth, is that the step is sound only i n the case

Intcn�1011S RevIsited

of what he calls a vivid designator, which is the analogue in the logic of
belief, of a rigid designator. And what might this analogue b e ? We saw
that i n modal logic a term is a rigid designator if ( 3 x l [" I (x ai, where 'a '
stands for the term; so the parallel condition for the logic of belief is that
( 3 x I B,(x = ai, i f Tom is our man. Thus a term is a vivid designator, for
Tom, when there is a specific thing that he believes it designates. Vivid
designators, analogues of the rigid designators in modal logic, are the
terms that can be freely used to instantiate quantifications in belief con­
texts, and that are subject to the substitutivity of identity and, now, to
exportation.
Hintikka's criterion for this superior type of term was that Tom kl10w
who or what the person or thing is; whom or what the term designates.s
The difference is accountable to the fact that lIintikka's was a logic of
both belief and knowledge.
The notion of knowing or believing who or what someone or some­
thing is, is utterly dependent on context. Sometimes, when we ask who
someone is, we see the face and want the name; sometimes the reverse .
Sometimes we want to know his role in the community." Of itself the no
tion is empty.
It and the notion of essence are on a par. Both make sense in context.
Relative to a particular inquiry, some predicates may play a more basic
role than others, or may apply more fixedly; and these may be treated as
essential. The respective derivative notions, then, of vivid designator and
rigid designator, are similarly dependent o n context and empty other­
wise. The same is true of the whole quantified modal logic of necessity;
for it collapses if essence is withdrawn. For that matter, the very notion
of necessity makes sense to me only relative to context. Typicallv it is ap­
plied to what is assumed in an inquiry, as against what has yet to tran­
spire.
In thus writing off modal logic I find little to regret. Regarding the
propositional attitudes, however, 1 cannot be so cavalier. Where does the
passing of the vivid designator leave us with respect to helief? It leaves us
with no distinction between admissihle and inadmissible cases of the ex­
portation that leads from ( 1 0 ) to ( 1 1 I , except that those cases remain in,

admissible in which the exported term fails to name anything. It leaves
us defenseless against Sleigh's deduction of the strong ( 9 ) from ( 8 ) and
belief of ( 1 4 ) . Thus i t virtually annuls the seemingly vital contrast be­
tween ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) : between merely believing there are spies and suspect­
ing a specific person. At first this seems intolerable, but it grows on one. I
now think the distinction is every bit as empty, apart from context, as
that of vivid designator: that of knowing or believing who someone is. In
context it can still be important. In one case we can be of service by
pointing out the suspect; in another, by naming h im; in others, by giving
his address or specifying his ostensihle employment.
Renunciation does not stop here. The condition for being a vivid des­
ignator is that ( 3 x ) B,(x = a), or, in the other notation, that
1 3 x ) ( Tom believes 'y

3

(y

=

a ) ' of x ) .

Surely this makes every b i t as good sense as the idiom 'believes of'; there
can be no trouble over ' y 3 (y = a ) . ' So our renunciation must extend
to all de re belief, and similarly, n o doubt, for the other propositional
attitudes. We end up rejecting de re or quantified propositional atti­
tudes generally, on a par with de re or quantified modal logic. Rejecting
them, that is, except as idioms relativized to the context or situation at
hand. We remain less cavalier toward propositional attitudes than to­
ward modal logic only in the unquantified or de dicto case, where the at­
titudes are taken as dyadic relations between people or other animals
and closed sentences.
Even these relations present difficulties in respect of criterion. Belief is
not to be recognized simply by assent, for this leaves no place for insin­
cerity or sanctimonious self-deception. Belief can be nicely tested and
even measured by the betting odds that the subj ect will accept, allow­
ance being made for the positive or negative value for him of risk as
such. This allowance can be measured by testing him on even chances .
However, bets work only for sentences for which there is a verification
or falsification procedure acceptable to both parties as settling the bet. I
see the verb 'believe' even in its de dicto use as varying in meaningfulness
from sentence to sentence.
Ascribed to the dumb and illiterate animal, belief de dicto seems a
contradictio in adjecto. The betting test is never available. I have sug­
gested elsewhere that some propositional attitudes-desire, fear-might
be construed as a relation of the animal to a set of sets of his sensory re-

Intensions Revisited

ceptors; but this works only for what I called egocentric desire and fear. !"
I see no way of extending this to belief. Certainly the ascription of a spe­
cific simple belief to a dumb animal often can be supported hy citing
its observable behavior; but a general definition to the purpose is not
evident.
Raymond Nelson has ascribed beliefs to machines. He has done so in
support of a mechanist philosophy, and I share his attitude. The obj ects
of belief with which he deals are discrete, o bservable alternatives, and
the machine's belief or expectation with respect to them lends itself to a
straightforward definition. But this is of no evident help in the kind of
problem that is exercising me here. For my problem is not one of recon­
ciling mind and matter, hut o nly a quest for general criteria suitable for
unprefabricated cases.

O n e of the fundamental principles governing identity i s that of substi­
tutivity-or, as it might well be called, that of illdiscernibility of identi­
cals. It provides that, gIVen a true statement of identity, one of its two
terms may he substituted (or the other In any true statement and the re­
sult will be true. [t is easy to find cases contrary to this principle. For ex­
ample, the statements:
(1)

Giorgione

(2)

Giorgione w a s so-called because of h i s size

=

Barharelli,

are true; however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' hy the name
'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood :
Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.
Furthermore, the statements:
(3)

Cicero

(4)

'Cicero' contains si x letters

=

'fully,

are true, but replacement of the first name by the second turns ( 4 ) false.
Yet the basis of the principle of substitutivity appears quite solid; what­
ever can be said about the person Cicero (or Giorgione) should be
equally true of the person Tully ( o r Barbarelli ) , this being the same
person.
In the case of (4), this paradox resolves itself immediately. The fact is
that (4) is not a statement about the person Cicero, but simply about the
360

Reference

a n d iV! od a b t y

word 'Cicero . ' The principle of ,ubstitutivity should not be extended to
contexts i n which the name to be supplanted occurs without referring
simply to the obj ect. Failure of substitutivity reveals merely that the oc­
currence to be supplanted is not purely referential, I that is, that the state­
ment depends not only on the object but on the form of the name. ror it
is clear that whatever can be affirmed about the object remains true
when we refer to the obj ect bv any other name.
An expression which consists of another expression between single
quotes constitutes a name o f that other expression; and it is clear that the
occurrence of that other expression or a part of it, within the context of
quotes, is not in general referential. I n particular, the occurrence of the
personal name within the context of quotes in ( 4 ) is not referential, not
subj ect to the substitutivity principl e . The personal name occurs there
merely as a fragment of a longer name which contains, hcside this frag­
ment, the two quotation marks. To make a substitution upon a personal
name, within such a context, would be no more j ustifiable than to make
a substitution upon the term 'cat' within the context 'catrle."
The example (2) is a little more su btle, for it is a statement about a
man and not merely about his name. It was the man, n ot his name, that
was called so and so because of his size. Nevertheless, the failure of
substitutivity shows that the occurrence of the person a l name in ( 2 ) is
not purely referential. It is easy i n fact to translate (2) into another state­
ment which contains two occurrences o f the name, one pureh' referential
and the other not:
(5)

Ciorgione was called ' C;iorgione' beca use of his size,

The first occurrence is purely referential. Substitution o n the basis of ( 1 )
converts ( 5 ) into another statement equally true:
Barbarelli was called 'Giorgione' because of hi, size,
The second occurrence of the personal name is no more referential than
any other occurrence within a context of q uotes,
It would not be quite accurate to conclude that an occurrence of a
name within single quotes is never referential. Consider the statements :

'Giorgione played chess' is true,

(7)

'Giorgione' named a chess player,

each of which is true or false according as the quotationless statement:
(8)

Giorgione played chess

is true or false. Our criterion of referential occurrence makes the occur­
rence of the name 'Giorgione' in ( 8 ) referential, and must make the oc­
currences of 'Giorgione' in ( 6 ) and (7) referential by the same token,
despite the presence of single quotes in ( 6 ) a n d ( 7 ) . The point about quo­
tation is not that it must destroy referential occurrence, hut that it can
(and ordinarily does ) destroy referential occurrence . The examples ( 6 )
and ( 7 ) are exceptional in that the special predicates 'is true' and 'named'
have the effect of undoing the single quotes-as is evident on compari­
son of ( 6 ) and (7) with ( 8 ) .
To get an example of another common type o f statement i n which
names do not occur referentially, consider any person who is called
Philip and satisfies the condition:
(9)

Philip is unaware that Tully denounced Catiline,

or perhaps the condition:
( 10)

Philip believes that 'T"egucigalpa is in Nicaragua.

Suhstitution on the basis of ( 3 ) transforms (9) into the statement:
(11)

Philip is unaware that Cicero denounced Catiline,

no doubt false. Substitution on the basis of the true identity:
Tegucigalpa

=

capital of Honduras

transforms the truth ( 1 0 ) likewise into the falsehood:
( 12)

Philip believes that the capital of Honduras is in Nicaragua.

We see therefore that the occurrences of the names 'Tully' and 'Teguci­
galpa' in ( 9 )-( 1 0 ) arc not purely referential.
In this there is a fundamental contrast between ( 9 ) , or ( 1 0 ) , and:
Crassus heard Tully denounce Catiline.
This statement affirms a relation between three persons, and the persons
remain so related independently of the names applied to them. But ( 9 )

Reference a n d '\1odality

cannot be considered simply as affirming a relation between three per­
sons, nor ( 1 0 ) a relation between person, city, and country-at least not
so long as we interpret our words in such a way as to admit ( 9 ) a n d ( 1 0 )
as true and ( I I ) and ( 1 2 ) as false.
Some readers may wish to construe unawareness and belief as rela­
tions between persons and statements, thus writing (9) and ( 1 0 ) i n the
manner:
(13)

Philip i s unaware o f 'Tully denounced Catiline:

( 14)

Philip believes 'Tegucigalpa is in Nicaragua:

in order 10 put within a context of single quotes everv not purely referen­
tial occurrence of a name. Church argues against this. In so doing he ex­
ploits the concept o f analyticity, concerning which we have felt misgiv­
i ngs (pp. 23-37 a bove) ; still his argument cannot be set lightly aside, nor
are we required here to take a stand on the matter. Suffice it to say that
there is certainly no need 10 reconstrue ( 9 )-( I 0) in the manner ( 1 3 )-( 1 4 ) .
What i s imperative i s t o observe merely that the contexts 'is unaware
that . . . ' and 'believes that . . . ' resemble the context of the single quotes
in this respect: a name may occur referenti" lly in a statement S and yet
not occur referentially in a longer statement which is formed by embed­
ding S in the context 'is unaware that . . . ' or ' believes that . . . . ' To sum
up the situation in a word, we may speak of the contexts 'is unaware
that . . . ' and 'believes that . . . ' as referentially opaque.' The same is true
of the contexts 'knows that . . . : 'says that . . . " 'doubts that . . . " 'is
surprised that . . . " etc. It would be tidy bur unnecessary to force all
referentially opaque contexts into the quotationa 1 mold; a lternatively
we can recognize quotation as one referentially opaque context among
many.
It will next be shown that referential opacity a fflicts also the so-called
modal contexts 'Necessarily . . . ' and 'Possihly . . . : at least when those
are given the sense of strict necessity and possibility as in Lewis's modal
logic.l According to the strict sense of 'necessarily' and 'possi bly,' these
statements would be regarded as true:

The general idea of strict modalities is based on the putative notion of
analyticity as follows: a statement of the form ' Necessarily . . . ' is true if
and only if the component statement which 'necessarily' governs is ana­
lytic, and a statement of the form 'Possibly . . . ' is false if and only if the
negation of the component statement which 'possibly' governs is ana­
lytic. Thus ( 1 5 ) -( 1 7) could be paraphrased as follows:
(21 )

' 9 > 7 ' is analytic,

(22)

' I f there is life on the Evening Star then there is life on the
Evening Star' is analytic,

(23)

'The number of planets is n o t less than 7' is n o t analytic,

and correspondingly for ( l H )-(20 ) .
That the contexts 'Necessarily . . . ' a n d 'Possibly . . . ' are referentially
opaque can now be quickly seen; for substitution on the basis of the true

irreferentially in ( 1 5 )-( 1 7) . To a rgue thus would b e like citing the equiv­

The phenomenon of referential opacity has just now been explained by
appeal to the hehavior of singular terms. But singular terms are eli min­
able, we know, by paraphrase. Ultimately the obj ects referred to in a the­
ory arc to be accounted not as the things named by the singular terms,
but as the values o f the variables of quantification. So, if referential
opacity is an infirmity worth worrying about, it must show symptoms in
connection with quantification as well as i n connection with singular
terms. Let us then turn our attention to quantification.
The connection between naming and quantification is implicit in the
operation whereby, from 'Socrates is mortal: we infer ' ( 3x) (x is mor­
tal),' that is, 'Something is morta l . ' This is the operation which was spo­
ken of earlier as existential generalization, except that we now have a
singular term 'Socrates' where we then had a free variable. The idea be­
hind such inference is that whatever is true of the obj ect named by a
given singular term is true of something; and clearly the inference loses
its j ustification when the singular term in question docs not happen to
name. From:

tha t is, 'There is something which there is no such thing as,' or 'There is
something which there is not.'
Such inference is of course equally unwarranted in the case of an
irreferential occurrence of any substantive. From (2), existential general­
ization would lead to:
( 3 x ) (x was so-called because of its size ) ,
t h a t is, 'Something w a s so-called because of i t s size . ' T h i s is clearly
meaningless, there being no longer any suitable antecedent for 'so­
called. ' Note, in contrast, that existential generalization with respect to
the purely referential occurrence in ( 5 ) yields the sound conclusion:
(3x)(x was called ' Giorgione' because of its size ) ,
that i s , 'Something w a s called ' Giorgione' because of its size . '
The logical operation of universal instantiation is that whereby w e in­
fer from 'Everything is itself,' for example, or in symbols ' (x ) (x = x ) , ' the
conclusion that Socrates = Socrates. This and existential generalization
are two aspects of a single principle; for instead of saying that ' ( x ) ( x =
x ) ' implies 'Socrates = Socrates,' we could as well say that the denial
'Socrates # Socrates' implies ' ( 3 x ) ( x # x ) . ' The principle embodied in
these two operations is the link between quantifications and the singular
statements that are related to them as instances. Yet it is a principle only
by courtesy. It holds only in the case where a term names and, further­
more, occurs referentially. It is simply the logical content of the idea that
a given occurrence is referentia l . The principle is, for this reason, anoma­
lous as an adj unct to the purely logical theory of quantification. Hence
the logical importance of the fact that all singular terms, aside from the
varia bles that serve as pronouns in connection with quantifiers, are dis­
pensable and eliminable by paraphrase.'
We saw j ust now how the referentially opaque context (2) fared under
existential generalization. Let us see what happens to our other referen­
tially opaque contexts. Applied to the occurrence of the personal name
in ( 4 ) , existential generalization would lead us to:

that is:

There is something s u c h t h a t ' i t ' contains s i x letters,

or perhaps:

'Something' contains six letters.

Now the expression:
'x' contains six letters
means simply:
The 24th letter of the alphabet contains six letters .
In ( 2 6 ) the occurrence of the letter within the context of quotes is as ir­
relevant to the quantifier that precedes it as is the occurrence of the same
letter in the context 'six.' ( 2 6 ) consists merely of a falsehood preceded by
an irrelevant quantifier. ( 2 7 ) is similar; its part:
'it' contains six letters
is false, and the prefix 'there is something such that' is irrelevant. ( 2 8 ) ,
again, is fa lse-if b y 'contains six' w e mean 'contains exactly six . '
It is less obvious, a n d correspondingly more important t o recognize,

of ( 1 5 ) and ( 1 6 ) raise the same questions as did ( 2 9 ) . What is this num­
ber which, according to ( 3 0 ) , is necessarily greater than 7 ? According to
( 1 5 ) , from which ( 3 0 ) was inferred, it was 9, that is, the number of plan­
ets; but to suppose this would conflict with the fact that ( 1 8 ) is false. In a
word, to be necessarily greater than 7 is not a trait of a number, but de­
pends on the manner of referring to the number. Again, what is the thing
x whose existence is affirmed in ( 3 1 ) ? According to ( 1 6 ) , from which
( 3 1 ) was infe rred, it was the Evening Star, that is, the Morning Star; but
to suppose this would conflict with the fact that ( 1 9 ) is false. Being nec­
essarily or possibly thus and so is in general not a trait of the object con­
cerned, but depends on the manner of referring to the obj ect.
Note that ( 3 0 ) and ( 3 1 ) are not to be confused with:
Necessarily ( 3 x ) ( x > 7 ) ,
Necessarily ( 3 x ) ( i f there is life on t h e Evening Star then there i s
life on x ) ,
which present no problem of interpretation comparable to that pre­
sented by ( 3 0 ) and ( 3 1 ) . The difference may be accentuated by a change
of example: in a game of a type admitting of no tie it is necessary that
some one of the players will win, but there is no one player of whom it
may be said to be necessary that he win.
We had seen, in the preceding section, how referential opacity mani­
fests itself in connection with singular terms; and the task which we then
set ourselves at the beginning of this section was to see how referential
opacity manifests itself in connection rather with varia bles of quanti­
fication. The answer is now apparent: if to a referentially opaque context
of a varia ble we apply a quantifier, with the intention that it govern that
variable from outside the referentially opaque context, then what we
commonly end up with is unintended sense or nonsense of the type ( 2 6 )­
( 3 1 ) . In a word, we cannot in general properly quantify into referentially
opaque contexts.
The context of quotation and the further contexts ' . . . was so called,'

Reference and Modality

'is unaware that . . . " 'believes that . . . " 'Necessarily . . . " and 'Possibly
. . . ' were found referentially opaque in the preceding section by consid­
eration of the failure of substitutivity of identity as applied to singular
terms. In the present section these contexts have been found referentially
opaque by a criterion having to do no longer with singular terms, but
with the miscarriage of quantification. The reader mav feel, indeed, that
in this second criterion we have not really got away from singular terms
after all; for the discrediting of the quantifications ( 2 9 )-( 3 1 ) turned still
on an expository interplay between the singular terms 'Tully' and
'Cicero,' ' 9 ' and 'the number o f planets,' 'Evening Star' and 'Morning
Star.' Actually, though, this expository reversion to our old singular
terms is avoidable, as may now be illustrated by re-arguing the meaning­
lessness of ( 3 0 ) in another way. Whatever is greater than 7 is a number,
and any given number x greater than 7 c a n be uniquely determined by
any of various conditions, some of which have 'x > 7' as a necessary
consequence and some of which do not. One and the same number x is
uniquely determined by the condition:
(32)

x

+

vx

+

Vx '" vx

and by the condition:
(33)

There arc exactly x planets,

but ( 3 2 ) has 'x > 7' as a necessary consequence while ( . B ) does not.
Necessary greaterness than 7 makes no sense as applied to a number x;
necessity attaches only to the connection between 'x > 7' and the partic­
ular method ( 3 2 ) , as opposed to ( 3 3 ) , of specifying x .
Similarly, ( 3 1 ) was meaningless because the sort of thing x which
fulfills the condition:
(34)

If there is life on the Evening Star then there is life o n x,

namely, a physical obj ect, can be uniquely determined by any of various
conditions, not all of which have ( 34 ) as a n ecessary consequence. Nec­
essary fulfillment of ( 3 4 ) makes no sense as applied to a physical obj ect
x; necessity attaches, at best, only 10 the connectio n between ( 3 4 ) and
one or another particular means of specifying x .
The importance of recognizing referential opacity is not easily over­
stressed . We saw in § 1 that referential opacity can obstruct slI hstitutivity
of identity. We now see that it also can interrupt quantification: quan­
tifiers outside a referentially opaque construction need have no bearing

369

on variables inside it. This again is obvious in the case of quotation, as
witness the grotesque example:
( 3x) ( ' six' contains 'x' ) .
3

We see from ( 3 0 ) -( 3 1 ) how a quantifier applied to a modal sentence may
lead simply to nonsense. Nonsense is indeed mere absence of sense, and
can always be remedied by arhitrarily assigning some sense. But the im­
portant point to observe is that granted an understanding of the mo­
dalities ( through uncritical acceptance, for the sake of argument, of the
underlying notion of analyticity) , and given an understanding of quan­
tification ordinarily so called, we do not come out automatically with
any meaning for quantified modal sentences such as ( 3 0 )-( 3 1 ) . This
point must he taken into account by anyone who undertakes to work
out laws for a quantified modal logic.
The root of the trouble was the referential opacity of modal contexts.
But referential opacity depends in part on the ontology accepted, that
is, on what ohjects are admitted as possihle obj ects of reference. This
may he seen most readily hy reverting for a while to the point of view of
§ 1 , where referential opacity was explained in terms of failure of inter­
changeahility of names which name the same ohject. Suppose now we
were to repudiate all ohj ects which, like 9 and the planet Venus, or Eve­
ning Star, are nameahle hy names which fail of interchangeability in
modal contexts. To do so would be to sweep away all examples indica­
tive of the opacity of modal contexts.
But what obj ects would remain in a thus purified universe? An ohject
x must, to survive, meet this condition: if S is a statement containing a
referential occurrence of a name of x, and S' is formed from S by suhsti­
tuting any different name of x , then S and S ' not only must be alike in
truth value as they stand, hut must stay alike in truth value even when
'necessarily' or 'possihly' is prefixed. Equivalently: putting one name
of x for another in any analytic statement must yield an analytic state­
ment. Equivalently: any two names of x must he synonymous.?
Thus the planet Venus as a material object is ruled out by the posses7. See above, p . 3 2 [Chapter 21. Synonymy of names does not mean merely nam�
ing the same thlllgj it means that the statement of identity formed of the two names is

sian of heteronymous names 'Venus,' 'Evening Star, ' 'Morning Star. '
Corresponding t o these three names w e must, if modal contexts are not
to he referentially opaque, recognize three objects rather than one-per­
haps the Venus-concept, the Evening-Star-concept, and the Morning­
Star-concept.
Similarly 9 , as a unique whole number between 8 and 1 0, is ruled out
by the possession of heteronymous names ' 9 ' and 'the number of the
planets . ' Corresponding to these two names we must, if Illodal contexts
are not to be referentially opaque, recognize two obj ects rather than one;
perhaps the 9-concept and the number-of-planets-concept. These con­
cepts are not numbers, for the one is neither identical with nor less than
nor greater than the other.
The requirement that any two names of x be synonymous might be
seen as a restriction not on the admissible obj ects x, but on the admissi­
ble vocabulary of singular terllls. So Ill u ch the worse, then, for this way
of phrasing the requirement; we have here simply one more manifesta­
tion of the superficiality of treating ontological questions from the van­
tage point of singular terms. The real insight, in danger now of being
obscured, was rather this: necessity does not properly apply to the ful­
fillment of conditions by objects (such as the ball of rock which is Venus,
or the number which numbers the planets ) , apart from special ways of
specifying them. This point was most conveniently brought out by con­
sideration of singular terms, but it is not abrogated by their elimination.
Let us now review the matter from the point of view of quantification
rather than singular terms.
From the point of view of quantification, the referential opacity of
modal contexts was reflected in the meaninglessness of such quantifica­
tions as ( 3 0 ) -( 3 1 ) . The crux of the trouble with ( 3 0 ) is that a number x
may be uniquely determined by each of two conditions, for example,
( 3 2 ) and ( 3 3 ) , which are not necessarily, that is, analytically, equivalent
to each other. But suppose now we were to repudiate all such obj ects and
retain only obj ects x such that any two conditions uniquely determining
x are analytically equivalent. All examples such as ( 3 0 )-( 3 1 ) , illustrative
of the referential opacity of modal contexts, would then be swept away.
It would come to make sense in general to say that there is an object
which, independently of any particular means of specifying it, is neces­
sarily thus and so. It would become legitimate, in short, to quantify into
modal contexts.
Our examples suggest no obj ection to quantifying into modal contexts

371

QUINTESSENCE

372

as long as the values of any variables thus quantified are limited to
intensional objects. This limitation would mean allowing, for purposes
of such quantification anyway, not classes but only class-concepts or at­
tributes, it being understood that two open sentences which determine
the same class still determine distinct attributes unless they are analyti­
cally equivalent. It would mean allowing, for purposes of such quan­
tification, not numbers but only some sort of concepts which are related
to the numbers in a many-one way. Further it would mean allowing, for
purposes of such quantification, no concrete objects but only what Frege
called senses of names, and Carnap and Church have called individual
concepts . It is a drawback of such an ontology that the principle of indi­
viduation o f its entities rests invariably on the putative notion of synon­
ymy, or analyticity.
Actually, even granted these dubious entities, we can quickly see that
the expedient of limiting the values of varia bles to them is after all a mis­
taken one. It does not relieve the original difficulty over quantifying into
modal contexts; on the contrary, examples quite as disturbing as the old
ones can be adduced within the realm of intensional objects. For, where
A is any intensional object, say an attribute, and 'p' stands for an arbi­
trary true sentence, clearly
(35)

A

=

( lX I I1) . (x

=

A)].

Yet, if the true sentence represented b y '1" i s not analytic, then neither i s
( 3 5 ) , a n d its sides are no more interchangeable in modal contexts than
are 'Evening Star' and 'Morning Star, ' or '9' and 'the number of the
planets . '
Or, to state t h e point without recourse t o singular terms, it is that the
requirement lately italicized-" any two conditions uniquely determin­
ing x are analytically equivalent"-is not assured merely by taking x
as an intensional object. For, think of 'Fx' as any condition uniquely de­
termining x, and think of 'fi' as any nonanalytic truth. Then ' p . Fx'
uniquely determines x bur is not analytically equivalent to 'Fx', even
though x be an intensional obj ecr.
It was in my 1 943 paper that I first obj ected to quantifying into modal
contexts, and it was in his review of it that Church proposed the remedy
of limiting the variables thus quantified to intensional values. This rem­
edy, which I have j ust now represented as mistaken, seemed all right at
the time. Carnap adopted it in an extreme form, limiting the range of his

Reference and Modaittv

variables to intensional obj ects throughout his system. He did not indeed
describe his procedure thus; he complicated the picture by propounding
a curious double interpretation of variables. But I have argued' that this
complicating device has no essential bearing and is better put aside.
By the time Church came to propound an intensional logic of his own,
he perhaps appreciated that quantification into modal contexts could
not after all be legitimized simply by limiting the thus quantified vari­
ables to intensional values. Anyway his departures are more radical. In­
stead of a necessity operator attachable to sentences, he has a necessity
predicate attachable to complex names of certain intensional obj ects
called propositions. What makes this departure more serious than it
sounds is that the constants and variables occurring in a sentence do not,
without special provision, recur in the name of the corresponding propo­
sition. Church makes such provision by introducing a primitive function
that applies to intensional obj ects and yields their extensions as values.
The interplay, usual in modal logic, between occurrences of expressions
outside modal contexts and recurrences of them i nside modal contexts,
is mediated in Church's system by this function. Perhaps we should not
call it a system of modal logic; Church generally did not. Anyway let
my continuing discussion be understood as relating to modal logics
only in the narrower sense, where the modal operator attaches to sen­
tences.
Church and Carnap tried-unsuccessfully, I have just argued-to
meet my criticism of quantified modal logic by restricting the values of
their variables. Arthur Smullyan took the alternative course of challeng­
ing my criticism itself. I [is argument depends on positing a fun damental
division of names into proper names and ( overt or covert) descriptions,
such that proper names which name the sallle o bj ect are always synony­
mous. ( Cf. ( 3 8 ) below. ) He observes, quite rightly on these assumptions,
that any examples which, like ( 1 5 )- ( 2 0 ) and (24)-( 2 5 ) , s h o w failure of
substitutivity of identity in modal contexts, must exploit some descrip­
tions rather th a n j ust proper names. Then, taking a leaf from Russell, he
explains the failure of substitutivity by differences in the structure of the
contexts, in respect of what Russell called the scopes of the descriptions."
As stressed in the preceding section, however, referential opacity remains

to be reckoned with even when descriptions and other singular terms are
eliminated altogether.
Nevertheless, the only hope of sustaining quantified modal logic lies in
adopting a course that resembles Smullyan's, rather than Church and
Carnap, in this way: it must overrule my objection. It must consist in ar­
guing or deciding that quantification into modal contexts makes sense
even though any value of the variable of such a quantification be deter­
minable by conditions that are not analytically equivalent to each other.
The only hope lies in accepting the situation illustrated by ( 3 2 ) and ( 3 3 )
a n d insisting, despite it, that the obj ect x in question is necessarily
greater than 7. This means adopting an invidious attitude toward certain
ways of uniquely specifying x, for example ( 3 3 ) , and favoring other
ways, for example ( 3 2 ) , as somehow better revealing the " essence " of
the object. Consequences of ( 3 2 ) can, from such a point of view, be
looked upon as necessarily true of the object which is 9 (and is the num­
ber of the planets ) , while some consequences of ( 3 3 ) are rated still as
only contingently true of that object.
Evidently this reversion to Aristotelian essentialism (d. p. 22) is re­
quired if quantification into modal contexts is to be insisted on. An ob­
j ect, of itself and by whatever name or none, must be seen as having
some of its traits necessarily and others contingently, despite the fact that
the latter traits follow j ust as analytically from some ways of specifying
the obj ect as the former traits do from other ways of specifying it. In
fact, we can see pretty directly that any quantified modal logic is bound
to show such favoritism among the traits of an obj ect; for surely it will
be held, for each thing x, on the one hand that

where 'p' stands for an arbitrary contingent truth.
Essentialism is a bruptly at variance with the idea, favored by Carnap,
Lewis, and others, of explaining necessity by analyticity. For the appeal
to analyticity can pretend to distinguish essential and accidental traits of
an object only relative to how the obj ect is specified, not absolutely. Yet
the champion of quantified modal logic must settle for essentialism.
Limiting the values of his variables is neither necessary nor sufficient

Refefence and .vl()J a [ l r�

to j ustify quantifying the variables into modal contexts. l.imiting their
values can, however, still have this purpose in conjunction with his es­
sentialism: if he wants to limit his essentialism to special sorts of obj ects,
he must correspondingly limit the values of the varia hies which he quan­
tifies into modal contexts.
The system presented in Miss Barcan 's pioneer papers on quantified
modal logic differed from the systcms of Carnap and Church in impos­
ing no special limitations on the values o f variables. That she was pre­
pared, moreover, to accept the essentialist presuppositions seems rather
hinted in her theorem:
(38)

(x ) ( y ) [ (x

=

y ) ::J [ necessarily (x

=

YI I I ,

for this is as if to say that some at least (and in fact at most; d. 'fJ . Fx ' ) of
the traits that determine an object do so necessarily. The modal logic in
Fitch I I I follows Miss Barcan o n both points. Note incidentally that ( 3 8 )
follows directly from ( 3 6 ) and a law o f substitutivity o f identity for vari­
ables:
(x)(y)f(x

The upshot o f these reflections i s meant t o b e that the way t o do
quantified modal logic, if at all, is to accept Aristotcli.1I1 essentia lism. ]()
defend Aristotelian essentialism, however, I S not part of mv plan. Such
a philosophy is as unreasonable by my lights as it is by Carnap's or
Lewis's. And in conclusion I say, as Carnal' and Lewis have not: so much
the worse for quantified modal logic. By implication, so much the worse
for unquantified modal logic as well; for, if we do not propose to quan­
tify across the necessity operator, the usc of th'lt operator ceases to have
any clear advantage over merely quoting a sentence and saying that it is
analytic.

The worries introduced by the logical lllodal itics are introduced also bv
the admission of attributes (as opposed to classes) . The Idiom 'the attri­
bute of being thus and so' is referentially opaque, as may be seen, for ex­
ample, frolll the fact that the true statement:
(39)

QUINTESSENCE

goes over into the falsehood:
The attribute of exceeding the number of the planets = the

which contains the variable of quantification within a context of the
form 'the attrihute of . . .' is exactly on a par with qua ntification of a
modal sentence.
Attributes, as remarked earlier, are individuated by this principle: two
open sentences which determine the same class do not determine the
same attribute unless they are analytically equivalent. Now another pop­
ular sort of intensional entity is the proposition. Propositions are con­
ceived in rclation to statemeots as attributes are conceived in relation to
open sentences: two statements determine the same proposition j u st in
case they arc analytically equivalent. The foregoing strictures on attri­
butes obviously apply equally to propositions. The truth :

The proposition that 9 > 7 = the proposition that 9 > 7

goes over into the falsehood:
The proposition that the number of the planets > 7 = the
proposition that 9 > 7.
under substitution according to (24). Existential generalization of ( 4 1 )
yields a result comparable to ( 2 9 ) -( 3 1 ) and ( 40 ) .
Most of the logicians, semanticists, a n d analytical philosophers who
discourse freely of attributes, propositions, or logical modalities betray
failure to appreciate that they thereby imply a metaphysical position
which they themselves would scarcely condone. It is noteworthy that in
Principia Mathematica, where attributes were nominally admitted as en­
tities, all actual contexts occurring in the course of formal work arc such
as could be fulfilled as well by classes as by attributes. All actual contexts
are extensional. The authors of Principia Mathematica thus adhered in
practice to a principle of extensionality which they did not espouse i n

Reference and Modality

theory. If their practice had been otherwise, we might ha ve been brought
sooner to an appreciation of the urgency of the principle.
We have seen how modal sentences, attribute terms, and proposition
terms conflict with the nonessentialist view of the universe. It must be
kept in mind that those expressions create such conflict only when they
are quantified into, that is, when they are put under a quantifier and
themselves contain the variable of quantification. We arc familiar with
the fact ( illustrated by ( 2 6 ) above) that a quotation cannot contain an ef­
fectively free varia ble, reachable by an outside quantifier. If we preserve
a similar attitude toward modalities, attribute terms, and proposition
terms, we may then make free use of them without any misgivings of the
present urgent kind.
What has been said of modality in these pages relates only to strict
modality. For other sorts, for example, physical necessity and possihility,
the first problem would be to formulate the notions clearly and exactly.
Afterward we could investigate whether such modalities, like the strict
ones, cannot he quantified into without precipitating an ontological cri­
sis. The question concerns intimately the practical use of language . It
concerns, for example, the use of the contrary-to-fact conditional within
a quantification; for it is reasonable to suppose that the contrary-to-fact
conditional red uces to the form 'Necessarily, if p then q ' in some sense of
necessity. Upon the contrary-to-fact conditional depends in turn, for ex­
ample, this definition of solubility in water: To say that an obj ect is solu­
ble in water is to say that it would dissolve if it were in water. In discus­
sil)l1s of physics, naturally, we need quantifications containing the clause
'x is soluble in water,' or the equivalent in words; but, according to the
definition suggested, we should then have to admit within quantifica­
tions the expression 'if x were in water then x would dissolve; that
is, 'necessarIly if x is in water then x dissolves. ' Yet we do not know
whether there is a suitable sense of 'necessarily' into which we can so
quant ify. I II
Any wav of imbedding statements within statements, whether based
on some notion of " necessity " or, for example, on a notion of " probabil­
ity " as in Reichenbach, must be carefully examined in relation to its sus­
cepti bility to quantification. Perhaps the only useful modes of statement

any rate, in mathematics; and mathematics, significantly, is the branch of
science whose needs arc most clearly understood.
Let us return, for a final sweeping ohservation, to our first test of refer­
ential opacity, namely, failure of substitutivity of identity; and let us sup­
pose that we are dealing with a theory in which ( a ) logically equivalent
formulas are i n terchangeable in all contexts salva veritate and (h) the
logic of classes is at han d . " For such a theory it can be shown that any
mode of statement composition, other than the truth functions, is refer­
entiallv opaque. For, let 1J and 1jJ be any statements alike in truth value,
and let q>(1J) be any true statement containing (I' as a part. What is to be
shown is that <P(IP) will also be true, unless the context represented by
'<p' is referentially opaque. Now the class named by a1J is either V or A,
according as 1J is true or false; for remember that 1J is a statement, devoid
of free (1 . ( If the notation (f.1J without recurrence of a seems puzzling,

There are several closely interrelated operators, called modal operators,
which are characteristic of modal logic. There are the operators of neces­
sity, !JOssibiltty, impossibility, non-necessity. Also there are the binary
operators, or connectives, of strict implication and strict equivalence.
These various operators are easily definable in terms of one another.
Thus impossibility is necessity of the negation; possibility and non-ne­
cessity are the negations of impossibility and necessity; and strict impli­
cation and strict equivalence arc necessity of the material conditional
and biconditional. In a philosophical examination of modal logic we
may therefore conveniently limit ourselves for the most part to a single
modal operator, that of necessity. Whatever may be said about necessity
may be said also, with easy and obvious adj ustments, about the other
modes.
There are three different degrees to which we may allow our logic, or
semantics, to embrace the idea of necessity. The first or least degree of
acceptance is this: necessity is expressed by a seman tical predicate attrib­
utable to statements as notational forms-hence attachable to names of
statements. We writc� e.g.:
(1)

Nee ' 9 > 5 ' ,

(2)

Nec ( Sturm's theorem ) ,

(3)

Nec 'Napoleon escaped from Elba,'

in each case attaching the predicate 'Nec' to a noun, a singular term,
which is a name of the statement which is affirmed to be necessary ( o r
necessarily true ) . O f t h e a bove examples, ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) w o u l d presumably
be regarded as true and ( 3 ) as false; for the necessity concerned in modal
logic is generally conceived to be of a logical or a priori sort.
379

380

QUINTESSENCE

A second and more drastic degree in which the notion of necessity
may he adopted is in the form of a statement operator. Here we have no
longer a predicate, attaching to names of statements as in (1 )-( 3 ) , but a
logical operator 'nec,' which attaches to statements themselves, in the
manner of the negation sign. Under this usage, ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) would be ren­
dered rather as:
(4)

nec (9 ) 5),

(5)

n e c ( Napoleon escaped from Elba ) ,

and ( 2 ) would be rendered b y prefixing 'nee' to Sturm's actual theorem
rather than to its name. Thus whereas 'Nee' is a predicate or verb, 'is
necessary,' which attaches to a noun to form a statement, 'nec' is rather
an adverb, ' necessarily,' which attaches to a statement to form a state­
ment.
Finally the third and gravest degree is expression of necessity by a sen­
tence operator. This is an extension of the second degree, and goes be­
yond it in allowing the attachment of 'nee' not only to statements but
also to open sentences, such as 'x > 5,' preparatory to the ultimate at­
tachment of quantifiers:
(6)

( x ) nee (x > 5 ) ,

(7)

( 3 x ) n e c (x > 5 ) ,

(8)

(x) [x

=

9 . ::J nee (x > 5 ) ] .

The example ( 6 ) would doubtless be rated as false, a n d perhaps ( 7 ) and
( 8 ) as true.
I shall be concerned in this paper to bring out the logical and philo­
sophical significance of these three degrees of acceptance of a necessity
device.

context simply to refer to its object. Occurrences within quotation are
not in general referential; e.g., the statements:
(9)

'Cicero' contains six letters,

( 1 0)

' 9 > 5' contains j ust three characters

say nothing a hout the statesman Cicero or the nllmber 9 . Frege's crite­
rion for referential occurrence is substitutivity of identity. Since
Cicero,

whatever is true of Cicero is true ipso tilctO of Tully ( these heing one and
the same) and whatever is true of 9 is true of the number of planets. If hy
putting 'Tully' for 'Cicero' or 'the numher of planet,;' for ' 9 ' in a truth,
e.g., ( 9 ) o r ( 1 0 ) , w e come out with a falsehood:
(13)

'Tully' contains six letters,

( 14)

'the numher of planets > 5 ' contains j ust three characters,

we may be sure that the position on which the substitution was made
was not purely referential.
(9) must not he confused with:
( 1 5)

Cicero has a six-letter name,

which does say something abollt the man Cicero, and�unlike ( 9 )�
remains true when the name 'Cicero' is supplanted by 'Tully. '
Taking a hint from Russell, 1 we may speak o f a context as referentially
o/Jaque when, by putting a statement rp into that context, we can cause a
purely referential occurrence in rp to be not purely referential in the
whole context. E.g., the context:
' . . . ' contains j ust three characters
is referentially opaque; for, the occurrence of '9' in '9 > 5 ' is purely refer­
ential, but the occurrence of ' 9 ' in ( 1 0 ) is not. Brieflv, a context is ref­
erentially opaque if it can render a referential occurrence non-referenti a l .
Quotation is the referentially opaque context p a r excellence. Intu­
itively, what occurs inside a referentially opaque context may be looked
upon as an orthographic accident, without logical status, like the occur3. \Xlhltehe.ld :-tnd Rus')el l, Prme/IJla Mathematica, 2d ed., vol. 1, AppendiX C.

rence of 'cat' in 'cattl e . ' The quotational context " 9 > S " of the state­
ment ' 9 > S' has, perhaps, unlike the context 'cattle' of 'cat,' a decep­
tively systematic air which tempts us to think of its parts as somehow
logically germane. Insofar as this temptation exists, it is salutary to para­
phrase quotations by the following expedient. We may adopt names for
,
each of our letters and other characters, and Tarski's , � to express con­
catenation. Then, instead of naming a notational form by putting that
notational form itself bodily between quotation marks, we can name it
by spelling it. E.g., since 'f/ ' is mu, ' E ' is epsilon, and 'v ' is nu, the word
'f/EV ' is mu�epsilon�nu . Similarly t h e statement '9 > 5 ' is n�gf, if we
adopt the letters 'n, ' 'g,' and 'f' as names of the characters '9,' ' > ', and
'S.' The example ( 1 0 ) can th us be transcribed as:
(16)

n�g�f contains j ust three characters.

I [ere there is no non-referential occurrence of the numeral '9,' for there
is no occurrence of it all; and here there is no referentially opaque con­
tainment of one statement by another, because there is no contained
statement at all. Paraphrasing ( 1 0 ) into ( 1 6 ) , so as to get rid altogether of
the opaquely contained statement '9 > 5 , ' is like paraphrasing 'cattle'
into 'kine' so as to rid it of the merely orthographic occurrence of the
term 'cat . ' Neither paraphrase is mandatory, but both are helpful when
the irreferential occurrences draw undue attention.
An occurrence of a statement as a part of a longer statement is called
truth-functional i f, whenever we supplant the contained statement by
another statement having the same truth value, the containing statement
remains unchanged in truth value. Naturally one would not expect oc­
currences of statements within referentially opaque contexts, such as
quotations, to be truth-functional. E.g., the truth ( 1 0 ) becomes false
when the contained statement ' 9 > 5' is supplanted by another, 'Napo­
leon escaped from Elba,' which has the same truth value as '9 > 5.'
Again the truth ( I ) is carried, by that same substitution, into the false­
hood ( 3 ) . One might not expect occurrences of statements within state­
ments to be truth-functional, in general, even when the contexts are not
referentially opaque; certainly not when the contexts are referentially
opaque.
Tn mathematical logic, however, a policy of extensionality is widely
espoused: a policy of admitting statements within statements truth­
functionally only ( apart of course from such contexts as quotation,
which are referentially opaque) . Note that the seman tical predicate 'Nec'

Three Grades of Modal Involvement

as o f ( 1 )-( 3 ) is reconcilanle with this policy of extensionality, since what­
ever breach of extensional ity it tnima facie involves is shared by exam­
ples like ( 1 0 ) and attributable to the referential opacity of quotation. We
can always switch to the spelling expedient, thus rewriting ( 1 ) as:
( 1 7)

Nec (n10:).

( 1 7), like ( 1 6 ) and indeed ( 2 ) and unlike ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , contains n o compo­
nent statement but only a name o f a statement.
The statement operator 'nec,' on the other hand, is a premeditated de­
parture from extensionality. The occurrence of the truth '9 > 5 ' in (4) is
non-truth-functional, since by supplanting it by a different truth we can
turn the true context (4) into a falsehood such as ( 5 ) . Such occurrences,
moreover, are not looked upon as somehow spurious or irrelevant to
logical structure, like occurrences in quotation or like 'cat' in 'catrle. ' On
the contrary, the modal logic typified in (4) is usually put forward as a
corrective of extensionality, a needed supplementation of an otherwise
impoverished logic. Truth-functional occurrence is hy no means the rule
in ordinary language, as witness occurrences of statements governed by
' because; 'thinks that: 'wishes that,' etc., as well as 'necessarily. ' Modal
logicians, ad opting 'nec; have seen no reason to suppose that an ade­
quate logic might adhere to a policy of extensionality.
But, for all the willingness of modal logicians to flout the policy of
extensionality, is there really any difference-on the score of extension­
ality-between their statement operator 'nec' and the extensionally q u ite
admissible seman tical predicate 'Nec ' ? T h e latter w a s excusable, within
a policy of extensionality, by citing the referential opacity of quotation.
But the statement operator 'nec' is likewise excusable, within a policy of
extensionality, by citing the referential opacity of 'nec' itself! To see the
referential opacity of 'nec' we have only to note that (4) and ( 1 2 ) are true
and yet this is false:

(18)

nec ( the number of planets > 5 ) .

The statement operator 'nec' is, i n short, on a part with quotation. ( 1 )
happens to be written with quotation marks and ( 4 ) without, but from
the point of view of a policy of extensionality one is no worse than the
other. ( I ) might be preferable to ( 4 ) only on the score of a possible ancil­
lary policy of trying to red uce referentially opaque contexts to uniformly
quota tiona I form.

Q u r :'JT E S S E N C E

Genuine violation of the extensionality policy, hy admitting non­
truth-functional occurrences of statements within statements without
referential opacity, is less easy than one at first supposes. Extensionality
does not merely recommend itself on the score of simplicity and conve­
nience; it rests on somewh at more compelling grounds, as the following
argument will reveal. Think of 'p' as short for some statement, and think
of ' 1'(1) ) ' as shorr for some containing true statement, such that the con­
text represented by 'j-" is not referentially opaque. Suppose further that
the context represented by 'F' is such that logical equivalents are inter­
changeable, within it, salva veritate. IThis is true in particular of 'nec. ' )
What I shall show is that the occurrence of 'p' in 'Flp ) ' is then truth­
functional. I . e . , think of 'q ' as short for some statement having the same
truth value as 'fJ'; I shall show that ' Fl q ) ' is, like 'FIP ) ' , true.
What 'fJ' represents is a statement, hence true or false land devoid of
free 'x' ) . If '(/ is true, then the conj unction 'x = A . ( i s true if one
and only one obj ect x, viz., the empty class A; whereas if 'fJ' is false
the conj unction 'x = A . p' is true of no ohject x whatever. 'fhe class
xix = A , () ) , therefore, is the unit class I A or A itself according as '(i' is
true or false. Moreover, the equation:
/

xix = A . p ) = I A
is, b y the a bove considerations, logically equivalent t o 'p'. Then, since
'FIP) ' is true and logical equivalents are interchangeable within it, this
will be true:
(19)

Flxlx = A . p ) = I A I .

Since ' fJ' a n d 'q' arc alike i n truth value, the classes x i x = A . p ) and
xix = A . q ) are both I A or hoth A; so
(20)

xix = A . p ) = xix = A . q ) .

Since the context represented b y 'F' i s not referentially opaque, the oc­
currence of 'xix = A . p ) ' in ( 1 9 ) is a purely referential occurrence and
hence subject to the su bstitutivity of identity; so from ( 1 9 ) b y ( 2 0 ) we
can conclude that

Flxlx = A . q ) = I A I .
Thence i n turn, bv the logical equivalence of 'xix = A . q ) = I N to 'q',
we conclude that £'( q ) .
T h e a bove argument cannot be evaded by denying ( 2 0 ) , as long as the

notation in (20) is construed, as mual, as referring to classes. For
classes, properly so-called, arc one and the same if their members arc the
same-regardless of whether that sameness be a matter of l ogical proof
or of historical accident. But the argument could he contested bv one
who does not admit class names 'xl
).' It could also be contested by
one who, though admitting such class names, does not sec a final crite­
rion of referentia l occu rrence in the substitutivity of identity, as applied
to constant singular terms. These points will come up, perforce, wben
we turn to 'nec' as a sentence operator under quantification. Meanwhile
the above argument does serve to show that the policy of extensionality
has more behind it than its obvious simplicity and convenience, and that
any real departure from the policv ( at least where logical equivalents re­
main interchangeable) must involve revisions of the logic of singu l a r
terms.
'fhe simpler earlier argument for the referential opacitv of the state­
ment operator ' nee; viz., observation of the truths (4) and ( 1 2 ) and the
falsehood ( 1 8 ) , could likewise h e contested h y one who either repudiates
constant singular terms or questions the criterion of referential opacity
which involves them. Short of adopting 'nec' as a fu ll-fledged sentence
operator, however, no such searching revisions of classical mathematical
logic are required. We can keep to a classical theory o f classes and singu­
lar terms, and even to a policy of extensionality. We have only to recog­
nize, in the statement operator 'nee; a rderentially opaque context com­
para ble to the thoroughly legitimate and very convenient context of
quotation. We can even look upon (4) and ( 5 ) as elliptical renderings of
( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .

Something very much to the purpose of the semantical predicate 'Nec' is
regularly needed in the theory of proof. When, e.g., we speak of the com­
p leteness of a deductive system of quantification theory, we have i n mind
some concept of vaildtty as norm with which to compare the class of oh­
tainahle theorems. 'fhe notion of validity in such contexts is not iden­
tifiahle with truth . A true statement is not a valid statement of quanti­
fication theory unless not only it but all other statements similar to it in
quantificational structure are true. Defin ition of such a notion of validity
presents no problem, and the importance of the notion for proof theory
is incontesta ble.
A conspicuous derivative of the notion of quantificational validity is

385

386

QUINTESSEN CE
that of quantificational implication. One statement quantification ally
implies another if the material conditional composed of the two state­
ments is valid for quantification theory.
This reference to quantification theory is only ill ustrative. There are
parallels for truth-function theory: a statement is valid for truth-function
theory if it and all statements like it in truth-functional structure a re
true, and one statement truth-functionally implies another if the mate­
rial conditional formed of the two sta tements is valid for truth-function
theory.
And there are parallels, again, for logic taken as a whole: a statement
is logically valid if it and all statements like it in logical structure are
true, and one statement logically implies another if the material comli­
tional formed of the two statements is logically valid.
Modal logic received special impetus years ago from a confused read­
ing of ' :::J' , the material 'if-then , ' as 'implies': a confusion of the material
conditional with the relation of implication.4 Properly, whereas ' :::J ' or
'if-then' connects statements, 'implies' is a verh which connects names
of statements and thus expresses a relation of the named statements.
Carelessness over the distinction of use and mention having allowed this
intrusion of 'implies' as a reading of ' :::J ', the protest thereupon arose
that ' :::J ' in its material sense was too weak to do j ustice to 'implies,'
which connotes something like logical implication. Accordingly an effort
was made to repair the discrepancy by introducing a n improved substi­
tute for ' :::J ', written ' J ' and called strict implication . ' The initial failure
to distinguish usc from mention persisted; so ' -3 ' , though read 'implies'
and motivated hy the connotations of the word 'implies,' functioned ac­
tually not as a verb bur as a statement connective, a much strengthened
'if-then . ' Finally, in recognition of the fact that logical implication is va­
lidity of the material conditional, a validity operator 'nec' was adopted
to implement the definition o f 'fJ -j q' as 'nec (fJ :::J q).' Since ' -3 ' had heen
left at the level of a statement connective, 'nec' in turn was of course
rendered as an operator directly attachahle to statements-whereas 'is
valid,' properly, is a verb attachable to a name of a statement and ex­
pressing an attribute of the statement named."
In any event, the use o f 'nee' as statement operator is easily converted

Here, however, we must beware of a subtle confusion. A quotation
names precisely the expression inside it; a quoted ' p ' names the sixteenth
letter of the alphabet and nothing else. Thus whereas ( 2 5 ) and ( 2 6 ) are
schemata or diagrams which depict the forms of actual statements, such
as ( 2 1 ) and ( 2 2 ) , on the other hand ( 2 7 ) and ( 2 8 ) are not schemata de­
picting the forms of actual statements such as ( 2 3 ) and ( 2 4 ) . On the con­
trary, (27) and ( 2 8 ) are not schemata at all, but actual statements: state­
ments about the specific schemata ' p', ' p V q, ' and 'p :::l . 11 V q ' ( with j ust
those letters ) . Moreover, the predicates 'implies' and 'Nec' have thus
far been looked upon as true only of statements, not of schemata: so in

( 2 7 ) and ( 2 8 ) they are misapplied ( pending some deliherate extension of
usage ) .
The letters ' p ' a n d 'q' in ( 2 5 ) a n d ( 2 6 ) stand in place of statements. For
translation of ( 2 5 ) and (26) into semantical form, on the other hand, we
need some special variables which refer to statements and thus stand in
place of names of statements. Let us usc '1J', 1/, etc., for that purpose.
Then the analogues of ( 2 5 ) and ( 2 6 ) in semantical form can be rendered:
'

(29)

1J implies t h e alternation of 1J and 1/1,

(30)

Nec ( the conditional of 1J with the alternation of 1J a n d 1jJ ) .

We c a n condense ( 2 9 ) and ( 3 0 ) by use of a conventional notation which I
have elsewhere- called quasi-qu()tatlon, thus:
(3 1 )

1J implies '1J

V

1/" ,

(32)

Nec '1J :J . 1J

The relationship hetween the modal logic of statement operators and
the semantical approach, which was pretty simple and obvious when we
compared (21 )-(22 ) with ( 2 3 )-(24), is thus seen to take on some slight
measure of subtlety at the stage of ( 2 5 )-( 2 6 ) ; these correspond not to
(27)-( 2 8 ) hut to ( 3 1 )-( 3 2 ) . It is schemata like ( 2 5 )- ( 2 6 ) , moreover, and
not actual statements like (21 )-( 2 2 ) , that fill the pages of works on
modal logic. I [owever, be that as it may, it is in actual statements such as
(21 )-(24) that the point of modal logic lies, and it is the comparison of
( 2 1 )-( 2 2 ) with ( 2 3 )-(24) that reflects t h e true relationship between the
use of statement operators and that of seman tical predicates. Schemata
such as ( 2 5 ) -( 2 6 ) are mere heuristic devices, useful in expounding the
theory of ( 2 1 )-( 2 2 ) and their like; and the heuristic devices which hear
similarly on ( 2 3 )-(24) are ( 3 1 )-( 3 2 ) .
Seeing h o w modal statement operators can h e converted into semanti­
cal predicates, one may of course j ust note the conversion as a princi­
ple and leave it undone in practice. But there are five reasons why it is
important to note it in principle. One is that the inclination to condemn
' :J ' unduly, through a wrong association of 'if-then' with 'implies,' is
thereby removed. A second reason is that it is at the seman tical or proof­
theoretic level, where we talk about expressions and their truth values
under various substitutions, that we make clear and useful sense of logi7. MathematlcaI 1.01i1c, § 6 .

Th ree Grades of J\;lodal I nvolvement

cal validity; and it is logical validity that comes nearest to being a clear
explication of 'Nee; taken as a semantical predicate. A third reason is
that in using 'Nee' as a semantical predicate we flaunt a familiar re­
minder of referential opacity, in the form of quotation marks. A fourth
reason is that the a doption of 'nee' as a statement operator tempts one to
go a step further and usc it as a sentence operator subject to quantifica­
tion. The momentousness of this further step-whereof more anon­
tends to be overlooked save as one expressly conceives of the 'nee, ' in its
use as statement operator, as shorthand for the semantical usage.
A fifth reason has to do with iteration. Since 'nee' attaches to a state­
ment and produces a statement, 'nec' can then be applied again. On the
other hand 'Nee' attaches to a name and yields a statement, to which,
therefore, it cannot he applied again. An iterated 'nee; e . g . :
(33)

n e c nec ( x ) ( x is r e d :::J x is red ) ,

c a n of comse h e translated by our regular procedure into semantical
form thus:
(34)

N e c 'Nee ' ( x ) ( x is r e d :::J x is red ) ' "

and we are thereby reminded that 'Nee' can indeed he iterated if we in­
sert new quotation marks as needed . But the fact remains that (34) is, in
contrast with ( 3 3 ) , an unlikely move. For, suppose we have made fair
sense of 'Nee' as l ogical validity, relative say to the logic of truth func­
tions, quantification, and perhaps classes. The statement:
(35)

( x ) ( x is red :::J x is red ) ,

then, is typical of the statements t o which w e would attribute such valid­
ity; so
(36)

Nec ' ( x l i x is r e d :::J x i s red ) ' .

The validity of ( 3 5 ) resides in the fact that ( 3 5 ) is true and so are all other
statements with the same quantificational and truth-functional structure
as ( 3 5 ) . Thus it is that ( 3 6 ) is true. But if ( 3 6 ) in turn is also valid, it is
valid only in a n extended sense with which we are not likely to have been
previously concerned: a sense involving not only quantificational and
truth-functional structure but also the semantical structure, somehow, of
quotation and 'Nec' itself.
Ordinarily we work in a metalanguage, as in ( 3 6 ) , treating of an ob-

389

QUINTESSENCE

390

j ect language, exemplified hy ( 3 5 ) . We would not rise to ( 3 4 ) except in
the rare case where we want to treat the metalanguage hy means of itself,
and want furthermore to extend the notion of validity beyond the se­
mantics of logic to the semantics of semantics. When on the other hand
the statement operator 'nee' is used, iteration as in ( 3 3 ) is the most natu­
ral of steps; and it is significant that in modal logic there has been some
question as to j ust what might most suitably be postulated regarding
such iteration.'
The iterations need not of course be consecutive. In the use of modal
statement operators we are led also into complex iterations such as:

( 37)

p 3 q . CJ.

�

q -J � I) ,

short for:
(38)

nee [nee (() :J q ) :J nee ( � q :J � P I ] .

Or, t o take an actual example:

(x)(x h a s mass) -4 (3x)(x h a s mass ) .-4.
� (3x)(x has mass) -4 (x)(x has mass) ,
�.

(40)

nec [nee [ ( x l i x h a s mass) :J (3x)(x h a s mass ) ] :J
nee [ � (3x)(x has mass) :J � (x)(x has mass ) ] ) .

In terms of seman tical predicates the correspondents of ( 3 9 ) a n d ( 4 0 )
arc:
(4 1 )

" ( x ) (x has mass ) ' implies '(3x)(x has mass ) " implies
" � (3x)(x has mass ) ' implies ' � (x ) (x has mass ) " ,

( 42 )

Nec 'Nec ' (xlix has mass) :J (3x)(x has mass ) ' :J
Nee ' � ( 3x)(x has mass) :J � (x)(x has mass ) " .

B u t ( 4 1 )-(42 ) , like ( 3 4 ) , have singularly little interest or motivation
when we think of necessity semantically.
It is important to note that we must not translate the schemata ( 3 7)­
( 3 8 ) into semantical form in the manner:
"P' implies 'q" implies, etc.
To do so would he to compound, to an altogether horrifying degree, the

error noted earlier of equating ( 2 5 )-( 2 6 ) to (27)-( 2 8 ) . The analogues of
( 3 7)-( 3 8 ) in semantical application should be rendered rather:
(43 )

'¢ implies 1jJ' implies " �1jJ ' implies ' �¢ ",

(44)

Nec 'Nec '¢ ::J 1jJ' ::J Nec ' �1jJ ::J �¢ ",

subj ect to some special conventions governing the nesting of qua,i­
quotations. Such conventions would turn on certain subtle consider­
ations which will not be entered upon here. Suffice it to recall that the
sort of thing formulated in ( 3 3 )-( 3 4 ) and ( 3 7)-(44) is precisely the ,on
of thing we are likely to see least point in formulating when we think of
necessity strictly as a semantical predicate rather than a statement opera­
tor. It is impressive and significant that most of modal logic ( short of
quantified modal logic, to which we shall soon turn) is taken up with it­
erated cases like ( 3 3 ) and ( 3 7)-(40) which would simply not recommend
themselves to our attention if necessity were held to the status of a se­
mantical p redicate and not depressed to the level of a statement op­
erator.
Our reflections have favored the semantical side immensely, but they
must not be allowed to o bscure the fact that even as a semantical predi ­
cate necessity can raise grave questions. There is no difficulty as long as
necessity is construed as valid ity relative ,ay to the logic of truth func­
tions and quantification and perhaps classes. If we think of arithmetic as
reduced to class theory, then such validity covers also the truths of arith­
metic. But one tends to include further territory still; cases such as 'No
bachelor is married,' whose truth is supposed to depend on " meanings
of terms " or on " synonymy" ( e . g . , the synonymy of 'bachelor' and 'man
not married ' ) . The synonymy relation o n which sllch cases depend i,
supposedly a narrower relation than that of the mere coextensiveness
of terms, and it is not known to be amenable to any satisfactory analy­
sis. I n short, necessity in semantical application tends to be identified
with what philosophers call a n alyticity; and analyticity, I have argued
elsewhere,' is a pseudo-concept which philosophy would be better off
without.
As long as necessity in semantical application i s construed simply as
explicit truth-functional validity, on the other hand, or quant i ficational
validity, or set-theoretic validity, or validity of any other well-determined
kind, the logic of the semantical necessity predicate is a significant and

very central strand of proof theory. But it is not modal logic, even un­
quantified modal logic, as the latter ordinarily presents itself; for it is a
remarkably meager thing, bereft of all the complexities which are en­
couraged by the use of 'nec' as a statement operator. It is unquantified
modal logic minus all principles which, explicitly or implicitly (via '-3',
etc. ) , involve iteration of necessity; and plus, if we are literal-minded, a
pair of quotation marks after each 'Nec.'
III

Having adopted the operator '-' of negation as applicable to state­
ments, one applies it without second thought to open sentences as well:
sentences containing free variables ripe for quantification. Thus we can
write not only ' - ( Socrates is morta l ) ' but also ' - (x is morta l ) , ' from
which, by quantification and further negation, we have ' - (x ) - ( x is
mortal ) , or briefly ' ( 3x)(x is morta l ) . ' With negation this is as it should
be. As long as 'nec' is used as a statement operator, on a par with nega­
tion, the analogous course suggests itself again: we write not only 'nec
( 9 ) 5)' but also 'nec (x > 5 ) , ' from which by quantification we can form
( 6 )-( 8 ) and the like.
This step brings us to 'nec' as sentence operator. Given 'nec' as state­
ment operator, the step is natural. Yet it is a drastic one, for it suddenly
obstructs the earlier expedient of translation into terms of 'Nec' as se­
mantical predicate. We can reconstrue (4) and ( 5 ) at will as ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ,
b u t w e cannot reconstrue:
(45)

n e c (x > 5 )

correspondingly a s :
(46)

Nec 'x > 5 ' .

'Nec' h a s been understood up t o n o w as a predicate true only of state­
ments, whereas ( 4 6 ) attributes it rather to an open sentence and is thus
trivially false, at least pending some deliberate extension of usage. More
important, whereas ( 4 5 ) is an open sentence with free 'x', ( 4 6 ) has no
corresponding generality; (46) is simply a statement about a specific
open sentence. For, it must be remembered that 'x > 5' in quotation
marks is a name of the specific quoted expression, with fixed letter 'x' .
The 'x' in ( 4 6 ) cannot be reached by a quantifier. To write:

Three Grade� of '\;lo(td fnvolvement

(47)

( x ) (Nec 'x > 5 ' ) ,

( 3 x ) ( Nec 'x > 5 ' )

is like writing:
(48)

( x ) ( Socrates is morta l ) ,

( 3 x ) ( Socrates is morta l ) ;

t h e quantifier is followed by no germane occurrence of i t s variable. In a
word, necessity as sentence operator docs not go over into terms of ne­
cessity as semantical predicate .
.\10reover, acceptance of necessity as a sentence operator implies an
attitude quite opposite to our earlier one (in § § I-II a bove ) , which was
that 'nee' as statement operator is referentially opaque. For, one would
clearly have no business quantifying into a referentially opaque context;
witness (47) above. We can reasonably infer ' ( 3x ) nec (x > 5 ) ' from 'nee
(9 > 5 ) ' only if we regard the latter as telling us something about the ob­
ject 9, a number, viz. that it necessarily exceeds 5. If 'nec ( . . . > 5 ) ' can
turn out true or false "of" the number 9 depending merely on how that
number is referred to ( a s the falsity of ( 1 8 ) suggests), then evidently 'nee
(x > 5)' expresses no genuine condition on obj ects of any kind. If the oc­
currence of '9' in 'nec (9 > 5 ) ' is not purely referential, then putting 'x'
for '9' in 'nec (9 > 5 ) ' makes no more sense than putting 'x' for 'nine'
within the context 'canine . '
B u t isn't it settled by t h e truth of ( 4 ) and ( 1 2 ) and t b e falsity of ( 1 8 )
that the occurrence o f '9' i n question i s irrcferential, and more generally
that 'nec' is referentially opaque, and hence that 'nec' as a sentence oper­
ator under quantifiers is a mistak e ? No, n o t i f one is prepared to accede
to certain pretty drastic departures, as we shall see.
Thus far we have tentatively condemned necessitv as general sentence
operator on the ground that 'nec' is referentially opaque. Its referential
opacity has been shown by a brcakdown in the operation of putting one
constant singular term for another which names the same obj ect. But it
may j ustly be protested that constant singular terms are a notational ac­
cident, not needed at the level o f primitive notation .
For it is well known that primitively nothing in the waY of singular
terms is needed except the variables of quantification themselves. Deriv­
atively all manner of singular terms may be in troduced by contextual
definition in conformity with Russell's theory of singular descriptions.
Class names, in particular, which figured in the general argument for
extensionality i n §! above, may be got either by explaining 'i'( . . ) ' as

short for the contextually defined description '(1Y)(X)(X E Y . == . . . ) ' or
by adopting a separate set of contextual definitions for th e purpose. iO
Now the modal logician intent on quantifying into 'nee' sentences
may say that 'nee' is not referentially opaque, but that it merely inter­
feres somewhat with the contextual definition of singular terms. He may
argue that ' ( 3 x ) nee (x > 5 ) " is not meaningless hut true, and in particu­
lar that the number 9 is one of the things of which 'nee (x > 5 ) ' is true.
He may blame the real or apparent discrepancy in truth value between
(4) and ( 1 8 ) simply on a queer behavior of contextually defined singular
terms. Specifically he may hold that ( 1 8 ) is true if construed as:
(49)

( 3 x) [there a r e exactly x planets . n e c (x > 5 ) 1

and false i f construed as:
(50)

n e e ( 3 x ) ( there a r e exactly x planets . x > 5 ) ,

a n d that ( 1 8 ) a s i t stands i s ambiguous for lack of a distinguishing mark
favoring ( 4 9 ) or ( 5 0 ) . ' 1 No such amhiguity arises in the contextual defi­
nition of a singular term in extensional logic (as long as the named ob­
j ect exists ) , and our modal logician may well deplore the complications
which thus issue from the presence of 'nee' in his primitive notation. Still
he can fairly protest that the erratic behavior of contextually defined sin­
gular terms is no reflection on the meaningfulness of his primitive nota­
tion, including his open 'nee' sentences and his quantification of them.
Looking upon quantification as fundamental, and constant singular
terms as contextually defined, one must indeed concede the inconclusive­
ness of a criterion of referential opacity that rests on interchanges of con­
stant singular terms. The obj ects of a theory arc not properly describable
as the things named by the singular terms; they are the values, rather, of
the variables of quantification. " Fundamentally the proper criterion of
referential opacity turns on quantification rather than naming, and is
this: a referentially opaque context is one that cannot properly be quan­
tified into ( with quantifier outside the context and variable inside ) . Quo10. See my Methods of Logic ( New York: Holt, 1 950; rev. eds . , 1 95 9 , 1 972),

tation, again, is the referentially opaque context par excellence; cf. ( 4 7 ) .
However, to object to n ecessity as sentence operator on t h e grounds o f
referential opacity so defined w o u l d be simply t h e b e g t h e question.
Frege's criterion of referential occurrence, viz., substitutivity of iden­
tity, underlay the notion of referent i a l opacity as developed in § I above.
Tbe statements of identity there concerned were formed of constant sin­
gular terms; d. ( 1 1 ) , ( \ 2 ) . But there is a more fundamental form of the
law of su bstitutivity of identity, which involves no constant singular
terms, but only variables of quantification; viz.:

(51 )

(x)(y) (x = )' . :J . Fx

==

Fy) .

This law i s independent o f any theory o f singular terms, a n d can­
not properly be challenged. For, to challenge it were simply to use the
sign ' = ' in some unaccustomed way irrelevant to our inquiry. Tn any the­
ory, whatever the shapes of its symbols, an open sentence whose free
variables are 'x' and 'y' is a n expression of identity only in case it fulfills
( 5 1 ) in the role of 'x = y. ' The generality of 'F' in ( 5 1 ) i s this: J'x i s t o be
interpretable as any open sentence of the system in question, having 'x'
as free ( quantifiable) variable; and 'Fy', of course, is to be a correspond­
ing context of 'y'.
If 'nec' is not referentially opaque, 'Fx' and 'Fy' in ( 5 \ ) can in particu­
lar be taken respectively as 'nec (x = x)' and 'nec (x = y ) . ' From ( 5 1 ) ,
therefore, since surely 'nec (x = xl' is true for all x, we have:
'

(52)

'

( x ) ( y ) [ x = y . :J n e c (x = y ) ] .

I . e . , identity holds necessarily if it holds at all.
Let us not j ump to the conclusion, just because ( 1 2 ) i s true, that

(53)

nec ( the number of planets = 9 ) .

This does not follow from ( 1 2 ) a n d ( 5 2 ) except with help of a l a w of uni­
versal instantiation, allowing us to put singular terms 'the number of
planets' and '9' for the universally quantified 'x' and 'y' of ( 5 2 ) . Such
instantiation is allowable, certainly, in extensional logic; but it is a ques­
tion of good behavior o f constant singular terms, and we have lately ob­
served that such behavior is not to be counted on when there is a ' nec' in
the woodpile.
So our observations on necessity in quantificational application are,
up to now, as follows. Necessity in such application is not prima facie

395

QUINTESSENCE

396

absurd if we accept some interference in the contextual definition of sin­
gular terms. The effect of this interference is that constant singular terms
cannot be manipulated with the customary freedom, even when their ob­
jects exist. In particular they cannot be used to instantiate universal
quantifications, unless special supporting lemmas are at hand. A further
effect of necessity in quantificational application is that objects come to
be necessarily identical if identical at all.
There is yet a further consequence, and a particularly striking one:
Aristotelian essentialism. This is the doctrine that some of the attributes
of a thing ( quite independently of the language in which the thing is
referred to, if at all) may be essential to th e th ing, and others acciden­
tal. E.g., a man, or talking animal, or featherless biped ( for they are in
fact all the same things ) , is essentially rational and accidentally two­
legged and talkative, not merely qua man but qua itself. More formally,
what Aristotelian essentialism says is that you can have open sen­
tences-which I shall represent here as 'Fx' and 'Gx'-such that
(54)

( 3 x ) ( nec Fx . Gx . � n e e Gx ) .

A n example of ( .5 4 ) related t o the falsity of ( 5 3 ) might be:
(3x) i nec(x > 5) . there are j ust x planets .
� nec ( there are j ust x planets ) ] ,
such an object x being the number ( by whatever name) which IS varI­
ously known as 9 and the number of planets.
How Aristote l ian essentialism as a bove formulated is required by
quantified modal logic can be quickly shown. Actually something yet
stronger can be shown: that there are open sentences 'rx' and ' Gx' ful­
filling not merely (54) but:
( x ) ( nec Fx . Gx . � nee Gx ) ,
I.e.:

(x) n e e F x . (x) Gx . ( x ) � n e e Gx.
An appropriate choice of ' rx' is easy: 'x x.' And an appropriate choice
of 'Gx' is 'x x p,' where in place of ' p' any statement is chosen which
is true but not necessarily true. Surely there is such a statement, for oth­
erwise 'nec' would be a vacuous operator and there would be no point in
modal logic.

Necessity as semantical predicate reflects a non-Aristotelian view of
necessity: necessity resides in the way in which we say things, and not in
the things we talk about. Necessity as statement operator is capable, we
saw, of being reconstrued in terms of necessity as a semantical predicate,
but has, nevertheless, its special dangers; it makes for an excessive and
idle elaboration of laws of iterated modality, and it tempts one to a final
plunge into quantified modality. This last complicates the logic of singu­
lar terms; worse, it leads us back into the metaphysical j ungle of Aristo­
telian essentialism.
