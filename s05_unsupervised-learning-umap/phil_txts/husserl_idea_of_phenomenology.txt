TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

In the winter semester of 1902J03. Edmund Husserl offered a lecture course

at the University of G<>ttingen on the general theory of knowledge. At the

conclusion of that course he recorded the following sentiment on the envelope

containing his lecture notes: "From time to time I am born up by the convic­

tion that I have made more progress in the critique of knowledge than any of

my predecessors, that I have seen with substantial and, in some respects,

complete clarity what my predecessors scarcely suspected or else left in a state
of confusion. And yet: what a mass of unclarity in these pages. how much

half-done work, how much anguishing uncertainty in the details. How much
is still just preliminary work, mere struggle on the way to the goal and not the

full goal itself. actually achieved and seen from every side? Will it not be

given to me, with powerfu) effort redoubled and with the application of all my
vital energies, actually to arrive at the goal? Is this half clarity, this tonuous

restlessness, which is a sign of unresolved problems, beamble? Thus I am.

after many years, still the beginner and the student. But I want to become the
master! Carpe diem. "J On November 4. 1903. he added this dismal observa­

tion, 'The anguish only grows greater, and I remain in the same old place. No
progress has been made.,,2

The philosophical impasse Husserl experienced in the years inunediately
following the publication of the Logical Investigations (1900101) was
compounded by serious professional disappointment in 1905. In April of that

year, the Ministerium had made known its intention of appointing Husserl as
an

associate

professor (Ordinarius) at the University of G<>ttingen. But on

May 11th the appointment was blocked by the Philosophy Faculty. In his

diary, Husserl recorded the reason for its opposition: "the lack of my scientific
,,
significance. 3 Undeterred by this vote of no confidence from his colleagues.
Husserl remained resolute in his critical inquiries. It was during this time. in
fact, that his philosophical ambition grew to Kantian proportions: having
published limited studies in the philosophy of arithmetic and logic. he now

took upon himself the task of providing a comprehensive critique of reason in

its several divisions - theoretical, practical. and evaluative.

At some point between 1903 and 1905 Husserl finally achieved insight into

the methodological procedure required by the general problem of knowledge.
On February 18, 1905, he made the following triumphant entry in his

note book: "I am so fmnly convinced that in it I possess the true method for the

critique of knowledge, that I see it as my life-goal to solve by its means the

main problems of the critique of knowledge one by one - to that end I will

work incessantly, year in and year OUt ,4 An initial sketch of this method can
be found in what are now known as the Seefelder Blatter, dating from the
sununer of 1905. In September of 1906, confident that he now possessed the
tools equal to his task, Husserl referred to the critique of reason as "the general
task that I must accomplish for myself if I am to call myself a philosopher."s
Thus Hussed's sense of philosophical vocation took shape in the first
decade of the twentieth century. The subsequent course of his thought can be
seen as an attempt to fulfill the task he had then envisioned under aegis of the
methodological insight he had acquired midway between the publication of
the Logical Investigations (1900/01), a clarification of the basic concepts of
pure logic by way of descriptive psychology, and Ideas I (1913), a systematic
attempt to introduce transcendental phenomenology as a fundamental
philosophical discipline.
The first public exposition of the motivation, sense, and implications of
Hussed's newly discovered method - called the "phenomenological reduc­
tion," or, alternatively, the "epistemological reduction" was given in five
lectures later published under the title, Die Idee der Phiinomenoiogie. These
lectures were delivered between April 26 and May 2 of 1907 as an introduc­
tion to Husserl's "Dingkolleg," a four-hour lecture course given in the summer
semester of that year and later published as Ding und Raum: Vorlesungen
1907.6 Hussed wrote the "Train of Thought in These Lectures" in the evening
immediately following the presentation of his final lecture. This piece is
included at the end of this volume as a restatement and extension of the
argument given in the five lectures. The original manuscripts M III 9 113a,
4a, 6a, 22a
were edited by Walter Biemel and published as the second
volume of Husserliana in 1950. In 1963 part of Die Idee der Phiinomenologie
was translated into English by William P. Alston and George Nakhnikian so
that it might be included in an anthology they were editing at the time entitled,
Readings in Twentieth Century Philosophy. In 1964 their complete translation
appeared as a separate volume, published by Martinus Nijhoff.
Since the first publication of these lectures in English, the conventions of
Hussed translation developed and solidified as additional works of Hussed
were translated by Dorion Cairns, Fred Kersten, Dallas Willard, John B.
Brough, and others. It became clear that the Idea of Phenomenology should
now be re-translated for the official English language edition of the Collected
Works of Husserl in order to bring it in line with current Husser! translation
practice and to correct the outright mistakes that inevitably afflict fIrst
translation efforts.

In the Third Lecture of the Idea of Phenomenology, Hussed defines
phenomenology as the "science of pure phenomena" (see below, p. 35); in the

ments of the phenomenological critique of knowledge, not to cany out that
critique itself.
To keep these two levels of theoretical inquiry distinct. I will call the level
that deals with the problem of the possibility of knowledge the "critical level";
the level that deals with the problem of the possibility of the knowledge of the
possi bility of knowledge the "meta-critical level." Although distinct, these
levels nonetheless interact: the initial statement of the problem of knowledge
on the critica1level governs the identification and elaboration of the require·
ments on the meta-criticallevel; the work done on

the meta-critical level to

indicate how these requirements will be satisfied in turn leads to a
reformulation of the problem of knowledge on the critical level. The produc·
tive interaction between these two levels inquiry is key to understanding the
progress of the text before us. Husserl"s initial formulation of the problem of
knowledge is broadly Cartesian; the refonnulation is specifically phenome­
nological. Thus the exposition given in these lectures recapitulates

the order

of the discovery: it retraces the steps in the development of Husserl's thought
concerning the problem of knowledge,

and it invites the reader to tread the

same path.

(see below, p. 19) Second, the

version of the eorrespondence relation between act and object, calling upon,
as we shall see, the strict correlation between the real and intentional compo­
nents of knowing.
Both parts of the problem of knowledge are defined by the fact that, in most
cases, our consciousness of objects and the objects of which we are conscious
are

ontologically distinct. They are separated by a gap between two orders of

being. If we

are

to account for the possibility of know ledge, then, we must not

only show how consciousness can go beyond itself and make contact with an
object that is not itself a part of consciousness, we must also be assured that
the object really is "in itself' the way it appears to be in consciousness. But if
things exist independently of our consciousness of them, we can always ask,
as Husserl did, "what do the things themselves care about our ways of
thinking and the logical mles that govern them?" (see below, p. 61) Somehow
we must be in a position to demonstrate an agreement between the two if we
are to account for the possibility of genuine knowledge.
These two problems - transcendence and correspondence

together

constitute the "riddle" of knowledge. HusserI takes the first, the problem of
transcendence, as his initial guide (see below, p. 27). And it immediately leads
him to a recognition of the first requirement for the critical project: the critique
of knowledge must be based upon a form of knowledge that is itself entirely
free of the problem of transcendence. Otherwise, the knowledge of the
possibility of knowledge would be burdened by the very riddle it seeks to
solve. Because of the comprehensive nature of the philosophical problem of
knowledge, HusserI must, of course, be prepared at the outset of his critical
inquiry to make knowledge in general problematic, granting no special
exemptions to any traditionally favored forms of knowledge. But if, after
careful consideration, all forms of knowledge remain problematic, then clearly
the form of knowledge embodied in the critique of knowledge will have no
place to stand. To fulfill the first requirement, HusserI must make a thorough
canvas of the various types of knowledge in hopes of discovering one that is
completely unproblematic on the point of transcendence.
I will call the knowledge to which the problem of transcendence applies
"Type One" knowledge; knowledge free of that problem, if there is any,
"Type Two" knowledge, If all knowledge is of Type One, then the project of
philosophically securing the possibility of Type One knowledge is doomed
from the very outset. Clearly the knowledge represented in the critique of
knowledge must be of a different order than the knowledge for which the
critique is supplied. If the critique of knowledge is to be possible, it needs
leverage; another type of knowledge must be isolated and secured as its basis
for comment on the possibility of Type One knowledge.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

Husserl indicates how this requirement will be satisfied by making the
familiar Cartesian move in Lecture ll: while the knowledge of external objects
is problematic, the knowledge of internal objects is not. Not all knowledge is
saddled with the problem of transcendence.

For in the dire<..1 reflective

apprehension of its own acts, consciousness does not move beyond itself. It
remains within the sphere of immanence. While it is possible to doubt the
validity of our knowledge of objects transcendent to consciousne�s. it makes
no sense to doubt our claims about what is given within the very midst of
consciousness itself. In the former case we can always doubt whether we have
it right; in the latter case, Hussed claims, doubt makes no sense. For here we
have a "sphere of absolute givenness" (see below, p. 26), where what we
claim can be directly measured by what we see, without remainder. Here
consciousness does not go beyond what is immediately given to it.
The rigorous abstention from all knowledge claims involving transcendence
(Type One), and the consequent restriction of the critique of knowledge to
claims concerning the domain of immanence (Type Two), is the "phenome­
nological reduction," the methodological move required for the solution of the
problem of knowledge

as

it is comprehensively posed by philosophy.

After the discovery of sphere of immanence in the reflective apprehension
of the acts of consciousness, Type Two knowledge undergoes two successive
extensions of domain. Both of the extensions

are

motivated by reference to

additional requirements for the critique of knowledge identifieAl at the meta­
critical leveL First, if the critique of knowledge is to be a genuine science, it
must amount to more than a mere collection of reports on particular acts of
consciousness. If it is to issue general claims about the essence of sllch acts,
then essences must also be proper objects of Type Two knowledge. And so
they are, Husserl claims. In a process called "ideating abstraction" - which
Husserl names but does not explain here - the essence of a particular phe­
nomenon can be grasped in a way that makes doubt senseless. "It is senseless
to question and to doubt what the essence of red is ... provided that, while one
is seeing red and grasping it in terms of its specific kind, one means by the
word 'red' exactly what is grasped and seen ... We grasp it - there it is; there
is what we mean, the species red. Could a divine being, an infinite intellect,
do anything more to grasp the essence of red than to see it as a universal?"
(see below, p. 42) If this is indeed the case, then the reflective apprehension
of the acts of consciousness will afford much more than a record of private
mental occurrences; when followed by acts of ideating abstraction it will yield
insights into the very essence of the acts of consciousness and, among them,
the acts of knowing. Statements issued on the basis of such insights into
essence will count as a priori truths, not empirical generalizations over the
regularities of mental life.

6

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

Thus phenomenology will become a science. But it will not be like other
sciences. For the other sciences assume the general validity of Type One
knowledge; that is. they assume the success of transcendence on the part of
consciousness. For them. doubt is always a localized affair, to be resolved by
appeals to other parts of knowledge of the same basic type. But phenomenol­
ogy, as the critique of knowledge, takes the general validity of Type One
knowledge as its explicit theme. Thus it cannot assume the existence of a
world of transcendent objects in causal relation with each other, for it is
precisely this assumption that is put into question by the critique of knowl­
edge. Phenomenology, then, will not try to give a causal account of knowledge
and its connection to the world; it will not seek to explain knowledge as a
"natural fact"; it will not engage in theoretical constructions of the hypotheti­
cal-deductive sort. It cannot borrow from the result" of empirical disciplines;
more pointedly, it cannot be based upon the deliverances of psychology, either
explanatory (as in Wundt), or descriptive (as in Brentano). Nor can it make
use of the speculations of evolutionary biology. Rather, its task is to exhibit
the essence of knowing within the framework of the phenomenological
reduction (see below, p. 41). Thus it must remain entirely a matter of reflec­
tion, direct intuition, analysis, and description.
The fIrst expansion of Type Two knowledge, so as to include not only acts
but essences, will lead Husserl to reformulate the problem of transcendence
as stated on the critical level. The shift from transcendence to immanence was
motivated by the need to locate and secure a type of knowledge not afflicted
by the problem of transcendence. But the admission of the knowledge of
essences into the sphere of Type Two knowledge makes it clear that the
crucial epistemic distinction is not simply between what is external and what
is internal to consciousness in some picturesque sense, but rather what is
inadequateJy given as opposed to what is adequately given. For the issue here
is not location, but indubitability. Knowledge claims are indubitable just in
case they are made on the basis of the adequate givenness of their corre­
sponding objects. An object is adequately given when everything intended in
the knowledge claim has its counterpart in what is intuitively given in the
experience which grounds that claim, when "nothing that is meant fails to be
given" (see below, p. 45). In such cases, Husserl maintains, it makes no sense
to doubt. If, upon the putative perception of a house, I claim to see a house,
my claim goes far beyond what is actually given in the perceptual experience.
What was actually given was a fInite sequence of ostensible house­
appearances, on the basis of which I claimed that I saw a house. But my claim
may be refuted by subsequent experience. As I walk, it may turn out that what
I saw was only a house far;:ade, or a cleverly painted wall of a commercial
establishment, or one phase of a particularly vivid dream sequence. Acts of

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

perception, on the other hand, have no sides. They are given - whole and
entire - in the reflective apprehension I have of them. So, while I may be
deceived regarding the house I apparently perceive; I cannot be deceived,
Husserl will claim here, in my reflective apprehension of the fact that I am
having an apparent house-perception.
This point having been made, there is no reason to think that only items
immanent to consciousness in the real sense can be adequately given, or that
all objects transcendent to consciousness in the sense of being external to it
must be given inadequately. The initial assumption was that the distinction
between immanence and transcendence in the real sense is co-terminous with
the distinction between adequate and inadequate givenness. Thus the phe­
nomenological reduction, in seeking to remove all traces of transcendence in
knowledge, would strictly limit Type Two knowledge to an examination of the
acts of consciousness. But the experience of universals, as Husserl describes
it, shows that this is not the case. Acts of consciousness may be adequately
given by virtue of being immanent to consciousness in the real sense, but this
fact does not preclude the possibility of other kinds of objects being ade­
quately given on other grounds.
This leads Husser! to redefine the distinction between immanence and
transcendence, and thus to reformulate the problem of transcendence on the
critical level. Immanence, in the phenomenologically revised sense, will be
cQrrelated�w�adeq_-g{Yfmlless; tr,!nsc�f!c!�Qc;�.\'{itJ:ljn3:dequate givenness.
Call these revised senses "phenomenological immanence" and "pnen6iiienol­
ogical transcendence." In the case of essences, or, more generally, universals,
we now have entities that are transcendent in the real sense (external to
consciousness) but not in the phenomenological sense (since they can be
wholly given); conversely, they are not immanent in the real sense (since they
are not real parts of consciousness), but they are in the phenomenological
sense (again, because they can be wholly given).
The phenomenological reduction, consistently applied, will have implica­
tions for the status of the knowing subject as well as the known object. It is
one thing to set aside all positing of existence with respect to external objects;
but positing the existence of the subject of knowing, the "I" of the "I think,"
must also be inhibited insofar as that subject is identified as a particular
empirical person inhabiting the transcendent world it knows. Thus, together
with the outward transcendence of physical objects, the "inward transcen­
dence" of the empirical ego annexed to a body that is in tum part and parcel
of the world must fall under the reduction. In this move, the phenomenon of
knowing, then, will be divested of all "psychological apperception" and
thereby rendered "pure" (see below, pp. 33-34). For the special purposes of
the critique of knowledge, consciousness will no longer be construed as a

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

regular inhabitant of the world it takes as its object; it will be referred to as
"pure consciousness" (later: "transcendental consciousness").
This implication of the methodological requirements of the critique of
knowledge, worked out on the meta-critical level, in turn forces another
revision of the formulation of the problem of knowledge on the critical level.
Henceforth the question is not how the psychological phenomenon of knowing
can transcend itself, but how the pure phenomenon of knowing can transcend
itself. Transcendence is no longer the problem of reaching out from the inner
workings of one part of the world to another, but the transcendence of a pure
consciousness to which both the empirical object and empirical subject appear.
The first requirement for the critique of knowledge, the requirement of
Type Two knowledge, motivated the reflective tum to acts of consciousness.
The second requirement for the critique of knowledge - a basis for general
statements motivated the expansion of Type Two knowledge SO as to include
essences. The object domain of Type Two knowledge will now undergo a
second expansion in connection with a third requirement for the critique of
knowledge: that the problem of correspondence become phenomenologically
accessible (see below, pp. 29, 35-36, 55). For if the problem of knowledge is
to receive a phenomenological solution, the relation between the act of
knowing and the object known must be drawn into the sphere of immanence
in the phenomenologically revised sense; it must itself be given, and, as such,
open to direct investigation under the constraints of the reduction. Otherwise,
knowledge claims concerning correspondence, insofar as they posit transcen­
dent relations between acts and objects, will be afflicted by the very problem
they seek to solve.
Husserl addresses this issue in Lecture Five. There he states that while the
physical object which appears is transcendent (in both the real and phenome­
nological sense) to the act of consciousness that apprehends it, the same is not
the case for the appearances of the physical object whereby it presents itself
to consciousness. In phenomenologically reduced experience, these object­
appearances are wholly given. Although they are not a real part of conscious­
ness, thus transcendent in the real sense, they are absolutely given, thus
immanent in the phenomenological sense. This fact provides Husserl with all
the resources he needs for a phenomenological version of the correspondence
theory. The phenomenon of knowing, the act of knowing as given in reflec­
tion, is adequately given. It intentionally contains the systems of appearance
whereby objects, persons, properties, universals, and states of affairs present
themselves to it. For every possible objectivity, there is a corresponding set of
appearances whereby it appears. The correspondence relation is not between
stripped-down acts occurring within a self-enclosed mind and objects external
to it, as we have in Descartes. Consciousness is not like an empty container

TRANSLATOR'S iNTRODUCTION

into which ready-made objects of knowledge, or its representatives, are simply
inserted. Rather. it is a highly complex temporal system of mental processes
by which the givenness of the known object is "constituted." This means that
i n every case of knowledge there is a strict correlation between the real (later
"noetic") and the intentional (later "noematic") components of the act of
knowing, which itself can be wholly given in an act of reflective apprehen­
sion. The task of the phenomenological critique of knowledge, then, is to
identify, analyze, and describe the various ramified systems of presentation
and representation correlated to the various kinds of possible objectivities, and
in so doing, identify the forms of evidence which serve to justify belief in the
existence and determinations of the objectivities so given.
In the Idea of Phenomenology we have only an initial sketch of the
phenomenological research program thus conceived. I n the subsequent Ding
und Raum lectures, to which these five lectures were an introduction, HusserI
pursues in great descriptive detail the manifold correlations involved in our
perceptual awareness of material things in space. In his next major publica­
tion, Ideas I, the plan of the research program will be elaborated with a more
extensive and sophisticated account of the noetic-noematic correlation (Part
1m and complemented by a specifically phenomenological theory of rational­
ity (Part IV) the very project HusserI had envisioned for himself in 1906.
I have represented the progress of thought in the Idea of Phenomenology as
one driven by an interaction between two levels of inquiry, the .critical and the
�!�ritical. On the critical level, the problem of knowledge�was-initialfy
stated in terms HusserI inherited from the tradition of modern philosophy: how
can the acts of knowing, which occur within the mind, reach out and make
contact with Objects wholly external to it; and how can we be sure that they
correspond to the objects they thus encounter? As we saw, once the require­
ments for answering such questions were specified and the conditions of their
satisfaction worked out through several preliminary phenomenological
reflections, the questions themselves were transformed. No longer is it a
matter of how acts, encased in some inner psychological sphere, move beyond
themselves in order to make contact with external objects, but rather how the
givenness of objects is intentionally constituted within a consciousness that
embraces both the givenness of the empirical mind and the empirical world of
which that mind is a part. The questions, thus transformed, can now be
answered on the basis of the resources phenomenology has at its disposal
under the reduction; it need not consult empirical research on the causal
connections between minds and objects, or rely on speculative arguments that
serve as a bridge from the interior of the mind to the great outdoors.
The phenomenological reduction could suggest itself as a viable methodo­
logical procedure for the solution to the problem of knowledge only on the
-

THE iDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

kind of theory of intentionality that Husserl had already adopted in the Logical
Investigations. Theories of intentionality fall into two main categories:

!elati�llitl��!: The relational account takes "intentionality" to refer

to a relation that obtains between two terms - in this case, the act of knowing
and the object known. The nature of this relation, causal or otherwise, is

variously specified. But the main point here is that the relation obtains only
if the two terms of the relation also exist. Just as the relation "taller than"

cannot obtain between me and my brother, unless my brother and I also exist,

so an act of consciousness cannot be intentionally related to an object unless

that object also exists. Those who hold to a relational account of intentionality
must, of course, be in a position to account for the fact that we can think
about, or imagine, non-existent objects; and they are quite naturally tempted

to posit a panoply of objects

called "ideas" in the modern tradition - that

exist inside the mind and serve as the proper objects of those thoughts and

imaginations of things that do not exist outside the mind, thus preserving the
existence condition by positing the "in-existence" of the objects of conscious­

ness. To keep the account consistent, it is often held that the immediate objects
of veridical perceptions

are

also mentally in-existent objects, generated by the

causal powers of physical objects in the neighborhood of the mind. Belief,

then, in the existence of objects transcendent to consciousness will always_
involve a causal inference from the immediately perceived representational

object in the mind to the external object that ostensibly caused it. Such an

inference is, of course, deductively invalid, as David Hume, among others,

was happy to point out, thus intensifying the problem of knowledge based
upon a relational theory of intentionality.

Adverbial theories take intentionality to name not a relation between an act

of consciousness and its object, but rather the property of an act of conscious­
ness whereby it refers to its object. Furthermore, adverbial theories hold that
acts of consciousness have it within their power to refer to objects, even if

those objects do not exist. Husserl clearly beli>!!KS to the adverbial camp. In

"happen also to refer intentionally to objective reality, then that referring is a

characteristic that resides in them, while nothing is thereby assumed concern­

ing the existence or non-existence of reality" (see below, p. 34). Again: "the

relating-itself-to-something-transcendent, to refer to it in one way or another,

is an inner characteristic of the phenomenon" (see below, p. 35). This means

that a phenomenological reduction, which forbids the use of the existence of

objects or their putative causal powers for explanatory purposes, leaves
untouched the resources required for an adequate account of intentionality.

Such an account, unburdened by the problem on transcendence in its own

case, need only describe the internal structure of the acts of consciousness

TRANSLATOR'S I NTRODUCTION

whereby they refer to their objects. If those objects exist, then the acts may
also be said to be in relation to them; but their intentionality does not depen d
upon the existence of the objects to which they refer. A complete account of
intentionality can thus be given with the materials delivered by the reflective
apprehension of the acts of consciousness and their analysis - no appeal need
be made to divine veracity; no hypothetical causal account need be con­
structed. In this approach, HusserI also firmly aligns himself with the
internalist approach to epistemology, which demands that the conditions of
knowledge be accessible from the first person standpoint.
Yet a residual problem remains. It is, ironically, a problem created by the
very adverbial theory of intentionality of consciousness that made phenome­
nology capable of solving the problem of knowledge in the first place. The
problem can best be stated as a point a realist might make: if it is the case that
consciousness can bring it about that a world appear to it independently of the
existence and causal influence of any world, then is it not possible that the
world, in itself, is not at all the way it appears to be to consciousness? We
know that appearances can be deceptive in the local sense. Doesn't HusserI's
theory of intentionality and constitution mean that they can be deceptive in the
global sense as well? (see below, p. 59) The move Husserl made to pull the
correspondence relation into the sphere of immanence seems to leave this
problem unsolved - perhaps even phenomenologically unsolvable.
In Ideas I Husse rI admits that it is logically possible that the world, in itself,
is wholly other than the way it appears to be in consciousness (Ideas I, section
48). There are basically two ways he can handle the skeptical worry at this
point: 1) become an idealist; or, 2) develop a theory of rationality that makes
this possibility untroublesome. If the conflict of interpretations over the
question of whether HusserI was a realist or idealist - still raging today is
any indication, it is fair to say that HusserI explored both of these options. One
is to collapse the object known into the system of its appearances with no
remainder, thus adopting an idealism of a roughly Berkeleyan sort. The other
is to develop a theory of rational doubt that will maintain that while i t is
logically possible for the world to be otherwise than it presents itself in
experience, we would be rationally justified in doubting that it is the way it
appears to consciousness only on the basis of motivations arising from
experience itself. And it is hard to know what these motivations could possibly
be, other than the complete randomization of experience against the b ack­
ground memory of orderly experience.
In my work on this new English version of Husserl's Idee der Phiinome­
nologie, it has been my aim to upgrade the Alston-Nakhnikian translations of
1963 and 1964 in matters of both style and accuracy. On three points I h ave

12

consistently deviated from their translation policy. I have translated Sinn as
"sense" rather than "meaning" (annexing the latter to Bedeutung). I do this t o
disassociate Husserl's concept o f Sinn from exclusively linguistic concerns.
Sinn, for Hussed, is the intentional element of an act of consciousness
whereby that act refers to its object. It is intentionally resident in all acts of
perception, memory, imagination, and the like. As such, it far exceeds in scope
the concerns of the philosophy of language; indeed, for Husserl, it also
precedes those concerns insofar as all linguistic reference is ultimately
founded on pre-predicative acts of consciousness. Second, I have translated
"naturliche Wissenschaften" as the "positive sciences" rather than the "natural
sciences" or "sciences of the natural sort." I do so because the term "natural
sciences" calls to the mind of the English reader such sciences as physics,
chemistry, and biology; whereas Husserl meant by this locution all the
sciences insofar as they are based upon the assumption of the "natural
attitude," the assumption of the existence of the world, the validity of
transcendent experience - that is, all the sciences except the properly philo­
sophical science of phenomenology, which seeks to assess the basic and
pervasive assumption of the positive sciences without participating in it. In his
later writings Husserl himself referred to all such sciences as the "positive
Wissenschciften" (see the Crisis otthe European Sciences and Transcendental
Phenomenology, written in the 1930's, for example). So the use of the English
cognate for this term in a translation of his earlier work would seem permissi­
ble. Third, the term "psychisch" is transliterated by Alston and Nakhnikian as
"psychic," as in "psychic experience," or "psychic data." By this Husserl
means experience or data as they pertain to the mind. But the term "psychic"
calls to the mind of the English-speaking reader images of people with
clairvoyant powers, who regularly invite perfect strangers to chat with them
over the phone about the details of their private lives. To avoid all associations
with the para-normal and occult, I have translated the term "psychisch" as
"mental," "of the mind," and the like.
An additional terminological difficulty is posed by Husserl's use of the term
of "reell" both as an adjective and as an adverb. This term is best explained
by reference to its place in a three-way conceptual partition between the reelle,
the reale, and the intentionale components of an act of consciousness. First,
the contrast between reell and intentionale: in expanding the domain of what
is included in the phenomenon of knowing, Husserl seeks to go beyond the
temporal parts, layers, and phases of an act that actually make it up to those
elements that do not make it up, but are essentially referred to by that act, or
serve as the structural features of the act that make such reference possible.
The former are reelle components of the act, the latter are intentionale parts.
The concept of reelle components receives further definition by reference to

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

13

a second contrast. Under the phenomenological reduction, the acts under
investigation are no longer to be construed as acts within the mind of an
empirical person, part and parcel of the world, but rather as occurring within
a pure consciousness to which that person, as well as the world, appears. Thus
Husserl will use the term

reel! to distinguish those components from reale

components of an act psychologically apperceived as part of the world,
connected, as are all parts of the world, by relations of cause and effect. As a
English translator, I have only the word "real" to work with, unless I want to
resort, as other translators have, to such barbarisms as "really ingredient" aud
the like. My solution is to put the German word

"reell," with its various

adjectival endings, in brackets after the English word "real" every time "real"
is used to translate "reell." This solution is less than elegant; but terminologi­
cal accuracy on this point trumps the claims of felicitous style.
Beyond these shifts in semantic policy,

I have tried to clean up minor errors

in the 1963-64 translations and to conform the style of my own work more
naturally to the syntactic expectations of the English-speaking reader.

If I ha ve

been successful in doing so, it is in large part because of the fine assistance I
received from my former student, Bo-Mi Choi, in her careful and thorough
review of the penultimate draft of my translation. As a native German-speaker,
she served as an invaluable guide to German idiom. Jtirgen Sander reviewed
the Addenda and made several helpful suggestions. Jill Forcier read through
the entire manuscript in search of grammatical mistakes, stylistic glitches, and
typographical errors.
For the translation project as a whole, I

am

indebted to Maja de Keijzer of

Kluwer Academic Publishers for her encouragement and, most of all, her
patience, as my work was in several instances interrupted by unforseen
scholarly opportunities. To Rudolf Bernet of the HusserI-Archives in Louvain,
lowe a great deal of gratitude for his expert advice and comment on the
translation

as

well as my introduction to it.

LECTUREl

[17] 1 In earlier lectures I drew a distinction between positive and philosophical

science. The fonner originates from the natural attitude of the mind, the latter
from the philosophical.

The natu,Ial attitude of the mind is not concerned with the critique of

knowledge.) In such an attitude, our attention is tumed - in acts of intuition and
thought - to things given to us, and given as a matter of course, even though

they are given in different ways and in different modes of being according to

the source and level of our knowledge of them. In perception, for example, a
thing stands before us as a matter of course. It is there, in the midst of other

things, both living and lifeless, animate and inanimate. That is, it stands before
us in the midst of a world, part of which is perceived as particular things are

perceived, part of which is given in connection with memory - from whence
it spreads out into the indeterminate and the unknown. J

It is to this world that our judgments refer. We make statements - some­

times singular, sometimes general - about things: their relations, their

alterations, their functional dependencies and laws of transformation. Thus we
find expression for what presents itself in direct experience. Following up on

motives provided by experience itself, we infer from what is directly experi­

enced in perception and memory to what is not experienced; we generalize;

we apply in turn general knowledge to particular cases, or, in analytical
thought, deduce new generalizations from general knowledge. Pieces of

knowledge do not follow upon one another as a matter of mere succession.

Rather, they enter into logical relations with each other, they follow from each
other, they "agree" with each other, they confmn each other, thereby strength­
ening their logical power.

On the other hand, they also enter into relations of contradiction and strife;

they fail to agree with each other; they are canceled by assured knowledge,

[18] their pretense to knowledge discredited. Perhaps these contradictions

arise from the sphere of laws governing the pure fonns of predication: we

succumbed to equivocation; we drew fallacious inferences; we miscounted or

miscalculated. If this is so, then we will restore formal consistency, resolve the

equivocation, and the like.

Or the contradictions upset the system of motivations that has been

established by experience: grounds for belief provided by experience enter

into conflict with each other. Where do we look for help then? We proceed to

assess the grounds for the various possibilities of detennining or explaining
the matter; the weaker must give way to the stronger, which, for their part,
only hold as long as they stand up, that is, as long as they do not get involved
in a similar logical battle against new epistemic motives introduced by a
broadened sphere of cognition.
This is how positive knowledge makes progress. It takes possession, to an
ever greater degree, of a reality that simply exists and is given as a matter of
course by examining it more closely with respect to its extent, its content, its
elements, relations, and laws. Thus the various positive sciences come into
being and grow - the natural sciences, as sciences of physical and mental
nature, the human sciences, and. on the other hand, the mathematical sciences,
the sciences of numbers, of manifolds, of relations, etc. The latter sciences do
not deal with rea} actualities, but rather with ideal possibilities that are valid
in themselves and, besides that, unquestioned from the very outset

In every step of knowledge taken by the positive sciences, difficulties arise
are resolved, either by pure logic or by an appeal to the f
acts on the basis

and

of impulses or rational motives that lie in the things themselves, that seem to
come from them as

requirements which these things,

as given, impose upon

knowledge.
We will now contrast the natural attitude
of thought, with the philosophical

of thought, or natuml motivations

attitude.

Once reflection on the relation between knowledge and the object is
awakened, abysmal [19] difficulties open up. Knowledge, the thing taken most

for granted in natural thinking, suddenly stands before us as a mystery. But I

must be more exact What is

taken for granted

in natuml thinking is the

possibility of knowledge. Constantly engaged in productive activity, advanc­
ing from discovery to discovery in newly developed sciences, natural thinking
finds no occasion to raise the question of the possibility of knowledge as such.
To be sure,

knowledge

becomes a problem for it in a

certain wa)"

as does

everything else that occurs in the world: it becomes an object of positive
research. Knowledge is a natuml state of affairs; it is the experience of some
knowing organic being; it is a psychological fact. And like any psychological
fact, it can be described with respect to its kinds and forms of interconnection;
its genetic relations can be investigated.

On

the other hand, knowledge is,

knowledge ofobjectivity, and it is such by virtue of
the sense that is immanent to it, the sense by which it relates itself to objectiv­

according to its essence,

ity. And natural thinking also deals with such relations. As an object for
investigation, it takes, in their

fonnal

genemlity, the a priori connections

priori laws that belong to
such; it gives rise to a pure grammar and, at a higher level, a

between meanings and meaning-validities, the a
objectivity as

pure logic (which yields a whole complex of disciplines by virtue of its

LECTURE

I

17

various possible delimitations), and again to a normative and practical logic
as

an art of thinking, especially scientific thinking.

Thus far, however, we still stand on the ground of natural thinking.2

But it is precisely this correlation between epistemic experience, meaning,

and object - touched upon here for the sake of c ontrasting the psychology of

knowledge and pure logic with ontology - that represents the source of the

deepest and most difficult problems, which, taken together, comprise the

problem of the possibility of knowledge.

[20rIn

all of its manifestations, knowledge is a mental experience:

knowledge belongs to a knowing subject. The known objects stand over

against it.IHow, then, can knowledge be sure of its agreement with the known

objects? How can knowledge go beyond itself and reach its objects reliably?
What appears to natural thinking as the matter-of-fact givenness of known

objects within knowledge becomes a riddlefIn perception, the perceived

object is supposed to be immediately given. There stands the thing before my

perceiving eyes. I see it; I grasp it. But the perception is nothing more than an

experience that belongs to me, the perceiving subject. Likewise, memory and

expectation

are

subjective experiences, along with all the acts of thought built

upon them, on the basis of which we mediately posit real existence and

determine any

know

truth

about such existenceJ How do I, the knowing subject,

and how can I know for sure - that �ot only my experiences, these acts

of knowing, exist, but also what they know exists? Indeed, how do I know that
there is anything at all that can be set over against knowledge as an object?

Should I say: only phenomena are genuinely given to the knowing subject,

and the knowing subject never gets beyond the interconnections of its own

experiences. Thus it can only be truly justified in saying: I exist, and every­
thing that is not me is mere phenomena, resolves itself into phenomenal

contexts. Should I adopt, then, the standpoint of solipsism? This is a hard and

exacting demand. Should L with Hume, reduce all transcendent objectivity to
mere fictions, which can be explained by means of psychology, but not

rationally justified? But that too is a hard and exacting demand. Does not

Hume's psychology, like any psychology, transcend the sphere of imma­

nence? When it uses such terms as "custom," "human nature," "sense organs,"

"stimulus," and the like, is it not dealing with entities that - by its own
admission - enjoy a transcendent existence, even while its aim is to degrade
everything that transcends actual "impressions" and "ideas" to the level of

fiction?3

But what is the use of appealing to contradictions, if [21]

THE IDEA O F PHENOMENOLOGY

lawfulness, which natural thought would not dream of questioning, now
becomes questionable and even dubious. Biological lines of thought now
crowd in upon us. fv.re are reminded of the modern theory of evolution,
according to which man has developed through the struggle for existence and
the process of natural selection, and with him, of course, also his intellect, and
with the intellect the forms that belong to it, especially the logical formsJoo
not logical forms and logical laws, then, simply express the contingent
peculiarities of the human species? But couldn' t they have been different?
And won't they become different in the course of future evolution? Knowl­
edge, then, is just human knowledge, bound to the forms of the human
intellect, incapable of making contact with the very nature of things, with the
things themselves.
But here again an absurdity immediately leaps to the fore: does the
knowledge with which such a view operates, or even the possibilities, which
it considers, make any sense if the laws of logic are given over to such
relativism? Does not the truth that there is this possibility, or that possibility,
implicitly presuppose the absolute validity of the principle of non­
contradiction, according to which a given truth excludes its contradictory?
These examples should suffice. The possibility of knowledge has become
a riddle in every respect. If we immerse ourselves in the positive sciences, we
fmd, to the degree they have developed into exact sciences, everything clear
and intelligible. We are sure that we are in possession of objective truth, which
has been grounded through reliable methods that actually make contact with
objectivity. But as soon as we engage in reflection, we fall into error and
confusion. We get involved in patently untenable positions, even in contradic­
tions. We are in constant danger of falling into skepticism, or worse yet, into
any one of the forms of skepticism that have, unfortunately, one and the same
characteristic: absurdity.
The playground of these obscure and contradictory theories, as well as the
endless [22] controversies associated with them, is �ol!!JD: a�_�
l!!!J§ics for metaphysics is bound up with epistemology boi.flhistoocally and
by way of the subject matter. The task of epistemology, or the critique of
theoretical reason, is first of all a critical one. It must expose and reject the
mistakes that natural reflection upon the relation between knowledge, its
sense, and its object almost inevitably makes; and it must thereby refute the
explicit or implicit skeptical theories concerning the essence of knowledge by
demonstrating their absurdity.
On the other hand, its positive task is to solve the problems pertaining to the
correlation of knowledge, its sense, and its object by inquiring into the essence
of knOWledge. Among these problems is the problem of explicating the
essence and sense of knowable objectivity, or what amounts to the same thing,

LECTURE I

19

objectivity i n general: the sense, that i s , which is prescribed a priori (essen­
tially) to objectivity by virtue of the correlation between knowledge and its
object. And this, of course, pertains to all of the basic forms of objectivity as
they are predelineated by the essence of knowledge. (The ontological forms,
as well as the apophantic and metaphysical.)
It is precisely through the successful execution of these tasks that episte­
mology qualifies as a critique of knowledge, or, more exactly, as a critique of
positive knowledge within all the positive sciences. It thus puts us in the
position of being able to give an accurate and definitive interpretation of the
results of the positive sciences with respect to what exists. For the epistemo­
logical confusion in which we are placed by natural (pre-epistemological)
reflection on the possibility of knowledge (on the possibility of knowledge
making contact with its object) i s predicated not only upon false views about
the essence of knowledge, but also upon self-contradictory, and therefore
fundamentally misleading, interpretations of being as it is known in the
positive sciences. Thus one and the same natural science is interpreted in
materialistic, spiritualistic, dualistic, psycho monistic, positivistic, and many
other ways, depending upon what interpretation is thought to be the necessary
conclusion of such reflections. Q!!!L�PE!�mological reflection yields the

IT we then disregard the metaphysical purposes of the critique of �ge
and attend solely to its task of clarifying the essence ofknowledge and known

which forms the first and fundamental part of phenomenology in general.
Phenomenology: this teon designates a science, a complex of scientific disciplines; but it also designates at the same time and above all a method and
an attitude of thought: the specifically philosophical attitude of thought, the
specifically philosophical method.
In contemporary philosophy, insofar as it claims to be a serious science, it
has almost become a commonplace that there can be but one method for
acquiring knowledge in all the sciences, including philosophy. This conviction
is in complete accordance with the great traditions of the philosophy of the
17th century, which also held that the salvation of philosophy depends upon
its taking the exact sciences - especially mathematics and mathematical

OF PHENOMENOLOGY

as the methodological modeL This posited methodological

parity between philosophy and the other sciences goes hand in hand with
positing a parity in their subject matter as welL Even today one must still
reckon with the prevailing opinion that philosophy, more specifically, the
overarching theory of being and science, can not only be related to all the
other sciences, but can also be grounded on their findings [24] in the same
way that the sciences are grounded upon each other, the conclusions of one
serving as the premi ses for others. Here I remind the reader of the favorite
ploy of grounding epistemology on a psychology of knowledge or on biology.
In our day, reactions against these fatal prejudices are frequent. And preju­
dices they are indeed.
In the sphere of positive research, one science can readily build upon
another and one can serve the other as a methodological model, although only
to a certain extent determined and limited by the nature of the areas of
research in question. Philosophy, however, lies in a wholly new dimension. It
requires a wholly new point of departure and

a

wholly new method, a method

that distinguishes it in principle from every "positive" science. This is why the
logical procedures that lend a unity to the positive sciences, in spite of the
specialized methods that differ from science to science, have an essentially
unitary character in contrast to the methodological procedures of philosophy,
which constitute, in principle, a new unity. This is also why the pure philoso­
phy within the whole critique of knowledge and the "critical" disciplines in
general must disregard and refrain from making any use of the entire intellec­
tual achievement of the positive sciences as well as natural wisdom and lore
(which are not organized as a science).
By way of anticipation, this doctrine, which will be given a more detailed
and exact grounding in subsequent remarks, is suggested by the follo\Ving
consideration.
In the skeptical mood necessarily created by critical epistemological
reflection (here I mean the initial reflection that occurs within the natural
mode of thought and thus precedes any scientific critique of knowledge),
every positive science and every positive scientific method ceases to count as
an available possession. For here the ability of knowledge to make contact
with an object has become enigmatic and even dubious in its very sense and
possibility - and here exact knowledge is no less enigmatic than non-exact
knowledge, scientific no [25] less than prescientific. What becomes question­
able is the possibility of knowledge, more precisely, the possibility of
knowledge making contact with an objectivity that is, after all, what it is in
itself. At bottom, what knowledge accomplishes, the sense of its claim to
validity or justification, th e sense of the distinction between valid knowledge
and knowledge that merely makes a pretense to validity, is in question; as is,

LECTURE

I

21

o n the other side, the sense of objectivity, which i s and i s what it i s whether
it is known or not, and yet as an objectivity is an objectivity of a possible
knowledge, in principle knowable even if it has as a matter of fact never been
known or will be knovm, in principle perceivable, imaginable, and detenni n­
able by predicates in a possible judgment, etc.
It is impossible to see, however, how operating with assumptions drawn
from positive knowledge, no matter how "exactly grounded" they are in it, can
assist us in resolving the doubts generated by the critique of knowledge, or
solve its problems. IT the very sense and value of positive knowledge as such,
with all its methodological arrangements, with all its exact groundings, has
become problematic, then this effects every principle drawn from the sphere
of positive knowledge that might be taken as a point of departure as well as
every ostensibly exact method of grounding. The most rigorous forms o f
mathematics and mathematical natural science here have not the slightest
advantage over any actual or alleged knowledge belonging to common
experience. Thus it is clear that there can be no talk of philosophy (which
begins with the critique oCknowledge and remains entirely rooted in such a
critique) orienting itself to the exact sciences methodologically (or even with
respect to its subject matter!), or taking the method of the exact sciences as a
model, or that it is the task of philosophy to extend and perfect the work
accomplished in the exact sciences according to a method that is essentially
the same for all the sciences. In comparison to all positive "�Sl�e_�,

character and authority.

LECTURE ll

[29] At the outset of the critique of knowledge, then, the entire world

physical and psychological nature, and ultimately one 's own human ego,

together with all the sciences that deal with such objectivities - must be
assigned the index of dubitability. Its being, its validity, remains undecided.
Now the question is: how can the

critique of knowledge establish itself? As

the scientific self-understanding of knowledge, it seeks to determine scientifi­

cally, and thus objectively, what the essence of knowledge is and what it
means to say that i t i s related to an objectivity, and that it i s objectively valid

or correct in those cases where it is to count as genuine knowledge. Although
the

epoche

which the critique of knowledge must exercise - begins by

placing all knowledge in question, it cannot continue to do so in the case of its
own knowledge; and although it initially deprives all givenness of its validity,

it cannot continue to do so in the case of the givenness it has itself established.

If it cannot presuppose anything as pregiven, then it must begin with some

knowledge that it does not take unexamined from other sources, but rather
provides for itself and posits as primary.

This primary knowledge may not contain anything that bespeaks of the

unclarity and dubitability that otherwise lends to knowledge the character of
being enigmatic and problematic so that we are finally put in the embarrassing

position of having to say that all knowledge as such is a problem, something

that is incomprehensible, in need of clarification and doubtful in all its claims.

In terms of the correlate of knowledge, we may put it this way: if we are
allowed to take no being as pregiven because the lack of epistemological

clarity entails that we do not understand what it could mean for a being to be

known in itself and yet

be

known in knowledge,

then it must be possible to

point out some being that we must without doubt

[30] acknowledge as

absolutely given insofar as it is given with complete c larity, on the basis of

which every question about it must and will find its immediate answer.

And now we recall the Cartesian doubt. Reflecting on the manifold

deIUsioi1,l�htfaii into such a state of skeptical

possibilities of error and

doubt that I finally say: I am certain of nothing, for me everything is doubtful.

But as soon as I say that, it becomes evident that not everything can be
doubtful for me. For in making the j udgment that everything is doubtful it

cannot be doubted that I am making this judgment. For this reason it would be
absurd to persist in universal doubt. In every case of determinant doubt it is

without doubt certain that I am so dOUbting. The same is true of every

cogitatio.

However I might perceive, imagine, judge, infer - whether these

23

24

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

acts are attended by certainty or uncertainty, whether they actually have
objects or not - it remains absolutely clear and certain that with respect to
perception I am perceiving this or that, that with respect to judgment, I am
jUdging this or that, etc.
Descartes made use of this consideration for other purposes; but with the
appropriate modifications we can use it here as well.
If we make an inquiry into the essence of knowledge, no matter what the
status of our doubt concerning its ability to make genuine contact with
objectivity may be, or the status of that ability itself, it is still the case that
knowledge is the title for a highly ramified sphere of being that can be given
to us absolutely, and must be absolutely given to us in its details at any
particular time. So, those forms of thought that I actually realize in thinking
are given to me insofar as I reflect on them, accept them and posit them in a
pure act of seeing. In a vague way I can talk about knowledge, perception,
imagination, experience, judgment, inference, and the like. When I reflect,
then, of course, only the phenomenon of such vague "talking about and
referring to knowledge, experience, judgment, etc." is given. But it is
nonetheless given absolutely. Even the phenomenon of vagueness takes its
place under the title of knowledge in the broadest sense. But I can also
actually carry out at) act of perception and tum my regard to it. Furthermore,
I can represent a perception to myself in imagination or in memory and tum
my regard to its givenness within imagination. Then it is for me no longer [31]
a matter of empty talk or vague opinion, a mere idea of perception. Rather,
perception stands right before my eyes, as it were, as something given, either
actually or by way of imagination. The same holds for every intellectual
experience, for every form of thinking and knowing.
Here I have treated the reflective seeing within perception and imagination
as equivalent. If we were following the Cartesian meditation, perception
would have been emphasized first; to some degree it corresponds to the so­
called inner perception of traditional epistemology, though this is, admittedly,
an ambiguous concept.

Every intellectual experience, indeed every experience whatsoever. can be
made into an object ofpure seeing and apprehension while it is occurring.
And in this act of seeing it is an absolute givenness. It is given as an existing

entity, as a "this-here." It would make no sense at all to doubt its being. To be
sure, I can wonder what sort of being this is, and how this mode of being is
related to other modes. Furthermore, I can wonder what givenness means here,
and can, upon a further act of reflection, see this act of seeing itself, the act in
which this givenness, or this mode of being, constitutes itself. But here I am
all the while moving on absolute ground: the perception, as long as it lasts, is
and remains an absolute entity, a "this-here," that is what it is in itself,

LECTURE I I

25

something that I can refer to as a final criterion in determining what being and
being-given might mean, and here must mean, at least for the manner of being
and givenness exemplified by the "this-here." And this holds for all specific
forms of thought, no matter how they are given. They can also be given in
imagination; they can stand "as it were" before our eyes, and yet not be there
as presently existing actualities, as actually occurring perceptions, judgment,
etc. But even then they are in a certain sense given. They stand before us as
objects of intuition. We speak of them not in vague and sketchy terms, or by
way of empty opinion. Rather, we see them, and, as we are seeing them, we
can examine their essence, their constitution, their immanent character and
confonn our talk by a pure measure to what is seen in the fullness of its
clarity. All this, however, must be [32] supplemented by a discussion of the
concept of essence and the knowledge of essence.
For the moment, we maintain that a sphere of absolute givenness can be
indicated at the very outset. And it is precisely this sphere that we need if it i s
t o b e possible for u s t o envision a theory o f knowledge. Indeed, our lack of
clarity with regard to the sense or essence of knowledge requires a science of
knowledge, a science that dedicates itself solely to getting clear on the essence
of knowledge. It will not explain knowledge as a psychological fact; it will not
investigate the natural conditions under which acts of knowledge come and
go, or the natural laws by which they originate and change. To investigate
such things is the task that a positive science sets for itself, the natural science
of mental facts, of the experiences of the individual minds that undergo them.
Rather, the critique of knowledge seeks to clarify, to bring to light, the essence
of knowledge and the legitimacy of its claim to validity, a claim that belongs
to its essence. And what else can this mean than to bring the essence of
knowledge to direct self-givenness?
Recapitulation and Amp..!JJi£a]i2n . In its constant progress from one success
to anotnerIfifue varlOilSsciences, positive knowledge is entirely confident in
its ability to make contact with objectivity and has no occasion to worry about
the possibility of knowledge and the sense of known objectivity. But as soon
as reflection is directed upon the correlation between knowledge and obj ectiv­
ity (and eventually upon the ideal meaning-content on the one side, and known
objectivity on the other) difficulties, untenable positions, and conflicting but
seemingly well-grounded theories abound. This forces us to admit that the
possibility of knowledge, with regard to its ability to make contact w ith
objectivity, is a riddle.
A new science, the critique of knowledge, is called for here. Its task is to
resolve these conf�slo�s and cl:rrify f()r-us-the essence of knowledge. The
possibility of metaphysics, as a science of being in the absolute and final
sense, depends upon the success of this science. But how [33] can such a

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

26

science of knowledge establish itself? For a science cannot use as a pregiven
foundation what it places in question. But all knowledge is put in question
here, since the critique of knowledge takes as its problem the possibility of
knowledge as such and its ability to make contact with objectivity. Once it
begins, no knowledge can count for it as simply given. Thus it may not take
over anything from the sphere of pre-scientific knowledge. All knowledge
bears the index of dubitability.
With no knowledge given at the beginning, however, it is impossible to
make progress in knowledge. Thus the critique of knowledge cannot begin.
There can be no such science at all.
At this point I suggested that this is true in that no knowledge can, at the
beginning, count as pregiven without examination. However, even if the
critique of knowledge cannot take over any knowledge at the outset, it can
nonetheless begin by giving itself knowledge - not knowledge it grounds upon
or logically derives from immediate knowledge that must already be given.
Rather, what is required is knowledge that the critique of knowledge can
immediately point out and which is of such a sort that it precludes every doubt
concerning its possibility and

- ��gg_ ab§g}llt�1y_ cle'!f�.d.jgQ.�aEl�-

contains nothing enigmatic that might provide the occasion for all the
skeptical confusions. I then referred to Cartesian doubt and to the sphere of
absolute givenness, that is, to the circle of absolute knowledge, which is
comprehended under the title of the evidence of the cogitatio. It now remains
to be shown in more detail that the immanence of this knowledge means that
it can serve as an appropriate point of departure for the critique of knowledge;
furthermore, that because of such immanence, this form of knowledge is free
of that enigmatic character which is the source of all skeptical predicaments;
and, finally, that immanence is the necessary mark of all knowledge that

comprises the critique of knowledge, and that any borrowing from the sphere
of the transcendent, any attempt to ground epistemology on psychology, or
any positive science, is nonsense not only at the start but at any point along the
way.
By way of amplification, I add the following: there is an apparently sound
argument [34] to the effect that epistemology cannot get underway because it
places knowledge as such in question and so must place any knowledge with
which it begins in question as well. If all knowledge is a riddle to epistemol­
ogy, then so is the first piece of knowledge with which it commences. I
maintain that this apparently sound argument is but a deception. The deception
arises from the vague generality of the language. What is "placed in question"
is knowledge in general. But that is not to deny that there is any knowledge at
all - for that would lead to an absurdity. Rather, it is to say that knowledge
contains within itself a certain problem, namely, how it is possible for it to

LECTURE 11

27

achieve what we usually take it to achieve: contact with objectivity. I may
even doubt that such an achievement is possible. But doubt as I may, a first
step can be taken when the doubt is canceled by the fact that I can point to
certain kinds of knowledge that render such doubt pointless. Although i t is
true, moreover, that if I begin by not understanding knowledge at all, then this
lack of understanding embraces all knowledge in its indeterminate generality,
this does not mean that every instance of knowledge that I come upon in the
future must forever remain incomprehensible. It may be that a great riddle
accompanies that class of knowledge which initially crowds to the fore, and
that I am compelled to say, with some embarrassment, that knowledge as such
is a riddle. But then it may soon afterwards become apparent that this riddle
does not inhabit certain other kinds of knowledge. As a matter of fact, this is
the case, as we shall soon see.
I said that the knowledge with which the critique of knowledge must begin
may not contain anything that can be questioned or doubted, anything that
throws us into epistemological confusion and thus gives rise to the critique of
knowledge in the first place. We must show that this holds for the sphere of
the cogitatio. But this will require a deeper going reflection, one that will
afford us essential advantages.
If we take a closer look at what is so enigmatic about knowledge, and what
causes our predicament in our fIrst reflections on the possibility of knowledge,
we fInd that it is its transcendence. All positive knowledge, prescientifIc and
even more so scientifIc, is knowledge that takes its objects as transcendent;

[35] it posits objects as existing, and claims to make cognitive contact with

states of affairs that are not "in the genuine sense given" in it, not "immanent"
to it.
Upon closer examination, this � turns out to be ambiguous. It
can refer to the fact that the known object is not really [reell] contained in the
act of knowing. In this case, "given in the genuine sense" or "immanently
given" would be understood in terms of real [reelle] containment: the ac t of
knowing, the cogitatio, has real [reelle] moments that really [reell] constitute
it; but the thing to which it refers and which it ostensibly perceives, remem­
bers, and the like, is to be found in the cogitatio itself as an experience not
really [reell] as a part, as something that actually exists inside it. Thus the
question is: how can experience, so to speak, go beyond itself? Here "imma­

nent " means "really [reell] immanent to the experience of knowing. "
But there is another sense of transcendence, whose counterpart is an
entirely different kind of immanence, namely, absolute and clear givenness,
self-give/mess in the absolute sense. This givenness, which excludes any
meaningful doubt, consists of an immediate act of seeing and apprehending
the meant objectivity itself as it is. It constitutes the precise concept of

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

28

evidence, understood as immediate evidence. All knowledge that is not
evident, that refers to or posits what is objective, but

does not see itfor itself,

is transcendent in this second sense. In such knowledge we go beyond what
is given in the genuine sense, beyond what can be directly seen and appre­
hended. Here the question is: how can knowledge posit something as existing
that is not directly and genuinely given in it?
Before critical epistemology enters into deeper levels of reflection, these
two senses of immanence and transcendence are initially interwoven with each
other in a confused fashion. Clearly those who bring up the first question of
the possibility of real transcendence in fact also bring the second question into
play, the question concerning the possibility of transcendence beyond the
sphere of evident givenness. But they are implicitly supposing that the only
actually comprehensible, unquestionable, absolutely evident givenness is that
of a

moment really [reell] contained in

the act of knowing.

[36]

Thus they

regard everything about the known objectivity that is not really

[reel!]

contained in it as enigmatic, problematic. But we shall soon see that this i s a
fatal mistake.
Now one may understand transcendence in one or the other sense, or one
may initially take it in its ambiguous sense, but transcendence remains both
the initial and the guiding problem for the critique of knowledge. It is the
riddle that stands in the way of positive knowledge and the impulse behind
these new investigations. One could at the outset characterize the task of
critique of knowledge as one of providing a solution to the problem of
transcendence, thereby giving this new discipline its preliminary delimitation,
instead of giving a more general characterization of its theme as the problem
of the essence of knowledge as such.
At any rate, if the riddle connected with the i nitial establishment of this
discipline lies here, then we can determine more exactly what cannot be
claimed as pregiven. Nothing transcendent may be utilized as pregiven.

I also do not know whether it is possible.

The scientific validation of the transcendent existence of something is of no
assistance to me anymore. For all mediate validation is ultimately based upon
i mmediate validation, and the riddle is already contained in what is immediate.
Yet someone might say: "That mediate as well as immediate knowledge
contain the riddle is certain. But it is only the how that is puzzling, whereas the

that is absolutely certain. No

sensible person will doubt the exi stence of the

world; besides, the skeptic betrays himself by his practice." Very well, then
we will answer this person with a stronger and more far-reaching argument.
For this argument will not only show that one may have no recourse to the
content of the positive sciences, which take their obj ects to be transcendent,

LECTURE

II

29

at the beginning of epistemology, but that one may have no such recourse
throughout its entire development. Thus it proves the fundamental thesis that
epistemology can never be built upon a positive science of any kind. Hence we

ask: what will our opponent propose to do with his transcendent knowledge?
We put at his disposal the entire stock of transcendent truths belonging to the
objective [37] sciences, and we leave their truth value unaltered by the
emergence of the riddle concerning the possibility of transcendent science.
Now what wilt he propose to do with his all-embracing knowledge? How does
he think he will get from the ''that'' to the "how"? The fact that he knows that
transcendent knowledge is actual guarantees for him as logically obvious the
fact that transcendent knowledge is possible. But the riddle is how it is
possible. Can he solve this riddle by assuming afl theScIeiiCes�Oroypresup::­
poslng'iiil or any transcendent knowledge? Let us consider: what more does
he really need? He takes the possibility of transcendent knowledge for
granted, even as analytically obvious, since, as he says to himself, in my case
there is knowledge of the transcendent. What he lacks is wholly apparent.1
What is unclear to him is the relation to transcendence; what is unclear is the
"contactwith a traU:-Sce�de�t'� 'that-i� ��ribedtokllowledge,to-lffiOWini­
wh�owwoufdhe achieve CiariiY oll.tlsll polntHYtily inlii�-essenC'e- of
this relation is somewhere given to him, so that he could see it, so that the
unity of knowing and the known object, which is suggested by the phrase
"making contact with objectivity" [Triftigkeit], would itself stand right before
his eyes. Then he would not only have knowledge about its possibility, rather
this possibility would be clearly given to him. But for him this possibility is
itself something transcendent, a known possibility, but not a possibility that
is given and seen. Apparently his thought is this: knowing is something other
than the known object; knowing is given, but the known object is not given;
and yet knowing is supposed to relate to the object, to know it. How can I
understand this possibility? Naturally the answer is: I could only understand
it if the relation itself could be given, as something that can be seen. But if the
obj ect is and remains something transcendent, and if knowing and the obj ect
are actually separate, then surely he can see nothing here, and his hopes for
finding a way to somehow achieve clarity by drawing conclusions from
transcendent presuppositions are obviously foolish. [38]
As a consequence of this line of thought, he would also have to give up his
starting point: he would have to acknowledge that, in this situation, knowledge
of the transcendent is impossible, and that his alleged knowledge of the
transcendent is a mere prejudice. Then the problem is no longer how transcen­
dent knowledge is possible, but rather how to explain the prejudice that

1

See Addendum III.

30

T H E IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

ascribes a transcendent accomplishment to knowledge. This is the way Hume
took.
Disregarding that approach, we will illustrate the fundamental notion that
the problem of "how" (how transcendent knowledge is possible, or, more
generally, how knowledge as such is possible) can never be solved on the
basis of pregiven knowledge concerning what is transcendent, or from
pregiven principles of such knowledge, taken from anywhere, even from the
exact sciences, by adding the following consideration: a person born deaf
knows that there are tones, that harmonies are based on tones, and that a
splendid art is derived from them. But such a person cannot understand how
tones do such a thing, or how tonal works of art are possible. Such a person
couldn't even imagine them, that is, couldn't see them and in seeing them
apprehend how they are possible. Knowledge of existence would be of no help
here; and it would be absurd to propose to deduce the "how" of music, to
clarify its possibilities, by way of inference from such knowledge. It will not
do to draw conclusions from the existence of things one merely knows but
does not see. Seeing cannot be demonstrated or deduced. It is a manifest piece
of nonsense to try to clarify possibilities (and immediate possibilities at that)
through a logical derivation from non-intuitive knowledge. I may be wholly
certain that there are transcendent worlds; I may grant full validity to the
content of all the positive sciences. But I cannot borrow anything from them.
I should never imagine that I can get to where I want to go in the critique of
knowledge by way of transcendent suppositions and scientific inferences
namely, to be able to envision the possibility of the transcendent objectivity
of knowledge. And that holds not only for the beginning of the critique of
knowledge, but for its entire development. so long as it sticks to the problem
of clarifying � kn�wle�ljLJ!Q!sible. And that holds not just for the
.
problem of transcendent objectivity, but fOi=tl1e clarification of any possibility.
If we combine with this the extraordinarily strong tendency to j udge in a
transcendent sense wherever a transcendently directed act of thought occurs
and a judgment is to be based upon such an act, thus falling into a J.1€'Capcwt�
Ei� &.U.o yevo� then we can give a sufficient and complete deduction of the
following §l!.!!.!l!.'flC!!:g.giEal principle: in every epistemological investigation,
into whatever type of � the epistemological reduction must be
performed, that is, all transcendence that comes into play here must be
excluded, must be supplied with the index of indifference, of epistemological
nullity, with an index that says: the existence of all transcendent entities,
whether I believe in them or not, does not concern me here; this is not the
place to pass judgment on the issue, to do so is entirely beside the point.
All of the basic errors in epistemology are connected to the above men­
tioned IlE'tapaO\� on the one hand, the error of psychologism, and on the

LECTURE II

31

other, the error of anthropologism and biologism. This llecti�a<Hs is
exceedingly dangerous, partly because the proper sense of the problem is
never made clear and remains totally lost in it, and partly because even those
who have gotten clear on the problem find it very difficult to hang onto this
clarity and, in subsequent thought, easily slip back into the temptations of the
natural modes of thinking and j udging as well as those false and misleading
formulations of the problem which grow on their basis.

LECTURE III

[43] By the foregoing considerations we have determined precisely and
reliably what the critique of knowledge may and may not use. While its riddle
is the possibility of transcendence, it may never under any conditions draw the
actuality of what is transcendent into its account. The sphere of usable
objectivities, of usable knowledge, which present themselves as valid and
remain free of the marks of epistemological vacuity, however, does not reduce
itself to zero. For we have secured the entire sphere of cogitationes. The being
of the

cogitatio

-

more precisely, the phenomenon of knowledge itself - is

beyond question and free of the riddle of transcendence. Such existences are
already presupposed in the initial statement of the problem of knowledge. The
question of how the transcendent enters into knowledge would surely forfeit
its sense if not only the transcendent but also knowledge itself were given up.
It is also clear that cogitationes present a sphere of absolutely immanent
givenness, whatever else we might mean by "immanence. In the seeing of the
"

pure phenomenon the object is not external to knowledge, or to "conscious­
ness"; rather, it is given in the sense of the absolute self-givenness of what is
simply seen.
But this point needs to be secured by the

epistemological reduction, the
in concreto for

methodological essence of which we now propose to examine

the first time. We need this reduction in order not to confuse the evidence of
the being of the

cogitatio with the evidence for existence of my cogitatio, the
sum cogitans and the like. We must guard ourselves against
this fundamental confusion between the pure phenomenon in the phenomenol­
ogical sense and the psychological phenomenon, the object of psychology as

evidence of the

a positive science. If I, as one thinking in the natural mode. consider the
perception I am presently undergoing, [44] I apperceive it immediately and
almost unavoidably (as a matter of fact) in relation to my ego. It stands there
as an experience of this experiencing person, as this person's state, as its act;
the sensory content stands there

as

content that is given, sensed, and recog­

nized by this person, and integrates itself within the perception of objective
time. Perception, or any

cogitatio, thus apperceived is a psychological fact.

Thus it is apperceived

a datum in objective time, belonging to the experi­

as

encing ego, the ego that is in the world and endures for a time (a time

that is

measured by empirically calibrated instruments). Thus it is a phenomenon in
keeping with the sense of the positive science we call psychology.
The phenomenon in this sense falls under the law to which we must subject
ourselves in the critique of knowledge, the law of the

33

epoch!? in relation to

34

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

everything transcendent. The ego as a person, as a thing belonging to the
world, and experience as the experience of this person
even if entirely
indeterminant - exist in the order of objective time: they are all transcendent
and, as such, epistemologically null. Only through a reduction, which we shall
call the phenomenological reduction, do I acquire an absolute givenness that
no longer offers anything transcendent. If I place the ego and the world and
the experience of the ego as such in question, then reflection upon what is
given in the apperception of the relevant experience, upon my ego
a
reflection that simply "sees" - yields the phenomenon of this apperception: the
phenomenon, roughly, of "perception apprehended as my perception." Of
course, I can also refer this phenomenon to my ego in the mode of natural
reflection, and posit this ego in the empirical sense by saying: I have this
phenomenon, it is mine. If I then wanted to acquire the pure phenomenon, I
would again have to place the ego as well as time and the world in question,
thereby bringing out a pure phenomenon, the pure cogitatio. But while I am
perceiving I can also regard this perception itself in an act of pure seeing, just
as it is, ignoring its relation to the ego, or abstracting from that relation. The
perception thus grasped and delimited in "seeing" is then an absolute
perception, devoid of every transcendence, given as a pure phenomenon in the
phenomenological sense. [45]

If it is now possible to take such pure phenomena as objects for research,
it is evident that we are no longer doing psychology, a positive science that
takes its objects to be transcendent. We are not making an investigation of
psychological phenomena, of certain occurrences in so-called real reality
(whose existence remains in question throughout), nor do we speak of them.
Rather, we are investigating what exists and remains valid whether anything
like objcctive reality exists or not, whether the positing of such transcendence
is justified or not. We speak then of just those things that are absolutely given;
if they happen also to refer intentionally to objective reality, then that referring
is a characteristic that resides in them, while nothing is thereby assumed
concerning the existence or non-existence of reality. And thus we drop anchor
on the shore of phenomenology, whose objects are posited as existing, as any
science posits the existence of the objects it investigates, but not as existing
in an ego, in a temporal world, but rather as entities absolutely given and
grasped in pure immanent seeing: what is purely immanent here is first of all

LECTURE III

35

to be characterized through the phenomenological reduction; I mean precisely
what is immanent, not what it refers to beyond itself, but rather what it is in
itself and what it is given as. This discussion is, of course, only a roundabout
way of helping us to see what is to be seen here, namely, the distinction
between the quasi-givenness of transcendent objects and the absolute
givenness of the phenomenon itself.
Additional steps, additional considerations, are necessary, however, i f we
are to gain a fIrm footing on this new land and not, in the end, run aground on
its shore. For this shore [46] has its share of rocks, and it is covered by clouds
of obscurity that threaten us with the gales of skepticism. What we have said
up to this point pertains to all phenomena. But, of course, for the purposes of
the critique of reason, only cognitive phenomena are of interest to us. Yet
what we will now establish here can be applied to all phenomena, as it holds,
mutatis mutandis, for all of them.
The way in which we have envisioned the critique of knowledge has led us
to a beginning, to the mainland of givenness, of which we may avail ourselves
and, above all, of which we appear to stand in need: to fathom the essence of
knowledge I must naturally possess knowledge in all its questionable forms
as given, but in such a way that this givenness has in itself nothing of the
problematical character that the other forms of knowledge bring with them,
however much they might appear to offer a givenness of their own.
Now that we have secured for ourselves the field of pure knowledge, we
can conduct a study of this knowledge, and establish a science of pure
phenomena, a ph�I)tJU��. Is it not obvious that this sciefiCeiiiUstbe the
basis'fbr UiesOf�tion to the problems that have been agitating us? For surely
I can get clear on the essence of knowledge when I see it for myself, and when
it is itself given to me, just as it is, in "seeing." I must study knowledge
inunanently, through a pure seeing, within the pure phenomenon, within "pure
consciousness": its transcendence is, of course, dubitable; the existence of the
objectivity, to which it refers, is not given to me insofar as it is transcendent.
What is in question, then, is how this objectivity can nonetheless be posited,
and what sense it has, and may have, if such positing should be possible. On
the other hand, the relation to something transcendent, whether I question the
existence of the transcendent object or the ability of the relation to make
contact with it, still contains something that can be apprehended within the
pure phenomenon. The relating-itself-to-something-transcendent, to refer to
it in one way or another, is an inner characteristic of the phenomenon. It
would almost seem that it all depends on having a science of absolute
cogitationes. Since I have to strike out the pregivenness of anything transcen­
dent to which I might refer, where else could I examine not only the sense of
this referring that reaches out beyond itself but also its possible validity, or the

36

THE IDEA O F PHENOMENOLOGY

sense of such validity, except where this sense is absolutely given [47] and
where the sense of validity comes to givenness within the pure phenomenon
of relation, confirmation, and justification?
But here again we are stalked by the doubt that something more has to come
into play, that the givenness of validity also brings with it the givenness of the
object, which, for its part, cannot be the givenness of the cogitatio insofar as
it is a matter of valid transcendence. However that may be, a science of
absolute phenomena, understood as cogitationes, is the first thing that is
required, and it will have to yield at least the main part of the solution.
What we intend to establish, then, is a phenomenology, a phenomenology
of knowledge as the theory of the essence of pure phenomena of knowing.
And the prospects are good. But how is phenomenology to proceed? How is
it possible? I am to make judgments, indeed, judgments that are objectively
valid, I am to gain scientific knowledge of pure phenomena. But doesn 't all

science lead to establishing an objectivity existing in itself, thus to what is
transcendent? What is scientifically established is "in itself': it counts as
existing whether I know it and posit it as existing or not. Is it not the essence
of science to have as its correlate only the objectivity that is known by science,
that is scientifically grounded? And is it not the case that what is scientifically
grounded is universally valid? What is the situation here? We move in the
field of pure phenomena. But why do I say "field "

-

is it not rather an eternal

Heraclitean stream of phenomena? What statements can I make about it?
While I

am

seeing it, I can say: this here! - it exists, indubitably. Perhaps I can

even say that this phenomenon includes that phenomenon as a part, or that it
is connected with that one, or that this phenomenon flows into the other one,
etc.
But obviously there is nothing by way of "objective " validity about these
statements. They have no "objective sense "; they have only a "subjective "

truth. At this point we will not conduct an investigation in order to find out
whether these statements, insofar as they claim to be "subjectively" true, also
have their objectivity. But it is clear even in a fleeting glance that the higher
dignity of objectivity, which the natural judgments of prescientific experience

[48] enact, so to speak, and which the valid judgments of the exact sciences
bring to an incomparably higher level of perfection, is entirely lacking here.
Thus w e will not attribute any particular value to such judgments as 'This is
here," and the like, which we make on the basis of pure seeing.
Such judgments remind us of the famous Kantian distinction between

judgments ofperception and judgments of experience. The affinity is obvious.
But, lacking the concept of phenomenology and the phenomenological
reduction, and unable to loose himself entirely from the grip of psychologism
and anthropologism, Kant did not arrive at the ultimate intent of the distinction

37

LECTURE III

that must be made here. For us it is not a matter of merely subjectively valid
judgments, the validity of which is limited to the empirical subject, and
objectively valid j udgments in the sense of being valid for every subject in
general. For we have excluded the empirical subject; and transcendental
apperception, consciousness as such, will soon acquire for us a wholly
different sense, one that is not mysterious at all.
We now return to the main theme under consideration. Phenomenological
judgments, as singular j udgments, are not terribly instructive. But how do we
acquire judgments, especially scientifically valid judgments? The word

" scientific, " however, immediately places us in a preilicament. Doesn't
transcendence, we might ask, come along with o�ectivity, and with transcen­
dence the doubt about what it means and whether and how it i s possible?
Through the epistemological reduction we exclude all transcendent presuppo­
sitions, because the possible validity and sense o f transcendence i s in question.
But then are the scientific conclusions, the transcendent conclusions of
epistemology themselves still valid? Is it not obvious that before the possibil­
ity of transcendence is demonstrated no transcendent conclusion of epistemol­
ogy is secure? But if the epistemological epoche requires - as it appears to do
- that we ascribe no validity to transcendence before we have demonstrated
its possibility, and i f the demonstration of the possibility of transcendence
itself, in the foml of an objective demonstration, requires transcendent
assumptions, then it appears [49J that we are faced with a circle that makes
both phenomenology and epistemology impossible - and our labor of love
will, up to th i s point, have been in vain.
But we will not immediately despair of the possibility of phenomenology
and the critique of knowledge that is quite obviously bound up with it. What
we need here is a further step that will roll out this spurious circle for us. But
we have already taken this step in principle by distingu ishing the two senses
of transcendence and immanence. Descartes asked, as you will recall, after he
had established the evidence of the cogitatio (or rather, in a phrase we have
not adopted, the "cogito ergo sum"): What is it that assures me ofthis basic

givenness ? The answer: clear and distinct perception [clara et distincta
perceptio] . We can latch onto this point. l need not mention the fact that we
have already grasped the matter in a purer and deeper way than Descartes did,
and that we have thus grasped and understood evidence, clear and distinct
perception, in a purer sense. With Descartes we can now take the additional
step (mutatis mutandis): whatever is given through clear and distinct percep­
tion, as it is in any singular cogitatio, we

are

entitled to accept. But if we recall

the third and fourth meditations - the proof of God' s existence, the recourse
to divine veracity [veracitas dell, etc.
be very skeptical, or rather, critical.

we should expect a bad outcome. So,

38

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

We have acknowledged the givenness of the pure cogitatio as absolute, but

not the givenness of the external thing in outer perception, even if this

givenness claims to present the being of the thing itself. The transcendence of
the thing requires that we put the thing in question. We do not see how

perception makes contact with what is transcendent; but we do understand

how it makes contact with what is immanent, if it is a reflective and purely

immanent perception which has undergone the reduction. But why do we

understand this? Because we directly see and grasp precisely what we intend
in the seeing and the grasping. To have an appearance before one's eye, which

refers to something that is not itself given in the phenomenon, and to doubt
whether it exists or how its existence is to be understood

that makes sense.

But to see and to intend nothing other than what is grasped in the seeing, and
yet still

[50] question and doubt - that makes no sense at all. In essence this

is to say: seeing, grasping what is self-given, insofar as it is an actual seeing

that presents an actual self-givenness and not a givenness that refers to
something not given

that is something ultimate. This i s

evidence [absolute Selbstverstiindlichkeit].

absolute self

What is not self-evident, what is

problematic, perhaps even mysterious, is to be found in acts of referring to

what i s transcendent, that is, in referring to, believing in, or even thoroughly

proving something that is not given. It is of no help to us that there is an

absolute givenness to be found here, i.e., the givenness of the referring, the

believing themselves. We need only reflect to discover it. But what is given

here is not what is meant.

But is absolute self-evidence, self-givenness in the act of seeing, present

only in the singUlar experience and its singular moments and parts; can it be
only a matter of positing a

"this-here "

in the act of seeing? Could not there

also be a positing of other forms of givenness as the absolute givenness of, for
instance, universals, where a universal would come to self-evident givenness

in an act of seeing and any doubt concerning it would be absurd?

How remarkable it would be to restrict absolute givenness to the phenome­

nologically singular givenness of the

cogitatio follows from the fact that the

entire meditation on evidence, which we have, following Descartes, carried

out, and which was surely illuminated throughout by clarity and self-evidence,
would lose its validity. In the case of a singular

cogitatio that

lies before us,

say a feeling that we are experiencing, we could perhaps say: i t i s given. But
we could by no means dare to state the most universal proposition:

the
givenness of any reduced phenomenon is an absolute and indubitable
givenness.
But this is just to help you along the way. In any case, it i s illuminating to

note that the possibility of a critique of knowledge depends on the indication

of forms of absolute givenness other than the reduced

cogitationes.

Upon

39

LECTURE 1II

closer consideration, it turns out that we already go beyond these

cogitationes

when we predicate something of them in j udgment. We do so when we say:
this or that phenomenon of representation lies at the basis of this phenomenon
of j udging; this

[5 1 ] phenomenon of perceiving contains these or those

moments - color contents and the like. Even if we grant, for the sake of the
argument, that we are making these assertions in the most exact conformity to
the givenness of the

cogitatio,

the logical forms, which are reflected in the

linguistic expression, take us beyond the mere cogitationes. There is here a
surplus, which does not consist of a mere agglomeration of more cogitationes.
And even if, with such predicative thinking, new

cogitationes

cogitationes

join those

about which we are making statements, the former do not

constitute the predicative state of affairs, the object of the statement.
For those who can place themselves in the position of pure seeing and c an
stay clear of all natural prejudices, it is easier to conceive of knowledge that
can not only bring particulars, but also universals, universal objects, and
universal states of affairs to absolute givenness. This knowledge is of decisive
significance for the possibility of phenomenology. For it is the peculiar

character of phenomenology to analyze and conduct research into essences
within the framework of a reflection that involves only pure seeing, a
framework of absolute self-givenness. And that is necessarily its character; for
it aims to be a science and a method that clarifies possibilities, possibilities of
knowledge, possibilities of evaluation, and clarifies them on the basis of their
fundamental essence. Such possibilities are generally dubitable, and so
research into them will be a general research into essence. Analysis of essence

In any case, this is one justified concept of the

another concept

arises when we range under the title a priori all those concepts that have, in
a certain sense, their principle meaning as categories, and then, in an extended
sense, all those laws of essence that are grounded in them.

a priori states of affairs that constitute themselves on the basis of these species
in a way that can be immediately seen. If we direct ourselves to the critique

form of reason as well, the chief goal is of course the

sense, that is, to establish the principle of self-given forms and states of
affairs, and, by means of these, to develop, analyze, and evaluate those

concepts and laws of logic, of ethics, of value theory, that have a claim to the
status of principles.

LECfURE IV

[55] If we restrict ourselves to just the phenomenology of knowledge, then we
will be concerned with the essence

of knowledge that can be exhibited in direct

intuition. That is, we will be concerned with the exhibition and analytical
partitioning of the various sorts of phenomena that are embraced by the broad
title "knowledge" within the framework of the phenomenological reduction
and self-givenness. Then the question is: what is essentially contained and
grounded in such phenomena; from what factors are they constructed; what
possibilities of combination do they found when they are taken essentially and
as purely immanent; and what general relations flow from them?

[reell] imma­
immanent in the intentional sense. It belongs to the
essence of cognitive experiences to have an intentio: they refer to something;
And here we will not only be concerned with what is really

they relate themselves in one way or another to an objectivity. This "relating
itself to an objectivity" belongs to them even if the objectivity does not. What
is objective can appear, can achieve a certain givenness within appearance,
even though it neither really exists in the phenomenon of knowing nor as a

cogitatio.

To explain the essence of knowledge, and to bring the essential

connections that belong to it to self-givenness, is to inquire into both of these
sides, to investigate this relation that belongs to the essence of knowledge.
Here lie the riddles, the mysteries, the problems concerning the final sense of
the objectivity of knowledge, including its validity or invalidity when it is a
matter of j udgment, its adequation when it is a matter of evidence, etc.
In any case, such research into essence is obviously research into univer­
sals. The singular phenomenon of knowledge, coming and going in the stream
of consciousness, is not the object of phenomenological detennination.
Phenomenology is directed to the "sources of knowing,"

[56] to the general

origins which can be seen, to absolutely given universals that provide the
general criteria in terms of which

the sense and

also the correctness of all our

highly intricate thought is to be ascertained, and by which all the riddles
concerning .its objectivity are to be solved.
But can

universality, can general essences, and the general states of affairs

that belong to them, actually achieve the same kind of self-givenness that a

cogitatio

does?

Does not the universal

as

such transcend knowledge ?

Knowledge of universals, of course, is given as an absolute phenomenon ; but
we will search in vain for the universal that is supposed to be identical in the
strongest sense across like immanent contents of innumerable possible acts of
knowing.

41

42

THE lDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

Our answer is, of course, the answer we have already given: the universal

has this form of transcendence. Each real

[reelle] part of the phenomenon of

knowing, of this phenomenological partiCUlarity, is itself a particularity. Thus

the universal, which is not a particularity, cannot be really

[reell] contained in
this kind of

the consciousness of universality. But one could take exception to

transcendence only on the basis of a prejudice that stems from an inappropri­

ate view of knowledge that is not drawn from the sources themselves. One

must get especially clear on the fact that the absolute phenomenon, the

reduced

cogitatio, does not count as an absolute givenness because it is a

particular, but rather because it displays itself in pure seeing after the
phenomenological reduction as something that is

absolutely self-given. But in

pure seeing we can discover that universality is no less such an absolute
givenness.

Is this actually so?

'Let us consider cases where the universal is given, that

is, cases where a purely immanent consciousness of universality constitutes

itself on the basis of a seen and self-given particularity. I have a particular

intuition of red , or several particular intuitions of red; I attend to pure

immanence alone; I perform the phenomenological reduction. I separate off

anything that red might signify that might lead one to apperceive it as

transcendent, as, say, the red of a piece of blotting paper [57] on my desk, and

the like. And now I actualize in pure seeing the sense of the thought red, red

in specie, the identical universal that is seen in this or that; now the particular­
ity as such is no longer meant, but rather red in general . If we in fact do this
in a pure act of seeing, would it still make sense to doubt what re9 in general

is, what is meant by "red," what it is according to its essence? We see it ­

there it is; there is what we mean, this species red. Could a div'ftie being, an
infinite intellect, do anything more to grasp the essence of red than to see it as
a universal?

And if two species of red are given to us, two nuances of red, can we not

judge that they are similar to each other - not these particular, individual red

phenomena, but rather the species, the nuances as such? Isn't the relation of
similarity a universal that is absolutely given?

Thus this givenness is a purely immanent givenness, not immanent in the

false sense, namely, existing in the sphere of individual consciousness. Here
we are not speaking of the acts of abstraction that occur in the psychological

subject, and the psychological conditions under which they are performed.

Rather, we are speaking of the universal essence red, or the sense red, and its
givenness in the act o f seeing a universal.

Thus it is senseless to question and to doubt what the essence of red is, or

what the sense of red is, provided that, while one is seeing red and grasping

it in terms of its specific kind, one means by the word "red" exactly what is

LECTURE IV

43

grasped and seen. Likewise it makes no sense, with respect t o the essence of

knowledge and fundamental stmcture of knowledge, to doubt what its sense

is while one has the relevant exemplary phenomena and the relevant species

given right before one ' s eyes in a reflection that involves only acts o f pure
seeing and ideating within the sphere of the phenomenological reduction. Now

of course knowledge is not as simple a matter as red. One must distinguish the
manifold forms and kinds of knowledge. Moreover, one must investigate the

ways in which these forms and kinds are related to each other. For to under­
stand knowledge is to clarify generally the

knowledge,

[58]

teleological interconnections

of

which amount to certain essential relations of various

essential types of intellectual forms. And this would include the ultimate

clarification of the principles, which, as the i deal conditions of the possibility

of scientific objectivity, serve as norms governing all of the procedures of
empirical science. The entire investigation carried out for the sake of clarify­
ing these principles moves within the sphere of essence, which, in turn,

constitutes itself on the underlying basis of singular phenomena within the

phenomenological reduction.

At every step the analysis is an analysis of essence and an investigation of

universal states of affairs that are constituted within immediate intuition. The

entire investigation is thus an a priori investigation - but not, of course, in the
sense of mathematical deduction. What distinguishes it from the "objectify­

a priori sciences is its method and its goal. PhellomenoJg� carries out

parts, it separates off moments. But it does all this in the act of pure seeing. It
does not engage in theory or mathematical constmction; that is, it offers no

explanations in the sense of deductive theories. Because it seeks to clarify

basic concepts and basic propositions, which, as principles, govern the

possibility of the obj ectifying sciences - and also makes its own basic

concepts and principles into objects of reflective clarification - it ends where
obj ectifying science begins. Thus it is a science in an entirely different sense,

The
procedure of seeing and ideating within the strictest phenomenological
reduction is its exclusive domain; it is the specifically philosophical method
insofar as this method belongs essentially to the sellSe of the critique of
knowledge alld thus to any critique of reason in general (thus to the critique
with entirely different tasks to fulfill and entirely different methods.

of evaluative and practical reason as well). Whatever genuinely belongs to

philosophy in addition to the critique of reason must be referenced to this

critique. This would include the metaphysics of nature and the metaphysics of

[59] the entire life of culture and hi story [Geistesleben], thus metaphysics in

the widest sense.

44

THE I D E A O F PHENOMENOLOGY

In such cases of seeing, one speaks of evidence, and in fact those who are
acquainted with the precise concept of evidence, and have a firm grip on its
essence, have just these kinds of occurrences in mind. The fundamental point
is that one does not overlook the fact that evidence is this consciousness, a
seeing consciousness that directly and adequately apprehends itself, that
evidence signifies nothing other than adequate self-givenness. Epistemologists
of the empiricist persuasion, who speak so much of the value of investigating
origins, and yet remain just as far removed from the true origins as the most
extreme rationalist, would have us believe that the entire distinction between
evident and non-evident judgments consists in a certain feeling by which the
former make themselves known. But how can feeling contribute to the
intelligibility of anything here? What can it accomplish? Is it, perchance, to
call out to us: "Stop ! Here is the truth !"? And why should we believe this
feeling? Must this belief also be supplied with an index of feeling? And why
does the judgment with the sense "2 times 2 is 5" never have this index of
feeling, and why can't it have it? How does one actually come to this theory
of feeling-indices? Well, one says to oneself: "Logically speaking, the same
judgment, say the judgment

"2 times 2 equals 4," can at one time be evident

to me and at another not be evident to me, the same concept of 4 can at one
time be given to me intuitively with evidence, and at another time be given by
way of a mere symbolic representation. Thus in both cases it i s the same
phenomenon with respect to content, but in the one case a distinguishing
feeling lends it a preferred value, a character of value." But do I in fact have
in each case the same phenomenon, the one accompanied by a feeling, the
other one not? If one attends to the phenomenon, one will immediately notice
that the same phenomenon is not presented in both cases, but rather two

If I

essentially different phenomena that merely have something in common.
see that 2 times

then I am referring to an equality. But to refer to an equality is not to have the
phenomenon of equality. Thus in the two cases the content is different in the
one case I see, and in the act of seeing the state of affairs is itself given; but in
the other case I have only the symbolic reference. In the one case I have
intuition, in the other, an empty intention. [60]
Does the difference then consist i n this, that in both cases there is a
common feature, the same "sense," at one time with the index of feeling and
the other time not? But one should look at the phenomenon itself, and not
speak of it and construe it from on high. Let us take a simpler example: if I at
one time have a vivid intuition of red, and at another time think of red in an
empty symbolic intention, then is it the case that both times the same red­
phenomenon is really [reell] present, the one time with feeling and the other
time without feeling?

LECTURE

45

IV

One need only consider the phenomena to realize that they are entirely
different, united only by what can be identified in both cases, what we call the
"sense." But if the difference exists in the phenomena themselves, do we still
need something like a feeling to distinguish them? And does not the distinc­
tion consist in this, that in the one case the self-givenness of red lies before

us,

the self-givenness of numbers and numerical equality, or, subjectively
expressed, that this matter itself is adequately grasped in an act of seeing, and
in the other case the matter is merely referred to? For this reason we cannot
accept the notion of evidence as feeling. It itself could only be justified if it
were to prove itself in an act of pure seeing and' if this act of pure seeing meant
precisely what we expect of it - which contradicts the notion of evidence

as

feeling.
Applying the concept of evidence, we can also say: we have evidence of the
being of the cogitatio, and because we have evidence, the cogitatio implies no
riddle, and therefore implies no riddle of transcendence; it counts for us as
something unquestionable, something we can make use of. To no lesser degree
we have evidence of universals.

Universal objectivities and states of affairs

come to self-givenness for us, and they are in the same sense unquestionably
given, in the strongest sense adequately self-given.
Accordingly, the phenomenological reduction does not signify the limita­
tion of the investigation to the sphere of real

[reellen] immanence, to the
[reellJ contained in the absolute "this" of the cogitatio,
and it does not at all signify the limitation to the sphere of the cogitatio, but
rather the limitation to the sphere of pure self-givenness, to the sphere of what
is not merely talked about and [61] referred to; but also not to the sphere of
sphere of what is really

what is perceived, but rather to what is given in exactly the same sense in
which it is meant - and self-given in the strictest sense - in such a way that
nothing that is meant fails to be given. In a word, it is a limitation to the sphere
of pure evidence, "evidence" here understood in a strict sense that excludes
"mediate evidence" and, above all, evidence in the loose sense.
Absolute givenness is an ultimate. Of course, one can easily say and
maintain that something is absolutely given when in truth it is not. Again,
absolute givenness can be talked about in a vague way, or it can be given i n
absolute givenness. Just a s I can see the phenomenon red and merely, without
seeing it, talk about it, so I can talk about the seeing of the red and see the
seeing of the red, and thus apprehend the seeing of the red itself in an act of
seeing. On the other hand, to deny self-givenness in general is to deny every
ultimate norm, every basic criterion that lends sense to knowledge. But then
one would have to take everything as illusion, and, in an absurd way, also take
illusion as such to be an illusion, and thus get involved in the absurdity of
skepticism. But clearly only those who countenance grounds, who assign

46

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

some meaning to seeing and evidence, can argue in this way against the
skeptic. The one who does not see, or does not want to see, the one who
speaks and argues, but always remains in a position of accepting all contradic­
tions and at the same time denying all contradictions - with such a person we
cannot even get started. We cannot answer by saying, "obviously" it is so,
because such a person would deny that anything can be "obvious"; it is as if
a blind person would want to deny that there is such a thing as seeing - or
better, as if a person who can see would want to deny that he himself sees and
that there is anything like seeing. How could we convince such a person,
under the assumption that he has no other mode of sense perception?
If we hold onto the self-givenness which, as we have already established,
is not the self-givenness of real
particulars of the

[reeller] particulars, say, the absolute
cogitatio, then the question arises as to how far this self­

givenness extends and to what extent, or in what sense, it is bound to the
sphere of the

cogitationes [62] and the generalizing universals drawn from the

sphere. If one has thrown off the first and immediate prej udice that sees the
absolutely given only in the singular

cogitatio and the sphere of real [reellen]

immanence, then one must also do away with the additional and no less
immediate prejudice, according to which new self-given objectivities grow

only in the general intuitions derived from this sphere.
"Cogitationes are absolutely given to us in reflective perception in that we
consciously experience them" - so one would like to begin; and then we
could spy out the universals that are singled out within them and within their
real

[reellen] moments, apprehend the universals in intuitive abstraction, and

constitute the essential connections that are based purely in these universals
as self-given states of affairs in a thinking that sees and relates. And that
would be all.
No tendency, however, is more dangerous to the intuitive knowledge of
origins, of those things absolutely given, than to think too much, and to draw
out of such thoughtful reflection things that are ostensibly obvious - things
that for the most part are not explicitly fonnulated and for that reason not
subject to any critique based on an act of seeing; things that rather remain
unexpressed, determining and inappropriately limiting the direction of
research.

Intuitive knowledge is thatfonn of reason that sets itself the task of
bringing the discursive understanding to reason. The understanding must not

be allowed to interrupt and smuggle its unredeemed banknotes among those
that have already been cashed; yet its method of exchange and conversion,
which is based upon mere treasury bonds, is not questioned here at alL
Hence: as little understanding as possible, as much pure intuition as
possible

(intuitio sine comprehensione). Indeed, we are here reminded of the

speech of the mystics when they describe the intellectual act of seeing that

LECTURE

IV

47

contains no discursive knowledge. The whole trick here is to let the seeing eyc
have its say and to exclude all transcendent reference that is interwoven with
seeing, those things that are ostensibly given or thought along with what is
seen, and, finally, those things that i n subsequent reflection get imputed to
what is given. The constant question is: is the intended object

[63] also given

in the genuine sense, seen and apprehended in the strictest sense, or does the
intention go beyond it?
Supposing this to be the case, we soon realize that it would be
believe that intuitive research moves in the sphere of so-called

afictiol1 to
inner percep­

tion and a purely immanent abstraction built upon it that ideates its phenom­
ena and phenomenal moments. There

are

diverse modes of objectivity and,

with them, diverse modes of so-called givenness, and perhaps the givenness
of particular existing things in the sense of "inner perception" and the
givenness of things in positive, objectifying science is only one kind of
givenness, while the others, although characterized as presenting non-existent
entities, are still types of givelmess if only because they can be set over against
the other sorts and distinguished from them with respect to their forms of
evidence.

LECTURE V

(67) If we have established the evidence of the cogitatio, and, in a further step,
acknowledged the evident givenness of universals, then this step will
immediately lead us to take additional steps.
By perceiving color and exercising the reduction upon this perception, I
acquire the pure phenomenon of color. And if I then perform a pure abstrac­
tion, I acquire the essence of phenomenological color in general. But am I not
also in full possession of this essence when I clearly imagine this color?

(Memory,

however, is not a simple matter. From the very start it offers

different forms of objectivity and givenness, all interwoven with each other.
Thus one could refer to the so-called primary

memory, to the retention that is

necessarily bound up with every perception. The experience that we are now
undergoing becomes objective for us in immediate reflection, and in this
experience the same object continues to present itself: the same tone, which
has just existed as an actual now, remains the same tone from that point on,
only now moving back into the past and thus constituting the same objective

point in tim�J And if the tone does not cease but rather endures, and during its

continuation presents itself as the same or as changing i n content, can we not

grasp this fact - the fact that it endures or changes

with evidence (within

certain bounds)? And does not this mean, in tum, that seeing reaches beyond
the pure now-point, that it is thus capable of intentionally holding on, in a new
now, to what no longer exists now, and is therefore capable of becoming

certain about a stretch of the past as a matter of evident givenness? Here again
we must distinguish between, on the one hand, what is objective, what is and
was, what endures and changes, and, on the other hand, the phenomenon of
the present and the past, the phenomenon of duration and change, which is at
times a now, and in whose profiles, which it contains, and in the constant

{68]

alteration it undergoes, brings temporal being to appearance, to presentation.
The object is not a real

{reelles] part of the phenomenon - in its temporality

it has something that cannot be found in or resolved into the phenomenon even
though it constitutes itself within the phenomenon. It presents itself in the
phenomenon, and in the phenomenon it is given with evidence as "existing."
A further point can be made in connection with the givenness of essence:
it does not constitute itself just on the basis of perception, and the retention
woven within perception, in such a way that it, so to speak, plucks out a
universal from the phenomenon itself; rather, it constitutes itself by

izing the appearing object, positing

universal­

a universal with regard to it: for instance,

temporal content in general, duration in general, change in general. Further-

more, imagination and recollection can serve as its basis by providing
possibilities that can be purely apprehended. In the same sense it can pick out
universalities in these acts, universals that, for their part, are not really

[reell]

contained in these acts.
Obviously a completely evident apprehension does

refer back to a singular

intuition, on the basis of which it must constitute itself, but not necessarily to
a

singular perception that presents the exemplary particular as something

really [reell] given in the present. The essence of the phenomenological tone
quality, tone intensity, the tone of colors, brightness, and the like, is itself
given even if the ideating abstraction occurs on the basis of a perceptioll or on
the basis of a

representation in imagination. The actual positing of existence,
irrelevant. The same holds

or the modification of that positing, is in both cases

for the apprehension of essence that relates to the species of mental data in the
genuine sense, such as j udgment, affirmation, denial, perception, inference,
and the like. And, of course, it also holds for general states of affairs that
belong to such universals. The insight that of two different tones, one is lower
and the other is higher, and that this relation is not reversible, constitutes itself
in an act of seeing. The instances must stand before our eyes, but not in the
same way that states of affairs do in perception. In a consideration of essence,
perception and imaginative representation are entirely equivalent - the same
essence can been seen in both,

[69] can be abstracted in both, the positing of

existence in each case being irrelevant. That the perceived tone together with
its intensity, its quality, etc.,

exists in a certain sense, while the tone in
exist; that the one is really

imagination, that is, the imagined tone, does not

[reell] present with evidence, while the other is not; that, in the case of
recollection, it is posited as having been rather than as existing now, and must
now be re-presented

all this belongs to a different consideration. For the

consideration of essence, such matters do not come up, unless it directs itself
to precisely these distinctions, which also have their givenness that can be
presented and about which general insights can be established.
It is, moreover, clear that even if the underlying instances are given in
perceptions, it is precisely that which lends distinction to the givenness of
perception

namely, existence - that has no bearing on the matter. hnagina­

tion, however, not only functions in the same way as perception in the
consideration of essence, it also seems that

singular things are given in it, even

given with evidence.
Let us consider

mere imagination, without the positing that belongs to

memory.
An imagined color is not a givenness in the sense of color sensation. We
now distinguish between the imagined color and an experience of imagining
this color. The hovering of the color before me

to put it roughly

is a

LECTURE V
"now," a presently existing

51

cogitatio, but the color itself i s not a presently

existing color, it is not being sensed. On the other hand, it is in a certain way
given: it stands before my gaze. Like the colors of sensation, it ean also be
reduced through the exclusion of all transcendent significance. Thus it
signifies to me not the color of the paper, the color of the house, and the like.
All empirical positings of existence can be suspended. Then l can take it j ust
as I "see" it, as I "experience" it. Nevertheless, i t i s not a real

[reeller) part of

the experience of imagination. It i s not a presented color, but a re-presented
color. In both cases it stands, as it were, before the gaze, but not

as

a real

[reelle) presence. Nevertheless, it is seen, and as seen it is in a certain sense
given. Here I do not posit it as a physical or a mental existence; neither do I
posit it in the sense of a genuine cogitatio; for a cogitatio is a real "now," a
givel1ness, which is characterized with evidence as givenness in the "now."

[70] That an imagined color is not given in one or another sense does not
mean that it is given in no sense. It appears and appears itself; it presents
itself; in an act of seeing it in its re-presentation I can make j udgments about
it and about the moments that constitute it and their interconnections. Of
course these moments too are given in the same sense and not "actually"
existing anywhere ill the experience of imagination; they are not really

[reell]

present, only "represented." The pure judgment of imagination, that merely
gives expression to the

content, the singUlar essence of what appears, can

assert: this is of this kind, contains these moments, changes thus and so,
without in the least passing judgment on existence as actual being in actual
time, on the actual being of the now, of the past, or of the future. Thus w e
could say that a j udgment i s made about t h e

individual essence, but n o t

existence. For precisely this reason, the general j udgment pertaining to
essence

which we usually designate simply as the j udgment of essence

is

independent of the distinction between perception and imagination. Perception
posits

existence; but it also has an essence, which, as a content posited as

existing can be the same in re-presentation.
But the contrast between

existence and essence means nothing other than

that here two modes of being manifest themselves in two modes of givenness
which have to be distingui shed. In the mere imagining of a color, the existence
that concerns the color as an actuality in time has no bearing on the matter; no
j udgments are made about it, and nothing of it is given in the content of the
imagining. But the color appears, it stands there, it is a "this," it can become
the subject of a j udgment, even an evident judgment. Thus a mode of
givenness manifests itself in the intuitions of imagination and such evident
j udgments as

are

grounded in them. But of course we are restricting ourselves

to the sphere of singular individuals, so we can't get much underway with
these kinds of j udgments. Only when we construct general j udgments of

52

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

essence do we attain the secure objectivity required by science. But nothing
like that comes up here. So, we seem to have fallen into a pretty kettle of fish.
We began with the evidence of the cogitatio. At first it appeared as though
we were on firm ground [71] being, pure and simple. One had simply to
grasp it and to see it. That one could make comparisons and distinctions with
regard to such givenness, that one could bring out specific universalities and
thus attain judgments of essence all that one could easily admit. But, upon
closer examination, it now turns out that the pure being of the cogitatio does
not present itself as so simple a matter; it turns out that diverse forms of
objectivity "constitute" themselves i n the Cartesian sphere, and that "constitu­
tion" me41ns that things given immanently are not, as it first appeared, i n
consciousness a s things are in a box, but rather that they present themselves
in something like "appearances," in appearances that are not themselves the
objects, and do not really contain the objects, appearan(.'es that in a certain
sense create objects for the ego in their changing and highly pe{;uliar structure
- "create" insofar as it is appearances of precisely such a sort and structure
that belong to what we have been calling "givenness."
rThe original object of time constitutes itself in perception and the retention
that belongs to it. Only in such a consciousness can time be given. Thus the
universal constitutes itself in a consciollsness of universality that is built upon
perception or imagination, and in imagination as wen as i n perception it
constitutes itself by disregarding the positing of the existence of the intuitive
content in the sense of singular essencclThus, to remind ourselves once again,
we have the categorial acts, which are presupposed by evident assertions. The
categorial forms that come to the fore here, that get expressed in such words
as "is" and "is not," "the same" and "the other," "one" and "several," "and"
and "or," in the form of predication and attribution, etc., indicate forms of
thinking by means of which thought-fornlS that, if appropriately built up, come
to consciousness on the basis of given objects synthetically connected i n
elementary acts so as to present states o f affairs o f this o r that ontological
form. It is also here that the "self-constitution" of spedfic objectivities takes
place in acts of thought formed in certain ways. And consciousness, in which
givenness and likewise the pure act of seeing things occur, is once again not
something like a mere box in which [72] things given simply are; rather,
seeing consciousness apart from mere attentiveness - is just acts of thought
formed in certain ways, and things, which are not acts of thought, are
nonetheless constituted in them, come to given ness in them - and, as a matter
of principle, show themselves to be what they are only when they are thus
constituted.
But is this not a plain miracle? Where does this constituting of objectivity
start, and where does it end? Are there any real limits to it? Doesn't a

givenness occur in every representation, i n every judgment? Isn ' t every
objectivity, insofar as it is seen, imagined, or thought in such and such a way,
a givenness, even an evident givenness? fu the perception of an external thing,
say the house standing before us, it is precisel y the thing that is perceived.
This house is a transcendence, and forfeits its existence after the phenomenol­
ogical reduction. What is then actually given is the appearing of the house, this

cogitatio,

emerging in the stream of consciousness and eventually flowing

away. In this house-phenomenon we find a red-phenomenon, an extension­
phenomenon, etc. And these are given with evidence. But is it not also evident
that a house appears in the house-phenomenon, thus giving us a reason to call
it a house-perception? Furthennore, is it not just a house in general, but this
house, determined in such and such a w ay and appearing with just these
determinations? Can I not with evidence make a judgment by saying:
according to the appearance, or according to the sense of this percept ion, the
house is so and so, a brick building, with a slate roof, etc.?
And when I call forth a fiction i n my imagination, so that, say, before me
8t. George the knight is killing a dragon, is it not evident that the imagined
phenomenon represents precisely St. George, even the one right before me;
and that it represents this St. George as something transcendent? Can I not
here make a judgment, not about the real

[reellen] content of the appearance

within imagination, but rather about the appearing object? To be sure, only a
side of the object - and soon another side - falls within the framework of the
actual re-presentation. But however that may be, it is still evident that this
object

the knight 81. George, etc.

lies within the sense of the appearance,

and manifests itself within the appearances as a "givenness."

[73]

And finally, let us consider so-caned symbolic thinking. Without any
intuition, I think

"2 times 2

is 4." Can I doubt that I am thinking about this

numerical proposition and that this thought does not concern, say, today' s
weather? Here too I have evidence, and therefore something like givenness.
And if we are prepared to go this far, then nothing prevents us from also
recognizing the fact that in a certain way what is completely absurd can also
be "given." A round rectangle does not appear to me in the imagination, as the
dragon killer did, nor does it appear in perception

as

an arbitrary external

thing. But an intentional object is nevertheless obviously there. I can describe
the phenomenon, "thinking of a round rectangle," in terms of its real contents,
but the round rectangle is not in there. Yet it is evident that it is thought in this
thinking and that roundness and rectangularity are attributed to it when it is
thought in this way or that the object of this thought i s round and rectangular
at the same time.
Now we should not maintain that what we have cited in this last series of
considerations is given in the genuine sense of actual givenness. Otherwise it

54

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

would tum out that anything perceived, imagined, pretended, or symbolically
represented, every fiction and absurdity would be "given with evidence." We
only want to point out the great difficulties that lie here. And yet, as a matter
of principle, these difficulties cannot, prior to their clarification, prevent us
from saying that evidence and give/mess are co-extensive. The chief question
will be, of course, exactly what is actually given and what is not given when
evidence occurs in its pure state? What is produced within the phenomenon
by inauthentic thinking and then imputed to it without any grounds in
givenness?
Above all, answering this question is not a matter of establishing arbitrarily
choosen appearances as given, but rather gaining insight into the essence of
givenness and the self-constitution of the different modes of obj ectivity.
Surely every thought-phenomenon has its objective reference, and such a
phenomenon - and this is a primary insight into its essence has its real
[reellen] content, moments that make it up in a real [reellen] sense as a belief;
and, on the other hand, it also has its intentional object, an object that it
intends as constituted in a certain way according to its essential kind. [74]
If this situation is actually to be made evident, then this evidence itself must
teach us all we need to know. In evidence, it must become clear what
"intentional inexistence" really means and how it is related to the real [reellen]
content of the thought-phenomenon itself. We must see in which connection
it appears as actual and genuine evidence, and what is actually genuinely
given in this connection. This will be a matter of exhibiting the different modes
of genuine givenness, and, ill this regard, the constitution of the different
modes of objectivity and their relation to each other: the givenness of the
cogitatio, the givenness of the cogitatio re-lived in a fresh memory, the
givenness of the unity of appearances persisting in the phenomenal stream, the
givenness pf the change in such a unity, the givenness of the thing i n "outer"
perception, the givenness of the different forms of imagination and recollec­
tion, as well as the givenness of manifold perceptions and other kinds of
representations that are synthetically unified in corresponding connections.
And of course there is also logical give/mess, the givenness of universality, of
predicates, of states of affairs, etc., and the givenness of absurdity, contradic­
tion, of a noll-existent object, etc. In general, givenness whether it manifests
itself in connection with something merely represented or truly existing, real
or ideal, possible or impossible
is a givenness in the phenomenon of
knowing, in the phenomenon of thought in the widest sense of the word, and
in each case this initially miraculous con'elation is to be investigated in tenns
of its essence.
The essence of givenness can only be studied with regard to all its basic
fOnTIS in knowing. For only in knowing is it given, is it to be seen with

LECTURE V

evidence. This evident act ofseeing is itself knowing in the

most precise sense;

and objectivity is not something that i s in knowing like something is in a sack,
as if knowing were a completely empty form - one and the same empty sack
into which one thing is put, [75] and then another. Rather, in givenness we
see

that the object constitutes itself in knowing,

that one can distinguish as

many basic forms of acts of knowing, groups, and interconnections of acts of
knowing, as there are basic forms of objectivity. Moreover, the acts of
knowing, more broadly apprehended as acts of thought in general, are not
free-floating partiCUlarities, coming and going in the stream of consciousness.
Rather, essentially related to each other, they display teleological

illterconllectioll and

fonus of

corresponding connections of fulfillment, corroboration,

confirmation, and their counterparts. And everything depends upon the
interconnections that present intelligible unity. They themselves constitute
objectivity; they connect in a logical way those acts of inauthentic givenness
with acts of authentic givenness, acts of mere representation, or rather mere
believing and acts of insight, and the manifolds of acts that

are

related to the

same object, be they acts of intuitive or non-intuitive thinking.
And it is only in these conncctions that the objectivity of the objective

be studied, and studied in the sphere of pure evidence, in

order to clarify the great problems of the essence of knowledge and of the

correlation of knowledge and known objectivity. The original
the relation between subjective psychological experience and the
reality in itself apprehended in this experience, at first the real reality, and

sense of the

problem was

later the mathematical and other forms of ideal reality. But first we need that
insight that the

object,

radical problem is rather the relation between knowledge and
reduced sense, according to which we are dealing not with

but in the

human knowledge but rather with knowledge in general, without any relation
to existential co-positings,

be they of the empirical ego or of a real world. We

need the insight that the truly significant [76] problem is the problem of the

ultimate sense-bestowal of knowledge,

and thus of objectivity in general,

which is what it is only in its correlation to possible knowledge. Furthermore,
we need the insight that this problem can be solved only in the sphere of pure
evidence, in the sphere of givellness, which provides the ultimate norms
because it is absolute; and that accordingly, we must investigate one by one
all the basic forms of knowledge and all the basics forms of objectivity that
come to givenness in it either fully or partially, in order to determine the sense
of all those correlations that can be explicated.

I

In knowledge, nature is given, but so is humanity in its associations and
cultural works. All that is known. But to the knowledge of culture belongs
valuing and willing as parts of the act that constitutes the sense of objectivity.
Knowledge refers to the object with a varying sense in varying experiences,
in the varying affects and actions of the ego.
In addition to the formal logical doctrine of sense, and the doctrine of true
propositions as valid senses, we have in the natural attitude still other positive
scientific investigations: we distinguish basic species (regions) from objects
and consider, for instance, for the region of mere physical nature in its
essential generality, what belongs ineliminably to it and to every object of
nature in itself and in its relation to nature. We develop an ontology of nature.
There we explicate the sense and that means the valid sense of a natural
object as the object of the knowledge of nature, as an object meant in such
knowledge: that without which a possible object of nature, that is, an object
of possible external experience of nature, cannot be thought if it is to be
capable of truly existing. Thus, we consider the sense of external experience
[Eifahrung] (the object-meant), indeed the sense in its truth, its true or valid
existence according to its essential constituents.
Likewise we consider the true sense oj an artwork in general and the
specific sense of a particular artwork. In the former case, we study the
"essence" of a work of art in its pure generality; in the latter case, the actual
content of the actually given artwork, what here comes to the same thing as
the knowing of the determinant object (as truly existing, according to its true
determinations), say a symphony of Beethoven's. Likewise we study generally
the essence of the state in general, or empirically the essence of the German
state in some epoch, according to its general features or in entirely individu al
determinations, thus this individual objective being "the German state." The
parallel here is something like the determination of the natural features of the
individual object Earth. Thus, in addition to empirical research, we have
empirical laws and individuals, ontological research, research of truly valid
senses not only in formal generality, but also in the particularity of material
regions.

57

THE lDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

58

To be sure, pure research into essences is never, or only in exceptional
cases, cultivated in complete purity. Nonetheless, some groups of scientific
investigations point in this direction; yet they remain on a natural basis. To
these belong psychological research, directed upon cognitive expetiences and
ego activities in general or in relation to the relevant object regions - upon the
subjective manners in which such objects give themselves to us, in which the
subject relates itself to them, how it comes to fonn such "representations" of
them, which kinds of acts and experiences (e.g., evaluative and volitional)
play a role in the formation of such representations.
Further: a particularly sensitive problem is that of the possibility of arriving
at the being of the object itself, first just with respect to nature. It is there on
its own, one says to oneself, whether we are there knowing it or not; it
proceeds along its course by itself. We recognize other humans beings through
expression in their bodiliness, thus on the basis of physical objects, just as we
recognize, on the one hand, artworks and other cultural obj ects, and, on the
other hand, social groups. It seems, at first, that if we were only in a po sition
to understand the possibility of the knowledge of nature, we would also be in
a position to understand the possibility of all other forms of knowledge by
means of psychology. And psychology does not appear to offer any special
problems, since the one who is knowing directly experiences his own mental
life and that of others by way of analogy to it in "empathy." Let us limit
ourselves, as it was done in epistemology until recently, to the theory of the
knowledge of nature.

An attempt at alteration and supplementation: assume that I would be just as
I am, that I would have been just as I was, and that I would be in the future
just as I will be; assume that in all this there is nothing lacking by way of my
perceptions pertaining to the five senses or any other perceptions in general;
nothing lacking by way of my apperceptive processes, none of my conceptual
thoughts, none of my imaginations and thought experiences, or any of my
experiences in general

assume all of them in their concrete fullness, in their

determinate arrangements and connections; what would prevent there from
being simply nothing at all in addition to them? Could not an all-powerful God
or a deceitful spirit have so created my mind and supplied it with mental
content that nothing exists of all the objectivities that are meant within i t
insofar a s they are extra-mental? Perhaps things do exist outside o f me, but not
one of those that I take to be real. And perhaps there is nothing outside me at
all.
But I do assume that there are actual things, things outside of me - but on
what basis? On the basis of external perception? With one look I apprehend
my thing-filled surroundings, right up to the most distant world of fixed stars.
But perhaps that is all a dream, a deception of the senses. This and that visual
content, this and that apperception, this and that judgment, that is the given,
the only given in the genuine sense. Does perception carry with it some

evidence for this achievement of transcendence? But a piece of evidence, what
is this other than a certain mental characteristic? Perception plus the charac­
teristic of evidence, that is the given, and why something should now
correspond to this complex is an enigma. Perhaps I then say: we

infer

transcendence, through inferences we go beyond the immediate given, it is
generally an achievement of inferences that what is not given is grounded in
what is given. But even if we set aside the question of how such grounding
can be achieved, we will respond: analytical inferences would be of no help,
for the transcendent is not implied in the immanent. But synthetic inferences,
how can they be anything other than inferences of experience? What is
experienced provides experiential grounds, that is: rational grounds of
probability for what is not experienced, but then only for what is experience­
able. But transcendence is in principle not experienceable.

says: knowledge is something other than the known object.

Knowledge is given, but the known object is not given - especially and as a
matter of principle in the sphere of those objects that are called transcendent.
And yet knowledge is supposed to relate itself to the object and know it - how
is that possible?
How an image corresponds to a thing - that we believe we understand. But
that it is an image we would only know from cases given to us in which we
have the thing just as we have the image so as to compare the one with the
other.
But how can knowledge go beyond itself to reach the object and yet be sure
of this relation with complete indubitability? How can we understand that
knowledge, without losing its immanence, can not only be correct but can also
demonstrate this correctness? This being the question, this possibility of
demonstration presupposes that I can see that the knowledge of the relevant
kind accomplishes what is here required. And only when that is the case can
we understand the possibility of knowledge. But is transcendence an essential
characteristic of certain objects of knowledge - how does it go here?
Thus the consideration presupposes precisely this: that transcendence is an
essential characteristic of certain objects, and that known objects of that type
can never be immanently given and can never exist immanently. The whole
conception also presupposes that immanence itself is not in question. How
immanence can be known is intelligible, how transcendence is known,
unintelligible.

[3] THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN THE LECTURES

Natural thought in life and in science is untroubled by the difficulties
concerning the possibility of knowledge, while philosophical thought is
determined by the position taken with respect to the problems of the possibil­
ity of knowledge.
The perplexities in which the reflection on the possibility of a knowledge
that makes contact with the things themselves becomes involved: how can
knowledge be sure that it corresponds to things as they exist in themselves,
that it "makes contact" with them? What do the things themselves care about
our ways of thinking and the logical rules that govern them? They are laws of
our thinking, psychological laws. - Biologi sm, psychological laws as laws o f
adaptation.
Absurdity: when one engages in natural reflection upon knowledge and
subordinates it and its achievements to the natural system of thought found in
the sciences, one at first gets involved in theories that, although initially
attractive, invariably end up in contradiction or absurdity. - Tendency toward
blatant skepticism.
Even an attempt like this at staking out a scientific position on such
problems can be called epistemology. But inevitably there emerges here the
idea of epistemology as a science that would solve the difficulties just
mentioned as it provided us with a definitive, clear, and therefore internally
consistent insight into the essence of knowledge and the possibility o f
achieving it.

A critique o f knowledge i n this sense is the condition of the

possibility of a metaphysics.
The method of the critique of knowledge is the phenomenological method,
phenomenology as the general doctrine of essence, within which the science
.
of the essence of knowledge finds its place.
What sort of method is this? How can a science of knowledge establish
itself if knowledge as such, its sense and its achievement, is put in question ?
What method can then lead u s t o the goal? [4]

A. THE FIRST STEP IN THE PHENOMENOWGICAL CONSIDERATION
1 . At the very outset one might wonder whether such a science is at all
possible. If this science calls all knowledge into question, how can it then
begin, since every piece of knowledge that might be chosen as a point of
departure is thereby also called into question?

61

62

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

The difficulty here, however, is only apparent. For knowledge is not denied,
nor is it regarded as doubtful in

every sense, when

it is "called into question."

The question is directed to certain achievements that have been attributed to
knowledge, but it remains an open question whether the difficulties pertain to
all possible types of knowledge. At any rate, if epistemology is to addres s the
possibility of knowledge, then it must possess forms of knowledge concerning
the possibility of knowledge that are themselves indubitable, that count as
knowledge in the strictest sense - where there is absolutely no doubt about
their own possibility or the fact that they have made contact with their object.

If we become unclear or uncertain as to how it is possible for knowledge to
reach its object, and if we are then inclined to doubt whethcr such a thing is
possible, then we must first consider indubitable cases of knowledge or
possible knowledge - ones where knowledge actually reaches, or would reach,
its object. At the outset we may not simply assume that some example of
knowledge is indeed knowledge, otherwise we would have no possible or what comes to the same thing - meaningful goal.
Here the
being of the

Cartesian meditation on doubt provides us with a beginning: the
cogitatio, of experience as it occurs and is simply being reflected

upon, cannot
the

be doubted; the intuitive, direct apprehension and possession of

cogitatio is itself a

knowing, the

cogitationes are the first

absolute items

of givenness.

2. What follows quite naturally from this is the first epistemological

reflection:

what constitutes the unquestionability of these cases, and, in

contrast to them, the questionability of other cases of alleged knowledge?
Why is there in certain cases the tendency to skepticism and the skeptical
question: how can contact with a being be made in knowledge?; and why, in
the case of cogitationes, is this doubt and this difficulty absent?
One answers - and this i s the obvious answer
pair or word pair
the

cogitatio

[5]

in terms of the conceptual

immanence and transcendence. The intuitive knowledge of

is immanent, the knowledge that belongs to the objective

sciences - the natural and the human sciences, and, upon closer consideration,
the mathematical sciences as well

is transcendent. With the oJ:ti ective

sciences comes transcendence, which is always questionable. One can ask:
how can knowledge reach out beyond itself, how can it make contact with a
being that is not to bc found within the confines of consciousness? With the
intuitive knowledge of the

cogitatio,

this difficulty falls away.

3. At first one is inclined to interpret, as if it were entirely obvious,

innnanence as real [reelle] immanence, indeed, as real

[reale]

immanence in

the psychological sense: the object of knowledge also exists in the experience
of knowing, or in the consciousness of the ego, to which the experience
belongs, as a real actuality. One takes it to be a simple matter of course that

63

THE TRAIN 01' THOUGHT I N THE LECTURES

the act o f knowing finds and makes contact with its obj ect in the same
consciousness and in the same real

[realen]

now. The immanent is in

me,

the

beginner will say at this point, and the transcendent is outside of me.
Upon closer examination, however, one can distinguish between real
[reelle] immanence and immanence in the sense of the self-givenness that
constitutes itself in evidence. What is really [reell] immanent counts as
indubitable precisely because it presents nothing else, it refers to nothing
"beyond" itself, because here what is meant is also adequately self-given, full
and complete. At fIrst any form of self-givenness other than the self-givenness
of the really

[reell]

immanent is not yet in view.

4. So at first no distinction is made. The first step toward clarity is now this:
the really

[reell] immanent or,

what means the same here, the adequately self­

given is beyond question. I may make use of it. That which is transcendent
(not really [reell] immanent) I may not use. For that reason I must perform the
phenomenological reduction; I must exclude all that is posited as transcen­
dent.
Why? If I am unclear about how know ledge can make contact with what is
transcendent, not the self-given but rather what is referred to "beyond,"

[6]

then surely no forms of transcendent knowledge or science will assist me in
achieving clarity, What I want i s

clarity. I want to understand

the possibility

of this contact, that is, if we consider what we mean here: I want to bring
within my purview the essence of the possibility of this contact, to bring it to
givenness in an act of seeing. A "seeing" cannot be demonstrated. A blind
person who would like to be able to see cannot acquire that ability through
scientific demonstrations; physical and physiological theories of color yield
no intuitive clarity about the sense of color comparable to the clarity possessed
by those who can see. If the critique of knowledge is a science that seeks only
to clarify all species and forms of knowledge
without doubt - then

as this consideration shows

it can make no use of the positive sciences. It cannot

tie

into the results of the positive sciences, nor their conclusions about what
exists, for all of these remain in question for it. All of the sciences are for it
only

science-phenomena. Every tie to science of this sort signifies a mistaken

j.L€1:'upaot'3. This comes

about only through a mistaken, but entirely natural,

shifting of(he problem: between the explanation [Erklarung] of knowledge

as

a natural fact as offered by the natural science of psychology, and the
clarification

[Aujkllirung]

of knowledge in terms of the essential possibilities

of its achievement. Thus, if this shifting is to be avoided, and we are to remain
focused upon the sense of the question concerning this possibility, the

phenomellological reduction

is required.

This means: everything transcendent (everything not given immanently to
me) is to be assigned the index of zero, that is, its existence, its validity is not

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

64

to be assumed as such, except as at most the phenomenon of validity. I may
have recourse to the sciences only as phenomena, and therefore not as systemq
of valid truths , or as premises, or even as hypotheses that I could use as points
of departure - for instance, the whole of psychology or the whole of the
natural sciences. For the proper sense of the principle lies in the constant
requirement of sticking with the things that are put in question here by the
critique of knowledge and not to confuse the problems brought up here with
entirely different problems. The clarification of the possibilities of knowledge
does not follow the ways of obj ective science. [7] To bring knowledge to
evident self-givenness, and to try to see therein the essence of its achievement,
is not a matter of deducing, i nducing, calculating, and the like; and it is not a
matter of deriving in a reasoned way new things from things already given, or
fro m things that count as already given.

B. THE SECOND STEP IN THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONSIDERATION
At this point we need a new level of consideration in order to achieve a higher
degree of clarity regarding the essence of phenomenological research and its
problems.
1. First the Cartesian

cogitatio itself requires the phenomenological

reduction. The psychological phenomenon in psychological apperception and
obj ectification is not really an absolute givenness. rather, only the pure
phenomenon, the reduced phenomenon. The experiencing ego, the object, the
human being in world-time, the thing among things, etc., are not absolute
givennesses, and therefore experience as this human being's experience is not
an absolute givenness either. We abandon once and for all the basis of

psychology

even descriptive psychology. Thus the question that initially

drove us is also reduced: not how can J, this person, in my experiences, make
contact with a being in itself, something that exists out there, outside of me;
in place of this question, which was ambiguous and, because of its transcen­
dent freight, unstable and complex, we have now a pure basic question: how
can the pure phenomenon of knowledge make contact with something that is
not immanent to it, how can the absolute self-givenness of knowledge make
contact with something that i s not self-given, and how is this contact to be
understood?
At the same time the concept of real {reellenl immanence is reduced. It no
longer signifies real {reale1 i mmanence, immanence in the consciousness of
a person and in a real [realen] mental phenomenon.

2. It would seem that once we have the "seen" phenomena, we also have a
phenomenology, a science of these phenomena.

THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN THE LECTURES

65

But as soon as we begin there, we notice certain limitations. [8] The field
of absolute phenomena

taken in their particularity - does not appear to be

sufficient to satisfy our intentions. What will these particular "seeings" do for
us, even if they bring the cogitationes to self-givenness with complete
certainty? At first it would appear entirely obvious that one can perform
logical operations on the basis of these "seeings," that one can compare,
distinguish, subsume under concepts, predicate. But later it will tum out, as we
shall see, that new objectivities stand behind these operations. If we simply
accept what seems obvious here, and consider it no further, then we will not
see how generally valid claims are to be made, claims of the sort we need.
But there is something that appears to help us along: ideating abstraction.
It yields for us generalities, species, and essences that admit of insight - and

thus it appears that the magic word has been spoken: we seek intuitive clarity
about the essence of knowledge; knowledge belongs to the sphere cogitatio­

nes; so we must simply raise, in an act of seeing, the general objectivities of
this sphere to consciousness of generalities, and a doctrine of the essence of
knowledge becomes possible.
We take this step following Descartes's observation concerning clear and
distinct perception. The "existence" of the cogitatio is guaranteed by its
absolute self-givenness, by its givenness in pure evidence. It follows that
wherever we have pure evidence, the pure and direct seeing and grasping of
an objectivity itself, we have the same rights, the same certainties.
This step provides us with a new objectivity that counts as absolute
givenness, the objectivity of essences; and just as the logical acts that find
expression in statements based upon what is seen remain at the beginning
unnoticed, so it is at the same time with the field of statements regarding

essences with respect to general states of affairs given in pure seeing, at first
undifferentiated from particular cases of general givenness.

3. Do we now have everything, do we have a fully delineated phenomenol­
ogy and a clear self-understanding that puts us in possession of all that we
need for a critique of knowledge? [9] And do we have clarity about the
problems that are to be solved?
No, the step that we took leads us further. To begin with, it makes clear to
us that real [reelle] immanence (and, respectively, transcendence) is only a
special case of the broader concept ofimmanence as such. It is now no longer
obvious and unquestioned that what is absolutely given and what is really

[reell] immanent are one and the same thing; for the general is absolutely
given and yet not really [reel/] immanent. The knowledge of generalities is
itself something singular; it is at any given time a moment in the stream of
consciousness. The general itself, which is given in evidence within the

66

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

stream of consciousness, is, on the other hand, not something singular, but
rather something general, and thus, in the real

[reellen]

sense, transcendent.

As a result, the concept of the phenomenological reduction acquires a more
precise and deeper determination, and a clearer sense: it is not the exclusion
of the really [reell] transcendent (say, in the psychological-empirical sense),
rather it is the exclusion of the transcendent as such, as an existence to be
assumed, that is, everything that is not absolute givenness in the genuine sense
- the absolute givenness of pure seeing. But of course everything else we said
remains the same: validities, actualities, etc., that have been scientifically
induced or deduced, or derived from hypotheses, facts, or axioms, remain
excluded and are permitted only as "phenomena"; and, of course, the same
holds for all recourse to any "knowing"
must restrict itself to

but not, therefore to the really

immanent. For it i s research in the sphere of pure evidence, and, moreover, it
is research into essences. We also said that its field is

absolute self-givenness.

the a priori within

Thus the field is now characterized. It is a field of absolute knowledge,
where the matters of the ego, the world, God, mathematical manifolds, and
any scientific objectivities whatever, remain undecided; a knowledge that is
therefore not dependent on these things, which have their own validity,
whether one is skeptical with respect to them or not. All that remains the
same. What is fundamental is to apprehend the sense ofabsolute givenlless,
the absolute clarity of being given, [ 10] which excludes every meaningful
doubt, in a word, evidence that is absolute seeing and apprehends itself as
such. In a certain sense, the historical signit1cance of the Cartesian meditation
no doubt lies in the discovery of this kind of evidence. But for Descartes, to
discover and to abandon were the same. We do no more than grasp purely and
formulate consistently what is already contained within this age-old intention.
In this connection we have set ourselves against the psychologistic interpreta­
tion of evidence as a feeling.

C. THE THIRD STEP IN THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONSIDERATION
Once again we need a new level of consideration in order to achieve a higher
degree of clarity about the sense of phenomenology and the phenomenological
problematic.
How far does self-givenness extend? Is it confined to the givenness of the

cogitatio

and the ideations that grasp it in its generality? As far as self­

givennes s extends, so far extends our phenomenological sphere, the sphere of
absolute clarity, of immanence in the genuine sense.

We are now led somewhat further into the depths, and in the depths lie
obscurities, and in the obscurities lie the problems.
At first everything seemed quite straightforward, scarcely requiring hard
work on our part. One might cast aside the prejudice of immanence as real

[reeller] immanence, as if it all came down to that, yet, at least in a certain
[reellen] immanence. Initially it appears
that the examination of essence only has to grasp what is really [reell]
immanent in the cogitationes in their generality and to establish the relations
sense, one remains attached to real

that are grounded in essences - an apparently easy matter. One reflects, looks
back upon one ' s own acts, accepts their real

[reellen] contents, just as they

are, only under the phenomenological reduction. This appears to be the only
difficulty. And now there remains nothing else to do but to lift what is s een
into the consciousness of generality.
Things

are

a bit less accommodating, however, once we consider what is

given more closely. First: the

cogitationes, which [ 1 1] we take to be simply

given and therefore entirely unmysterious, conceal all sorts of transcendencies.

rrr we

look closer and now notice how, in the experience of a tone, for

instance, even after the phenomenological reduction the

appearance and that
which appears stand over against each other, and do s o in the midst ofpure
give/mess, that is, within genuine immanence, then we begin to wonder. The
tone lasts for a while; then we have the unity of the tone and its temporal span
with its temporal phases - the now-phase and the past phases - in evident
givenness; on the other hand, when we reflect, the phenomenon of the tone
duration, which is itself a temporal phenomenon, has its own now-phase and
phases of "having been

j And in any now-phase of the phenomenon we might

pick out, what we have before us as an object is not just the now of the tone
itself, for the now of a tone is only a point in the duration of a tone.
Detailed analyses belong to the special tasks we wlll take up in the near
future, but the above indication already suffices to make us aware of some­
thing new: the phenomenon of tone perception, even the evident and reduced
phenomenon, requires a distinction within immanence between the

appear­
ance and that which appears. Thus we have two forms of absolute givenness,
the givenness of the appealing and the givenness of the object - and the object
]
within this. immanence is not immanent in the real [reellen] sense; it is not a
part of the appearance, for tlle past phases of the tone duration are still
objective, and yet they are not really

[reell] contained in the now-point of the

appearance. Thus what we found in the case of the consciousness of generality
- that it is a consciousness that constitutes a self-givenness which is not really

[reellell] contained in it and is not to be found as a cogitatio
the phenomenon of perception.

T H E I D E A OF PHENOMENOLOGY

At the lowest level of consideration, at the naIve stage, it first appears as if
evidence is just plain seeing, a featureless mental look, always one and the
same, bearing no distinctions within itself: seeing sees just things,

[12] things

are simply there, and i n truly evident seeing they are there in consciousness
and seeing simply sees them there. Or to use an image with a different sense:
evidence is a direct grasping, or taking, or pointing to something that simply
is and is there. All distinctions lie in the things, which are for themselves and
have their distinctions by themselves.
Note how different the seeing of things proves to be upon closer analysis.
Even if one still places under title of "attentiveness" an indescribable and
undifferentiated seeing, it still turns out that it makes no sense at all to speak
of things as if they were simply there and need only to be seen. For this
"simply being there" is a matter of certain experiences of a specific and
changing structure, such as perception, imagination, memory, predication,
etc.; and things

are

in them not as they might be in a case or container, rather,

constitute themselves in these experiences even though they are not to
be found in them in the real [reellen] sense. For " things to be given" i s for
them to preseIU themselves (to be represented) as such in these phenomena.
things

And this does not mean that the things are once again there for themselves and

then "send their representatives into consciousness ." Such a thing cannot
happen for us within the sphere of the phenomenological reduction . Rather,
things exist, and exist in appearance, and are themselves given by virtue of
appearance; to be sure, taken individually, they exist, or hold, independently
of appearance - insofar as nothing depends on this particular appearance (on
this consciousness of givenness) - but essentially, according to their essence,
they cannot be separated from appearance.
Thus this wonderful correlation between the phenomenon of knowledge and
the

object of knowledge reveals itself everywhere. And now we note that the

task of phenomenology, or rather the field of its tasks and research, is not such
a trivial thing, as if one would just have to look, just have to open one' s eyes.
Even in the first and simplest cases, in the lowest forms of knowledge, pure
analysis and examination of essence is confronted by the greatest of difficul­
ties. It is easy to speak of the correlation in general terms, but very hard to get
clear on the way in which an object of knowledge constitutes itself in
knowledge.

[13] The task is this: to track down, within the framework of pure
all correlations and forms of givenness, and to

evidence or self-givenness,

elucidate them through analysis. And of course not only particular acts will
come under consideration here, but their complexities, their connections by
way of agreement and disagreement, and the teleologies which emerge from
such connections. These connections are not conglomerations, but rather
unities that are characteristically bound up, congruent as it were, unities of

THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT IN THE LECTURES

knowledge, which, as unified, also have their unified objective correlates.
Thus they belong to acts of knowledge, their types

are

types of knowledge, and

the fonns that inhabit them are forms of thought and forms of intuition (not to
be understood here in the Kantian sense).
At this point it is a matter of tracing, step by step, the forms of givenness

[Gegebenheiten] in all their modifications - the authentic and inauthentic; the
simple and the synthetic; those constituted in one blow, so to speak, and those
that, according to their essence, can only be built up gradu ally; those that are
absolutely valid, and those that, in the process of cognition, only approach
givenness and full validity in an infinite progression.
In this way we finally arrive at an understanding of how the transcendent
real object can be encountered within the act of knowing (i.e., how nature can
be known), first as an obj ect merely intended [gemeint], and how the sense of
this intending [Meinung] is gradually filled out in the continuously developing
context of knowledge (insofar as this context possesses the forms appropriate
to the constitution of an object of experience). We then understand how the
object of experience constitutes itself in a continuum, and how the manner of
this constitution is prescribed to it, in that its essence requires just such a
gradated constitution.
Along this way lie the methodological forms that are determinative of all
the sciences and constitutive of all that is given within the sciences , thus the
elucidation of the theory of science, and hence implicitly the elucidation of all
the sciences: but, of course, only implicitly, since the critique of knowledge
will become capable of being a critique of the particular sciences, and thus
capable of evaluating them metaphysically, only when this enormous work of
elucidation is accomplished.

knowledge is a science of the phenomenon of knowledge in a twofold sense:

as

appearances, presentations, acts of consciousness in

which these or those objectivities are presented, become objects of conscious­
ness, either passively or actively; and, on the other hand, of the objectivities
themselves as objects that present themselves i n just such ways. The meaning
of the word "phenomenon" is twofold because of the essential correlation
between

appearing and that which appears.

"that which appears," and yet it is predominantly used for the appearing itself,
the subjective phenomenon (if one is allowed to use this misleading expres­
sion in a rough psychological sense).
In reflection the

cogitatio, the appearing itself, becomes an object, and this

encourages the development of the equivocation. Finally, it need not be
emphasized again that when we speak of inquiry into the objects of knowledge

70

THE IDEA OF PHENOMENOLOGY

and the modes of knowledge, we always mean inquiry into essences that,
within the sphere of absolute givenness, exhibit in their generality the
definitive sense, the possibility, and the essence of the objectivity of knowl­
edge and of the knowledge of objectivity.
Of course the general phenomenology

of reason has to solve the parallel

problems of the correl ation of evaluation and value, etc. If one uses the word
"phenomenology" so broadly as to include the analysis of all self-givenness,
then even apparently unconnected data would come together: analysis of
sensuous forms of givenness according to their various species, and the like
the common element here is the method of the analysis of essences within
the sphere of immediate evidence.
