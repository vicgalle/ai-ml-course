TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

"Par la date de ces textes, nous voudrions marquer qu'a l'instant, pour les
relier, de les relire, nous ne pouvons nous tenir a egale distance de chacun
d'eux. Ce qui reste ici le deplacement dune question forme certes un systeme. Par
quelque couture interpretative, noun aurions su apres-coup le dessiner. Nous
n'en avons rien laisse paraitre que le pointille, y menageant on y
abandonnant ces blancs sans lesquels aucun texte jamais ne se propose
comme tel. Si texte vent dire tissu, tons ces essais en out obstinement defini la
couture comme faufilure. (Decembre 1966.)" This note originally
appeared appended to the bibliography of L'ecriture et la
difference, a collection of Derrida's essays written between 1959 and
1967 and published as a volume in the latter year. A glance at the list of
sources (p. 445 below) will show that although Derrida has arranged the
essays in order of their original publication, the essay that occupies the
approximate middle of the volume was actually written in 1959, and
therefore precedes the others. Before translating the note-in fact one of
the most difficult passages in the book to translate-let us look at what
Derrida said about the chronology of his works up to 1967 in an interview
with Henri Ronse published in Lettres frangaises, 12 December 1967 and
entitled "Implications." (This interview, along with two others, has
been collected in a small volume entitled Positions, Paris: Editions de
Minuit, 1972.) Hopefully this discussion of chronology

X

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

will serve to orient the reading of Writing and Difference, and to clarify
why the essay that is in many respects the first one-"'Genesis and
Structure' and Phenomenology"-occupies the middle of the volume.
The year 1967 marks Derrida's emergence as a major figure in contemporary French thought. La voix et le phenomene (translated by David
Allison as Speech and Phenomena, Evanston: Northwestern University Press,
1973), a work devoted to analyzing Husserl's ideas about the sign, and
De la grammatologie (translated by Gayatri Spivak as Of Grammatology,
Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976), devoted mainly to
Rousseau's "Essay on the Origin on Languages" seen in the light of the
history of the idea of the sign, both appeared in 1967, along with
L'ecriture et In difference. In response to Ronse's question about how to read
these three books published one on the heels of the other, Derrida first
says that De In grammatologie can be considered a bipartite work in the
middle of which one could insert L'ecriture et In difference. By implication, this
would make the first half of De la grammatologie-in which Derrida
demonstrates the system of ideas which from ancient to modern times
has regulated the notion of the sign-the preface to L'ecriture et In difference. It
would be useful to keep this in mind while reading L'ecriture et la
difference, for while there are many references throughout the essays to
the history of the notion of the sign, these references are nowhere in
this volume as fully explicated as they are in the first half of De la
grammatologie. Derrida explicitly states that the insertion of L'ecriture et la
difference into De In grammatologie would make the second half of the latter, devoted
to Rousseau, the twelfth essay of L'ecriture et la difference. Inversely, Derrida goes
on to say, De la grammatologie can be inserted into the middle of L'ecriture et In
difference, for the first six essays collected in the latter work preceded en fait et
en droit (de facto and de juare-a favorite expression of Derrida's) the
publication, in two issues of Critique (December 1965 and January
1966), of the long essay which was further elaborated into the first part
of De In grammatologie-our preface by implication to L'ecriture et la difference.
The last five essays of L'ecriture et la difference, Derrida states, are situated or
engaged in " l'ouverture grainmatologique," the grammatological opening
(Positions, p. 12). According to Derrida's statements a bit later in the
interview, this
grammatological opening," whose theoretical matrix is elaborated in
the first half of De In grammatologie-which, to restate, systematizes the

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

ideas about the sign, writing and metaphysics which are scattered
throughout L'ecriture et In difference-can be defined as the "deconstruc
tion" of philosophy by examining in the most faithful, rigorous way
the "structured genealogy" of all of philosophy's concepts; and to do
so in order to determine what issues the history of philosophy has
hidden, forbidden, or repressed. The first step of this deconstruction
of philosophy, which attempts to locate that which is present nowhere
in philosophy. i.e., that which philosophy must hide in order to
remain philosophy, is precisely the examination of the notion of presence
as undertaken by Heidegger. Heidegger, says Derrida, recognized in the
notion of presence the "destiny of philosophy," and the reference to
the Heideggerean deconstruction of presence is a constant throughout
Derrida's works. (Indeed, the reader unfamiliar with Heidegger may
well be mystified by Derrida's frequent references to the notion of
presence as the central target in the deconstruction of philosophy.) The
grammatological (from the Greek gramma meaning letter or writing)
opening consists in the examination of the treatment of writing by

philosophy, as a "particularly revelatory symptom" (Positions, p. 15)
both of how the notion of presence functions in philosophy and of
what this notion serves to repress. Derrida arrived at this position
through a close scrutiny of the philosophical genealogy of linguistics,
especially the philosophical treatment of the sign. From Plato to
Heidegger himself, Derrida demonstrates, there is a persistent exclusion
of the notion of writing from the philosophical definition of the sign.
Since this exclusion can always be shown to be made in the name of
presence-the sign allegedly being most present in spoken discourseDerrida
uses it as a "symptom" which reveals the workings of the "repressive"
logic of presence, which determines Western philosophy as such.
Derrida's division of L'ecriture et la difference into two parts, then, serves to
remind the reader that between the sixth and seventh essays a "theoretical
matrix" was elaborated whose principles are to some extent derived
from the first six essays and are more systematically put to work in the
last five. However, I would like to propose another division of the book, a
division between the fifth ("'Genesis and Structure' and Phenomenology")
and sixth essays. My reason for placing the division

at this point stems from what Derrida says about La voix et le phenomene,

XII

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

the other work published in 1967; like this latter work "'Genesis and
Structure' and Phenomenology" is devoted to Husserl. In a "classical
philosophical architecture," Derrida says of the three books published in
1967, La voix et Ie phenomene would have to be read first, for in it is posed,
at a point which he calls "decisive," the "question of the voice and of
phonetic writing in its relationships to the entire history of the West, such
as it may be represented in the history of metaphysics, and in the most
modern, critical and vigilant form of metaphysics: Husserl's transcendental
phenomenology" (Positions, p. 13). Thus La voix et 1e phenomene could be
bound to either De la grammatologie or L'ecriture et In difference, Derrida says, as
a long note.
Where would it be appended to L'ecriture et In difference? In the same
paragraph of the interview Derrida refers to another of his essays on
Husserl, his introduction to his own translation of Husserl's The Origin of
Geometry, published in 1962. He says that the introduction to The Origin of
Geometry is the counterpart of La voix et le phenomene, for the "problematic of
writing was already in place [in the former], as such, and bound to the
irreducible structure of [the verb]'differei [to differ and to defer, or, grossly
put, difference in space and in time] in its relationships to
consciousness, presence, science, history and the history of science, the
disappearance or deferral of the origin, etc." (p. 13). Derrida might
have said that this problematic was already in place in 1959, for a
passage from "'Genesis and Structure' and Phenomenology" poses the
question of writing, again in relation to The Origin of Geometry, in the same terms
employed in the 1967 interview, i.e., in terms of writing and difference:
"Reason, Husserl says, is the logos which is produced in history. It traverses
Being with itself in sight, in order to appear to itself, that is, to state itself and
hear itself as logos .... It emerges from itself in order to take hold of itself
within itself, in the 'living present' of its selfpresence. In emerging from
itself, [logos as] hearing oneself speak constitutes itself as the history of
reason through the detour of writing. Thus it differs from itself in order to
reappropriate itself. The Origin of Geometry describes the necessity of this
exposition of reason in a worldly inscription. An exposition
indispensable to the constitution of truth ... but which is also the danger
to meaning from what is outside the sign [i.e., is neither the acoustic
material used as the signifier, nor the signified concept the sign refers
to]. In the moment of writing, the sign can

always 'empty' itself .............If La voix et le phenomene, then, is the counterpart to
the introduction to The Origin of Geometry, and if it can be attached to L'ecriture
et In difference as a long note, it seems that this would be the place to do so,
for here the general conditions for a deconstruction of metaphysics based
on the notions of writing and difference, and first arrived at through a
reading of how the notion of the sign functions in Husserlian
phenomenology, are explicitly stated. This would make La voix et le
phenomene the sixth essay of a hypothetical twelve in L'ecriture et la difference, but in
the form of a long footnote attached to the middle of the volume.
Chronologically, of course, Derrida's division of L'ecriture et In difference is

references to Kant and Leibniz in the analysis of literary formalism in the
first essay, "Force and Signification."
The conclusion of this brief discussion of chronology with the
metaphor of following a thread through a text brings us to the translation
of the note originally appended to the list of sources in L'ecriture et la
difference. The translation is impossible without commentary, which will be
placed in brackets: "By means of the dates of these texts, we would like to
indicate [marquer: to mark] that in order to bind them together [relier: to put
between covers the pages forming a work, originally by sewing], in
rereading them [relire: relier and relire are anagrams], we cannot maintain
an equal distance from each of them. What remains here the
displacement of a question certainly forms a system. With some interpretive
sewing [couture] we could have sketched this system afterward [apres-coup; in
German nachtrdglich. CE "Freud and the Scene of Writing" for the
analysis of this notion.] We have only permitted isolated points [le
pointille: originally a means of engraving by points] of the system to appear,
deploying or abandoning in it those blank spaces [blancs: Derrida's
analysis of Mallarme, which was to be written in 1969, focuses on the
role of the blunt in the text; see also the epigraph to this volume which
refers to Mallarme's notion of espacement: "the whole without novelty
except a spacing of reading." For the analysis of the blanc and espacement
see "La double seance" in La dissemination, Paris: Seuil, 1972] without which
no text is proposed as such. If text [texte] means cloth (tissu), the word
texte, is derived from the Latin textus, meaning cloth (tissu), and from texere, to
weave (tisser); in English we have text and textile. Derrida comments on this
derivation at the outset of La pharmacie de Platon also in La dissemination.], all
these essays have obstinately defined sewing [couture] as basting [faufilure: the
faux, "false," in fau-filure, or "false stringing," is actually an alteration of
the earlier form of the word, farfrler or fourfiler, from the Latin fors,
meaning outside. Thus basting is sewing on the outside which does
not bind the textile tightly.] (December 1966.)"
The essays of Writing and Difference, then, are less "bound" than
"basted" together. In turn, each essay is "basted" to the material of the
other texts it analyzes, for, as he has stated, Derrida's writing is
"entirely consumed in the reading of other texts." If one reads Writing and
Difference only in order to extract from it a system of deconstruction

which has been our focus so far-one would overlook the persistent
import of Writing and Difference. To repeat Derrida's terms, these essays
always affirm that the "texture" of texts makes any assemblage of
them a "basted" one, i.e., permits only the kind of fore-sewing that
emphasizes the necessary spaces between even the finest stitching. In
practical terms, I would suggest a "basted," well-spaced reading of
Writing and Difference. Instead of reading through the book as a unified, wellsewn volume, one could follow both its arguments and its design in a way
that would make them more comprehensible by choosing any of the essays
to start with, and by reading the major works it refers to. (I have provided
all possible references to English translations of the works in question.)
Derrida is difficult to read not only by virtue of his style, but also because
he seriously wishes to challenge the ideas that govern the way we read.
His texts are more easily grasped if we read them in the way he
implicitly suggests-which is not always the way we are used to reading.
The question arises-and it is a serious one-whether these essays can be
read in a language other than French. It is no exaggeration to say that most
of the crucial passages of L'ecriture et la difference require the same kind of
commentary as was just given for a bibliographical note. Some of the
difficulties can be resolved by warning the reader that Derrida often
refers back to his own works, and anticipates others, without explicitly
saying so; some of these instances have been annotated. This difficulty,
however, is compounded by frequent use of the terminology of classical
philosophy, again without explicit explanation or reference. I will indicate
below some of the terms that appear most frequently in Writing and
Difference; throughout the text I have annotated translations that presented
problems for specific essays, and have also provided some references not
provided by Derrida to works under discussion without specifically being
cited. More important, however, are the general issues raised by the
question of translatability. Derrida always writes with close attention to
the resonances and punning humor of etymology. Occasionally, when
the Greek and Latin inheritances of English and French coincide, this
aspect of Derrida's style can be captured; more often it requires the kind
of laborious annotation (impossible in a volume of this size) provided
above. The translator, constantly aware of what he is sacrificing, is often
tempted to use a language that

XVI TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

is a compromise between English as we know it and English as he
would like it to be in order to capture as much of the original text as
possible. This compromise English, however, is usually comprehensible
only to those who read the translation along with the original. Moreover,
despite Derrida's often dense and elliptical style, he certainly does not write
a compromise French. It has been my experience that however
syntactically complex or lexically rich, there is no sentence in this book
that is not perfectly comprehensible in French-with patience.
Therefore, I have chosen to try to translate into English as we know it.
Sometimes this has meant breaking up and rearranging some very long
sentences. At other times it has been possible to respect the original
syntax and to maintain some very long, complex sentences. Some
etymological word play has been lost, some has been annotated, and
some translated.
These empirical difficulties of translation are, of course, tied to the
question of the sign itself Can any translation be made to signify the same
thing as the original text? How crucial is the play of the signifiersetymological play, stylistic play-to what is signified by the text?
Derrida has addressed himself to this question in the second interview in
Positions (entitled "Semiologie et Grammatologie"). The crux of the question
is the inherited concept that the sign consists of a signifier and a signified,
that is, of a sensible (i.e., relating to the senses, most often hearing) part
which is the vehicle to its intelligible part (its meaning). Derrida states
that the history of metaphysics has never ceased to impose upon
semiology (the science of signs) the search for a "transcendental signified,"
that is, a concept independent of language (p. 30). However, even if the
inherited opposition between signifier and signified can be shown to be
programmed by the metaphysical desire for a transcendental, otherworldly meaning (that is often derived from the theological model of the
presence of God), this does not mean that the opposition between signifier
and signified can simply be abandoned as an historical delusion. Derrida
states: "That this opposition or difference cannot be radical and absolute
does not prevent it from functioning, and even from being indispensable
within certain limits-very wide limits. For example, no translation would
be possible without it. And in fact the theme of a transcendental signified
was constituted within the horizon of an absolutely pure, transparent

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

and unequivocal translatability. Within the limits to which it is possible, or
at least appears possible, translation practices the difference between
signified and signifier. But if this difference is never pure, translation
no more so; and for the notion of translation we would have to substitute
a notion of transformation: a regulated transformation of one language by
another, of one text by another. We will never have, and in fact have never
had, any 'transfer' of pure signifieds-from one language to another,
or within one language-which would be left virgin and intact by the
signifying instrument or 'vehicle' " (Positions, p. 31).
The translator, then, must be sure that he has understood the syntax
and lexicon of the original text in order to let his own language carry
out the work of transformation, Again, this is best facilitated by obeying
the strictures of his language, for a precipitate bending of it into
unaccustomed forms may be indicative more of his own miscomprehension than of difficulties in the original text. In this respect, the
translator's position is analogous to that of the psychoanalyst who

attempts to translate the manifest language of dreams into a latent
language. To do so, the analyst must first be sure that he has understood
the manifest language. As Derrida says in note 3 of "Cogito and the
History of Madness," "The latent content of a dream (and of any
conduct or consciousness in general) communicates with the manifest
content only through the unity of a language; a language which the
analyst, then, must speak as well as possible." The discussion of terms
offered below, and the translator's footnotes in the text, are an attempt to
provide a guide to the "manifest" language of Writing and Difference. Like
the analyst, however, the reader must let his attention float, and be
satisfied with a partial understanding of a given essay on any particular
reading. As the manifest language begins to become more familiar, the
persistence of the "latent" content-what Derrida has called "the
unconscious of philosophical opposition" (Positions, p. 60, note 6; my italics)will become a surer guide, a more salient thread in the weave of these
texts.

Derrida's terms. Wherever Derrida uses diderance as a neologism I have left it
untranslated. Its meanings are too multiple to be explained here fully, but
we may note briefly that the word combines in neither the active nor
the passive voice the coincidence of meanings in the verb differer: to

differ (in space) and to defer (to put off in time, to postpone presence).
Thus, it does not function simply either as difference (difference) or as
differance in the usual sense (deferral), and plays on both meanings at
once. Derrida's 1968 lecture "La differance" (reprinted in Marges, Paris:
Editions de Minuit, 1972) is indispensable here. Throughout Writing and
Difference Derrida links the concept of differance to his play on the words
totalitarian and solicitation. He sees structuralism as a form of philosophical
totalitarianism, i.e., as an attempt to account for the totality of a
phenomenon by reduction of it to a formula that governs it totally. Derrida
submits the violent, totalitarian structural project to the counterviolence of
solicitation, which derives from the Latin sollicitare, meaning to shake the
totality (from sollus, "all," and ciere, "to move, to shake"), Every totality,
he shows, can be totally shaken, that is, can be shown to be founded on that
which it excludes, that which would be in excess for a reductive analysis
of any kind. (The English solicit should be read in this etymological sense
wherever it appears.) This etymological metaphor covering a
philosophical-political violence is also implied in the notion of archia
(archie in French; also a neologism). Archia derives from the Greek
arche, which combines the senses of a founding, original principle and
of a government by one controlling principle. (Hence, for example, the
etymological link between archeology and monarchy.) Philosophy is
founded on the principle of the archia, on regulation by true, original
principles; the deconstruction of philosophy reveals the differential excess
which makes the archia possible. This excess is often posed as an aporia, the
Greek word for a seemingly insoluble logical difficulty: once a system has
been "shaken" by following its totalizing logic to its final consequences,
one finds an excess which cannot be construed within the rules of
logic, for the excess can only be conceived as neither this nor that, or both at
the same time-a departure from all rules of logic. Difference often functions
as an aporia: it is difference in neither time nor space and makes both
possible.
Ousia and parousia are the Greek words for being governed by presence;
parousia also contains the sense of reappropriation of presence in a second
coming of Christ. Epekeina tes ousias is the Platonic term for the beyond of'
being; Derrida has often used this concept as a steppingstone in his
deconstructions. Signified and signifier have been explained

above. Derrida also consistently plays on the derivation of seas (meaning
or sense; Sinn in German) which includes both a supposedly intelligible,
rational sense (a signified meaning) and a vehicle dependent on the senses
for its expression (the signifier). Further, in French sens also means direction;
to lose meaning is to lose direction, to be lost, to feel that one is in a
labyrinth. I have inflected the translation of sens to conform to its play
of meanings wherever possible.
Heidegger's terms. While the concept of Being belongs to the entire metaphysical tradition, its translation into English has become particularly
difficult since Heidegger's analyses of it. German and French share the
advantage that their infinitives meaning to be (sein, etre) can also be used as
substantives that mean Being in general. Further, in each language the
present participle of the infinitive (seiend, etant) can also be used as a
substantive meaning particular beings. No such advantage exists in English,
and since Heidegger is always concerned with the distinction between
Sein (etre, Being in general) and Seiendes (etant, beings) the correct
translation of these substantives becomes the first problem for any
consideration of Heidegger in English. (The verb forms present no
difficulties: sent and etre as infinitives become to be, and the gerunds seiend and
etant become being.) I have followed the practice of John Macquarrie and
Edward Robinson in their translation of Being and Time (New York: Harper
and Row, 1962) and have translated the substantive (derived from the
infinitive) Sein (etre) as "Being" (with a capital initial) wherever it appears
in this volume. However I have modified their translation of Seiendes
(etant)-the substantive from the present participle-as "entity" or
"entities," and have translated it as "being" or "beings." Macquarrie and
Robinson, in fact, state that "there is much to be said" for this translation
(Being and Time, p. 22, note I). I feel that it is preferable to "entity" not
only because, as they state, "in recent British and American philosophy
the term 'entity' has been used more generally to apply to anything
whatsoever, no matter what its ontological status" (ibid.), but also
because "entity" derives from ens, the Latin present participle for the
verb to be, else. No one has been more attentive than Heidegger to the
difficulties caused by the translation of Greek thought into Latin. The
Latin inheritance of "entity" continues the tradition of these difficulties.
Once more, we face the problem of

XX

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

the transformation of one language by another. There is one major exception to
the translation of etant by "being," and this is in Violence and Metaphysics,
Derrida's essay on Emmanuel Levinas. The major work by Levinas under
consideration in this essay, Totalite et Infini, has been translated into English.
Since much of this work is concerned with Heidegger, I have maintained
the translation of etant as "existent"-the solution chosen by Alphonso
Lingis, the translator of Totality and Infinityin all citations from this work.
This translation is particularly problematical in that it tends to confuse the
distinction (in terms of Being and Time) between the existential, ontological
status of Being, and the ontical status of being. The reader is requested to
read "being" for "existent" wherever the latter appears.
This brings us to another term, one from Heidegger's later thoughtthat of difference. From the existential analytic of Daseinman's Being-in
Being and Time, Heidegger moved to a contemplation of the difference
between beings and Being in his later works. He calls this the onticoontological difference, and this idea itself is submitted to powerful scrutiny in his
Identity and Difference. The title of this work alone should bring it to the
attention of the serious reader of Writing and Difference; in the introduction
to "Freud and the Scene of Writing" Derrida gives a brief indication of the
importance of Identity and Difference to Writing and Difference when he speaks
of "differance and identity," "differance as the preopening of the ontico-ontological
difference." From Identity and Difference also comes the term onto-theology
which characterizes Western metaphysics as such. Very roughly put,
Heidegger analyzes the contradictions of the logic of presence which is
forced to conceive Being as the most general attribute of existence
(onto-), and as the "highest," most specific attribute of God (theo-). Logos
is the true verb: the spoken discourse in which the notion of truth
governed by this onto-theo-logy of presence is revealed. Also from identity and
Difference, among other places in Heidegger, comes the concept of
difference as it is inscribed in the
"ontological double genitive," i.e., the necessary fluctuation of the
subjective and objective cases in order to speak of Being, which always
means the Being of beings and the beings of Being.
From Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, the work which immediately
follows Being and Time, comes the term "auto-affection, which Derrida
uses often, and which I have discussed briefly in note 25 of "'Genesis

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION XX

and Structure' and Phenomenology." Briefly here too, "auto-affection"
refers to the classical notion of time as a self-produced, infinite chain of
present moments that also, as scrutinized by Kant and Heidegger,
causes some problems for the traditional opposition of senses and
intellect: does time belong to the sensible or the intelligible? From
Heidegger's extended confrontation with Nietzsche's doctrine of the will
comes the concept of voluntarism. Throughout Writing and Difference
"voluntarism" must be read in its etymological sense of "doctrine of the
will," deriving as it does from the Latin volumes (whence our "volition").
The French vouloir, to want, maintains its etymological resonances in more
striking fashion than do any of its English equivalents; Derrida plays on
these resonances especially in connection with vouloir dire, which
means either "meaning" or "to mean," but has a strong connotation of
"the will to say." The concluding paragraphs of "Cogito and the History of
Madness" develop this point.
Husserl's terms. The most important terms from Husserl are the linked
concepts of bracketing, epoche, and the phenomenological reduction.
These are carefully explained in sections 31, 32, and 33 of Ideas (translated
by W R. Boyce Gibson, New York: Macmillan, 1962). Husserl, following
Descartes's attempt to find absolutely certain truths by putting everything
into doubt, proposes to put between brackets (or parentheses) "the general
thesis which belongs to the essence of the natural standpoint." This
phenomenological "abstention" (epoche) prohibits the use of any
"judgment that concerns spatio-temporal existence" (Ideas, p. 100).
"Pure consciousness" becomes accessible through this transcendental
epoche, which Husserl therefore speaks of as the phenomenological
reduction. The relationship of this "pure consciousness" to "pure
essences" is governed by intentionality, for all consciousness is
consciousness of something, although again it is not a question of a
relationship to a psychological event (experience) or to a real object.
Sensory experience, the relationship to hyle (matter) contains nothing
intentional for Husserl; it is intentional morphe (form, shape) which
bestows meaning on sensory experience. The opposition of hyle to
morphe (matter to form) leads Husserl to divide "phenomenological
being" into its hyletic and noetic (intentionally meaningful; from the
Greek nous, meaning mind or spirit) sides. The pure form of the noesis is

XXII TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

in noema, which Husserl construes as the immanent meaning of perception,
judgment, appreciation, etc. in the "pure," i.e., phenomenologically
reduced, form of these experiences themselves. As much of ideas is
concerned with the theory of noetic-noematic structures, the reader will
appreciate the inadequacy of these remarks.
Hegel's terms. The most important term from Hegel, Aufhebung, is untranslatable
due to its double meaning of conservation and negation. (The various
attempts to translate Aufhebung into English seem inadequate.) The reader is
referred to Derrida's discussion of the term in "Violence and
Metaphysics," section III, first subsection ("Of the Original Polemic),
B, and to the translator's notes in "From Restricted to General Economy,"
where other terms from Hegel are discussed. The Hegelian figure of the
"unhappy consciousness" is discussed in note 23 of Violence and
Metaphysics, but there is also an important discussion of it at the beginning of
"Cogito and the History of Madness." The unhappy consciousness, for
Hegel, is always divided against itself; its historical figure is Abraham, the
prototype of the "Jewish" consciousness for which there is an intrinsic
conflict between God and nature. In many ways the theme of the unhappy
consciousness runs throughout Writing and Difference. "Violence and
Metaphysics" is epigraphically submitted to the conflict between the
Greek-"happy," at one with nature-and the Hebraic-unhappyconsciousnesses. Like all inherited oppositions, this one too is
programmed by the logic of presence which demands a choice
between the terms, or a resolution of the conflict. Derrida pushes the
unhappy consciousness to its logical limits in order to bring it to the point
where the division within it becomes irreducible. This occurs most
importantly in the two essays devoted to Jabes, whose poetry
interrogates the meaning of the Jewish, divided consciousness. This
interrogation becomes particularly poignant for Derrida in its ties to the
Jewish, unhappy consciousness as the experience of the (people of the)
Book and Writing, for, as discussed above, these are the inherited
concepts which are Derrida's central targets. Derrida has closed each of
the essays on Jabes with the name of one of Jabes's imaginary rabbis:
Rica and Derissa. In this way he alerts us to the "latent," philosophically
"unconscious" impact of Writing and Difference: an expanded concept of
difference through the examination of writing.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION XXI11

Derrida's rebus-like play on his own name across this volume reminds us
how unlike the Book this one is.
All Greek terms have been transliterated. Unless the English translation of a
French or German text is specifically referred to, citations of texts in these
languages are of my own translation. I owe a debt of thanks to Professor
Richard Macksey of the Johns Hopkins University for the assistance he
offered me at the outset of this project, and for his generous permission to
revise his own fine translation of "Structure, Sign and Play in the
Discourse of the Human Sciences." Most of the translation of this essay
belongs to Professor Macksey. I consulted Jeffrey Mehlman's
translation of "Freud and the Scene of Writing," which appeared in Yale
French Studies, no. 48 (1972). And I have also profited greatly from the
careful scholarship of Rodolphe Gasche's German translation of L'ecriture et
In difference (Die Schrift and Die Differenz, Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1972).

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION
It might be that we are all tattooed savages since Sophocles.
But there is more to Art than the straightness of lines and the
perfection of surfaces. Plasticity of style is not as large as the
entire idea.... We have too many things and not enough forms.
(Flaubert, Preface d la d'tcrivain)
If it recedes one day, leaving behind its works and signs on the shores of
our civilization, the structuralist invasion might become a question for
the historian of ideas, or perhaps even an object. But the historian would
be deceived if he came to this pass: by the very act of considering the
structuralist invasion as an object he would forget its meaning and
would forget that what is at stake, first of all, is an adventure of
vision, a conversion of the way of putting questions to any object
posed before us, to historical objects-his own-in particular. And,
unexpectedly among these, the literary object.
By way of analogy: the fact that universal thought, in all its domains, by
all its pathways and despite all differences, should be receiving a
formidable impulse from an anxiety about language-which can only be
an anxiety of language, within language itself-is a strangely concerted
development; and it is the nature of this development not to be

able to display itself in its entirety as a spectacle for the historian, if, by
chance, he were to attempt to recognize in it the sign of an epoch, the
fashion of a season, or the symptom of a crisis. Whatever the poverty of our
knowledge in this respect, it is certain that the question of the sign is itself
more or less, or in any event something other, than a sign of the times. To
dream of reducing it to a sign of the times is to dream of violence. Especially
when this question, an unexpectedly historical one, approaches the point at
which the simple significative nature of language appears rather uncertain,
partial, or inessential. It will be granted readily that the analogy between
the structuralist obsession and the anxiety of language is not a chance
one. Therefore, it will never be possible, through some second- or thirdhand reflection, to make the structuralism of the twentieth century (and
particularly the structuralism of literary criticism, which has eagerly joined
the trend) undertake the mission that a structuralist critic has assigned to
himself for the nineteenth century: to contribute to a "future history of
imagination and affectivity."I Nor will it be possible to reduce the
fascination inherent in the notion of structure to a phenomenon of
fashion,' except by reconsidering and taking seriously the meanings of
imagination, affectivity, and fashion-doubtless the more urgent task. In
any event, if some aspect of structuralism belongs to the domains of
imagination, affectivity, or fashion, in the popular sense of these words,
this aspect will never be the essential one. The structuralist
stance, as well as our own attitudes assumed before or within language,
are not only moments of history. They are an astonishment rather, by
language as the origin of history. By historicity itself. And also, when
confronted by the possibility of speech and always already within it,
the finally acknowledged repetition of a surprise finally extended to the
dimensions of world culture-a surprise incomparable to any other, a
surprise responsible for the activation of what is called Western
thought, the thought whose destiny is to extend its domains while the
boundaries of the West are drawn back. By virtue of its innermost
intention, and like all questions about language, structuralism escapes
the classical history of ideas which already supposes structuralism's
possibility, for the latter naively belongs to the province of language
and propounds itself within it.
Nevertheless, by virtue of an irreducible region of irreflection and

spontaneity within it, by virtue of the essential shadow of the undeclared,
the structuralist phenomenon will deserve examination by the historian of
ideas. For better or for worse. Everything within this phenomenon that
does not in itself transparently belong to the question of the sign will
merit this scrutiny; as will everything within it that is methodologically
effective, thereby possessing the kind of infallibility now ascribed to
sleepwalkers and formerly attributed to instinct, which was said to be as
certain as it was blind. It is not a lesser province of the social science called
history to have a privileged concern, in the acts and institutions of man,
with the immense region of somnambulism, the almost-everything which is
not the pure waking state, the sterile and silent acidity of the question itself,
the almost-nothing.'
Since we take nourishment from the fecundity of structuralism, it is too
soon to dispel our dream. We must muse upon what it might signify from
within it. In the future it will be interpreted, perhaps, as a relaxation, if
not a lapse, of the attention given to force, which is the tension of force
itself Form fascinates when one no longer has the force to understand
force from within itself That is, to create. This is why literary criticism
is structuralist in every age, in its essence and destiny. Criticism has not
always known this, but understands it now, and thus is in the process of
thinking itself in its own concept, system and method. Criticism
henceforth knows itself separated from force, occasionally avenging
itself on force by gravely and profoundly proving that separation is the
condition of the work, and not only of the discourse on the work.' Thus
is explained the low note, the melancholy pathos that can be perceived
behind the triumphant cries of technical ingenuity or mathematical
subtlety that sometimes accompany certain so-called "structural" analyses.
Like melancholy for Gide, these analyses are possible only after a certain
defeat of force and within the movement of diminished ardor. Which
makes the structural consciousness consciousness in general, as a
conceptualization of the past, I mean of facts in general. A reflection of the
accomplished, the constituted, the constructed. Historical, eschatalogical, and
crepuscular by its very situation.
But within structure there is not only form, relation, and configuration.
There is also interdependency and a totality which is always concrete.
In literary criticism, the structural "perspective" is, according

to Jean-Pierre Richard's expression, "interrogative and totalitarian."5 The force
of our weakness is that impotence separates, disengages, and emancipates.
Henceforth, the totality is more clearly perceived, the panorama and the
panoramagram are possible. The panoramagram, the very image of the
structuralist instrument, was invented in 1824, as Littre states, in order "to obtain
immediately, on a flat surface, the development of depth vision of objects on the
horizon." Thanks to a more or less openly acknowledged schematization and
spatialization, one can glance over the field divested of its forces more freely or
diagrammatically. Or one can glance over the totality divested of its forces, even
if it is the totality of form and meaning, for what is in question, in this case, is
meaning rethought as form; and structure is the formal unity of form and
meaning. It will be said that this neutralization of meaning by form is the author's
responsibility before being the critic's, and to a certain extent-but it is just this
extent which is in question-this is correct. In any event, the project of a
conceptualization of totality is more easily stated today, and such a project in and
of itself escapes the determined totalities of classical history. For it is the project
of exceeding them. Thus, the relief and design of structures appears more clearly
when content, which is the living energy of meaning, is neutralized. Somewhat
like the architecture of an uninhabited or deserted city, reduced to its skeleton by
some catastrophe of nature or art. A city no longer inhabited, not simply left
behind, but haunted by meaning and culture. This state of being haunted, which
keeps the city from returning to nature, is perhaps the general mode of the
presence or absence of the thing itself in pure language. The pure language that
would be housed in pure literature, the object of pure literary criticism. Thus it is
in no way paradoxical that the structuralist consciousness is a catastrophic
consciousness, simultaneously destroyed and destructive, destructuring, as is all
consciousness, or at least the moment of decadence, which is the period proper to
all movement of consciousness. Structure is perceived through the incidence of
menace, at the moment when

]ability. This operation is called (from the Latin) soliciting. In other words,
shaking in a way related to the whole (from sollus, in archaic Latin "the whole,"
and from citare, "to put in motion"). The structuralist solicitude and solicitation
give themselves only the illusion of technical liberty when they become
methodical. In truth, they reproduce, in the register of method, a solicitude and
solicitation of Being, a historicometaphysical threatening of foundations. It is
during the epochs of historical dislocation, when we are expelled from the site,
that this structuralist passion, which is simultaneously a frenzy of experimentation and a proliferation of schernatizations, develops for itself The baroque
would only be one example of it. Has not a "structural poetics" "founded on a
rhetoric"6 been mentioned in relation to the baroque? But has not a "burst
structure" also been spoken of, a "rent poem whose structure appears as it bursts
apart "?7
The liberty that this critical (in all the senses of this word)" disengagement
assures us of, therefore, is a solicitude for and an opening into totality. But what
does this opening hide? And hide, not by virtue of what it leaves aside and out
of sight, but by virtue of its very power to illuminate. One continually asks
oneself this question in reading Jean Rousset's fine book: Forme et
signification: Essais sur les structures litteraires de Corneille d Claudel.9 Our
question is not a reaction against what others have called "ingenuity" and what
seems to us, except in a few instances, to be something more and something
better. Confronted by this series of brilliant and penetrating exercises intended
to illustrate a method, it is rather a question of unburdening ourselves of a mute
anxiety, and of doing so at the point at which this anxiety is not only ours, the
reader's, but also seems to conform, beneath the language, operations, and
greatest achievements of this book, to the anxiety of
y the author himself

imminent danger concentrates our vision on the keystone of an institu
tion, the stone which encapsulates both the possibility and the fragility
of its existence. Structure then can be methodically threatened in order to
Rousset certainly acknowledges kinships and affiliations: Bachelard,
a. Poulet, Raymond, Picon, Starobinski, Richard, etc. However, despite the
' familial air, the many borrowings and numerous respectful acknowledgments,
Forme et Signification seems to us, in many respects, a solitary

be comprehended more clearly and to reveal not only its supports but
also that secret place in which it is neither construction nor ruin but

attempt.
In the first place, this is due to a deliberate difference. Rousset does not
isolate himself within this difference, keeping his distance; rather, he
scrupulously examines a community of intentions by bringing to the

6

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

surface enigmas hidden beneath values that are today accepted and
respected-modern values they may be, but values already traditional
enough to have become the commonplaces of criticism, making them,
therefore, open to reflection and suspicion. Rousset presents his theses
a remarkable methodological introduction that, along with the
introduction to I'Univers imaginaire de Mallarme, should become an important
part of the discourse on method in literary criticism. In multiplying his
introductory references Rousset does not muddle his discourse but, on the
contrary, weaves a net that tightens its originality.
For example: that in the literary fact language is one with meaning, that
form belongs to the content of the work; that, according to the
expression of Gaeton Picon, "for modern art, the work is not expression
but creation" `-these are propositions that gain unanimous
acceptance only by means of a highly equivocal notion of form or
expression. The same goes for the notion of imagination, the power of
mediation or synthesis between meaning and literality, the common root
of the universal and the particular-as of all other similarly dissociated
couples-the obscure origin of these structural frameworks and of the
empathy between "form and content" which makes possible both the work
and the access to its unity. For Kant, the imagination was already in
itself an "art," was art itself, which originally did not distinguish between
truth and beauty; and despite all the differences, Kant speaks of the same
imagination in the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of judgment as does
Rousset. It is art, certainly, but a "hidden art" I' that cannot be "revealed to the
eyes ."1z "Now since the reduction of a representation of the imagination
to concepts is equivalent to giving its exponents, the aesthetic idea may
be called an inexponible representation of the imagination (in its free
play)."" Imagination is the freedom that reveals itself only in its works.
These works do not exist within nature, but neither do they inhabit a world
other than ours.
"The imagination (as a productive faculty of cognition) is a powerful
agent for creating, as it were, a second nature out of the material
supplied to it by actual nature."" This is why intelligence is not neces
sarily the essential faculty of the critic when he sets out to encounter
imagination and beauty; "in what we call beautiful, intelligence is at
the service of the imagination, and the latter is not at the service of
intelligence."" For "the freedom of the imagination consists precisely

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

7

in the fact that it schematizes without a concept."" This enigmatic
origin of the work as a structure and indissociable unity-and as an
object for structuralist criticism-is, according to Kant, "the first thing
to which we must pay attention."" According to Rousset also. From his
first page on, he links "the nature of the literary fact," always insuffi
ciently examined, to the "role in art of imagination, that fundamental
activity" about which "uncertainties and oppositions abound." This
notion of an imagination that produces metaphor-that is, everything in
language except the verb to be-remains for critics what certain philo
sophers today call a naively utilized operative concept. To surmount this
technical ingenuousness is to reflect the operative concept as a thematic
concept. This seems to be one of Rousset's projects.
To grasp the operation of creative imagination at the greatest pos
sible proximity to it, one must turn oneself toward the invisible
interior of poetic freedom. One must be separated from oneself in
order to be reunited with the blind origin of the work in its darkness.
This experience of conversion, which founds the literary act (writing
or reading), is such that the very words "separation" and "exile,"
which always designate the interiority of a breaking-off with the world
and a making of one's way within it, cannot directly manifest the
experience; they can only indicate it through a metaphor whose
genealogy itself would deserve all of our efforts." For in question here
is a departure from the world toward a place which is neither a non-place
nor an other world, neither a utopia nor an alibi, the creation of "a
universe to be added to the universe," according to an expression of
Focillon's cited by Rousset (Forme et Signification, p. 11). This universe
articulates only that which is in excess of everything, the essential
nothing on whose basis everything can appear and be produced within
language; and the voice of Maurice Blanchot reminds us, with the
insistence of profundity, that this excess is the very possibility of writing
and of literary inspiration in general. Only pure absence-not the absence of

this or that, but the absence of everything in which all presence is
announced-can inspire, in other words, can work, and then make one
work. The pure book naturally turns toward the eastern edge of this
absence which, beyond or within the prodigiousness of all wealth, is its
first and proper content. The pure book, the book itself, by virtue of what is
most irreplaceable within it, must be the "book about nothing"

8

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

that Flaubert dreamed of-a gray, negative dream, the origin of the total
Book that haunted other imaginations. This emptiness as the situation of
literature must be acknowledged by the critic as that which constitutes the
specificity of his object, as that around which he always speaks. Or rather; his
proper object-since nothing is not an object-is the way in which this
nothing itself is determined by disappearing. It is the transition to the
determination of the work as the disguising of its origin. But the
origin is possible and conceivable only in disguise. Rousset shows us
the extent to which spirits as diverse as Delacroix, Balzac, Flaubert,
Valery, Proust, T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and many others had a sure
consciousness of this. A sure and certain consciousness, although in
principle not a clear and distinct one, as there is not intuition of a thing
involved." To these voices should be added that of Antonin Artaud, who
was less roundabout: "I made my debut in literature by writing books in
order to say that I could write nothing at all. My thoughts, when I had
something to say or write, were that which was furthest from me. I never
had any ideas, and two short books, each seventy pages long, are about
this profound, inveterate, endemic absence of any idea. These books are
I'Ombilic des limbes and le Pese-nerfs.Â°20 The consciousness of having
something to say as the consciousness of nothing: this is not the poorest,
but the most oppressed of consciousnesses. It is the consciousness of
nothing, upon which all consciousness of something enriches itself,
takes on meaning and shape. And upon whose basis all speech can be
brought forth. For the thought of the thing as what it is has already been
confused with the experience of pure speech; and this experience has
been confused with experience

itself. Now, does not pure speech require inscription21 somewhat in the
manner that the Leibnizian essence requires existence and pushes on
toward the world, like power toward the act? If the anguish of writing is
not and must not be a determined pathos, it is because this anguish is not an
empirical modification or state of the writer, but is the responsi
bility of angustia:22 the necessarily restricted passageway of speech
against which all possible meanings push each other, preventing each
other's emergence. Preventing, but calling upon each other, provoking"
each other too, unforeseeably and as if despite oneself, in a kind of
autonomous overassemblage of meanings, a power of pure equivocal
ity that makes the creativity of the classical God appear all too poor

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

Speaking frightens me because, by never saying enough, I also say too
rnuch. And if the necessity of becoming breath or speech restricts
meaning-and our responsibility for it-writing restricts and con
strains speech further still." Writing is the anguish of the Hebraic
ruah,Z4 experienced in solitude by human responsibility; experienced
by Jeremiah subjected to God's dictation ("Take thee a roll of a book,
and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee"), or by
Baruch transcribing Jeremiah's dictation (Jeremiah 36:2,4); or further,
within the properly human moment of pneumatology, the science of
pneuma, spiritus, or logos which was divided into three parts: the divine,
the angelical and the human. It is the moment at which we must decide
whether we will engrave what we hear. And whether engraving pre
serves or betrays speech. God, the God of Leibniz, since we have just
spoken of him, did not know the anguish of the choice between vari
ous possibilities: he conceived possible choices in action and disposed
of them as such in his Understanding or Logos; and, in any event, the
narrowness of a passageway that is Will favors the "best" choice. And each
existence continues to "express" the totality of the Universe. There is,
therefore, no tragedy of the book. There is only one Book, and this same
Book is distributed throughout all books. In the Theodicy, Theodorus,
who "had become able to confront the divine radiancy of the daughter of
Jupiter," is led by her to the "palace of the fates;" in this palace "Jupiter,
having surveyed them before the beginning of the existing world,
classified the possibilities into worlds, and chose the best of ail. He comes
sometimes to visit these places, to enjoy the pleasure of recapitulating
things and of renewing his own choice, which cannot fail to please
him." After being told all

this by Pallas, Theodorus is led into a hall which "was a world."
"There was a great volume of writings in this hall: Theodorus could not
world which we are now visiting, the Goddess told him; it is the book
of its fates. You have seen a number on the forehead of Sextus. Look in
this book for the place which it indicates. Theodorus looked
for it, and found there the history of Sextus in a form more ample titan
the outline he had seen. Put your finger on any line you please,
detail that which the line broadly indicates. He obeyed, and he saw

coming into view all the characteristics of a portion of the life of that
Sextus."25
To write is not only to conceive the Leibnizian book as an impossible
possibility. Impossible possibility, the limit explicitly named by Mallarme.
To Verlaine: "I will go even further and say: the Book, for I am convinced
that there is only One, and that it has [unwittingly] been attempted by
every writer, even by Geniuses."26 " ... revealing that, in general, all books
contain the amalgamation of a certain number of age-old truths; that
actually there is only one book on earth, that it is the law of the earth,
the earth's true Bible. The difference between individual works is simply
the difference between individual interpretations of one true and
established text, which are proposed in a mighty gathering of those ages
we call civilized or literary."" To write is not only to know that the Book
does not exist and that forever there are books, against which the
meaning of a world not conceived by an absolute subject is shattered,
before it has even become a unique meaning; nor is it only to know that
the non-written and the non-read cannot be relegated to the status of
having no basis by the obliging negativity of some dialectic, making us
deplore the absence of the Book
from under the burden of "too many texts!" It is not only to have lost
the theological certainty of seeing every page bind itself into the
unique text of the truth, the "book of reason" as the journal in which
accounts (rationes) and experiences consigned for Memory was for
merly called," the genealogical anthology, the Book of Reason this
time, the infinite manuscript read by a God who, in a more or less
deferred way, is said to have given us use of his pen. This lost certainty,
this absence of divine writing, that is to say, first of all, the absence of

the Jewish God (who himself writes, when necessary), does not solely
and vaguely define something like "modernity." As the absence and
haunting of the divine sign, it regulates all modern criticism and aes
thetics. There is nothing astonishing about this. "Consciously or not,"
says Georges Canguilhem, "the idea that man has of his poetic power
corresponds to the idea he has about the creation of the world; and to
the solution he gives to the problem of the radical origin of things. If
the notion of creation is equivocal, ontological and aesthetic, it is not
so by chance or confusion. "29 To write is not only to know that
through writing, through the extremities of style, the best will not

11

necessarily transpire, as Leibniz thought it did in divine creation, nor will
the transition to what transpires always be willful, nor will that which is
noted down always infinitely express the universe, resembling and
reassembling it." It is also to be incapable of making meaning
absolutely precede writing: it is thus to lower meaning while simultaneously elevating inscription. The eternal fraternity of theological optimism
and of pessimism: nothing is more reassuring, but nothing is more
despairing, more destructive of our books than the Leibnizian Book. On
what could books in general live, what would they be if they were not alone,
so alone, infinite, isolated worlds? To write is to know that what has not
yet been produced within literality has no other dwelling place, does not
await us as prescription in some topos ouranios, or some divine
understanding. Meaning must await being said or written in order to inhabit
itself, and in order to become, by differing from itself, what it is: meaning.
This is what Husserl teaches us to think in The Origin of Geometry. The
literary act thus recovers its true power at its source. In a fragment of a book
he intended to devote to The Origin of Truth, Merleau-Ponty wrote:
"Communication in literature is not the simple appeal on the part of the
writer to meanings which would be part of an a priori of the mind; rather,
communication arouses these meanings in the mind through enticement
and a kind of oblique action. The writer's thought does not control his
language from without; the writer is himself a kind of new idiom,
constructing itself"" "My own words take me by surprise and teach me
what I think,"32 he said elsewhere.
It is because writing is inaugural, in the fresh sense of the word, that it is
dangerous and anguishing. It does not know where it is going, no
knowledge can keep it from the essential precipitation toward the
meaning that it constitutes and that is, primarily, its future. However, it is
capricious only through cowardice. There is thus no insurance against
the risk of writing. Writing is an initial and graceless recourse for the
writer, even if he is not an atheist but, rather, a writer. Did Saint John
Chrysostom speak of the writer? "It were indeed meet for us not at all to
require the aid of the written Word, but to exhibit a life so pure, that
the grace of the spirit should be instead of books to our souls, and that
as these are inscribed with ink, even so should our hearts be with the
Spirit. But, since we have utterly put away from us

12 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

this grace, come let us at any rate embrace the second best course." 33 But,
all faith or theological assurance aside, is not the experience of
secondarily tied to the strange redoubling by means of which
constituted-written-meaning presents itselfas prerequisitely and simultaneously read: and does not meaning present itself as such at the point
at which the other is found, the other who maintains both the vigil and
the back-and-forth motion, the work, that comes between writing and
reading, making this work irreducible? Meaning is neither before nor after
the act. Is not that which is called God, that which imprints every
human course and recourse with its secondarity, the passageway of
deferred reciprocity between reading and writing? or the absolute
witness to the dialogue in which what one sets out to write has already
been read, and what one sets out to say is already a response, the third
party as the transparency of meaning? Simultaneously part of creation and
the Father of Logos. The circularity and traditionality of Logos. The strange
labor of conversion and adventure in which grace can only be that which is
missing.
Thus, the notion of an idea or "interior design" as simply anterior to a
work which would supposedly be the expression of it, is a prejudice: a
prejudice of the traditional criticism called idealist. It is not by
chance that this theory-or, one could now say, this theology-flowered
during the Renaissance. Rousset, like so many others past or present,
certainly speaks out against this "Platonism" or "Neo-Platonism." But he
does not forget that if creation by means of "the form rich in ideas"
(Valery) is not the purely transparent expression of this form, it is
nevertheless, simultaneously, revelation. If creation were not revelation,
what would happen to the finitude of the writer and to the solitude of
his hand abandoned by God? Divine creativity, in this case, would be
reappropriated by a hypocritical humanism. If writing is inaugural it is not so
because it creates, but because of a certain absolute freedom of speech,
because of the freedom to bring forth the already-there as a sign of the
freedom to augur. A freedom of response which acknowledges as its
only horizon the world as history and the speech which can only say:
Being has always already begun. To create is to reveal, says Rousset, who does
not turn his back on classical criticism. He comprehends it, rather, and
enters into dialogue with it: "Prerequisite secret and unmasking of
this secret by the work: a reconciliation of ancient and modern aesthet

ics can be observed, in a certain way, in the possible correspondence of the
preexisting secret to the Idea of the Renaissance thinkers stripped of all NeoPlatonism."
This revelatory power of true literary language as poetry is indeed the
access to free speech, speech unburdened of its signalizing functions by
the word "Being" (and this, perhaps, is what is aimed at beneath the
notion of the "primitive word" or the "theme-word," Leitwort, of Buber).34
It is when that which is written is deceased as a signsignal that it is born as
language; for then it says what is, thereby referring only to itself, a sign
without signification, a game or pure functioning, since it ceased to be
utilized as natural, biological, or technical information, or as the transition
from one existent to another, from a signifier to a signified. And,
paradoxically, inscription alonealthough it is far from always doing sohas the power of poetry, in other words has the power to arouse speech
from its slumber as sign. By enregistering speech, inscription has as its
essential objective, and indeed takes this fatal risk, the emancipation of
meaning-as concerns any actual field of perception-from the natural
predicament in which everything refers to the disposition of a contingent
situation. This is why writing will never be simple "voice-painting"
(Voltaire). It creates meaning by enregistering it, by entrusting it to an
engraving, a groove, a relief, to a surface whose essential characteristic is
to be infinitely transmissible. Not that this characteristic is always desired,
nor has it always been; and writing as the origin of pure historicity, pure
traditionality, is only the telos of a history of writing whose philosophy is
always to come. Whether this project of an infinite tradition is realized or
not, it must be acknowledged and respected in its sense as a project. That it
can always fail is the mark of its pure finitude and its pure historicity. If
the play of meaning can overflow signification (signalization), which is
always enveloped within the regional limits of nature, life and the soul,
this overflow is the moment of the attempt-to-write. The attempt-to-write
cannot be understood on the basis of voluntar

ism. The will to write is not an ulterior determination of a primal will.
On the contrary, the will to write reawakens the willful sense of the
will: freedom, break with the domain of empirical history, a break
whose aim is reconciliation with the hidden essence of the empirical,
with pure historicity. The will and the attempt to write are not the

14 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

desire to write, for it is a question here not of affectivity but of freedom and
duty. In its relationship to Being, the attempt-to-write poses itself as the
only way out of affectivity. A way out that can only be aimed at, and without
the certainty that deliverance is possible or that it is outside affectivity. To
be affected is to be finite: to write could still be to deceive finitude, and to
reach Being-a kind of Being which could neither be, nor affect me by
itself-from without existence. To write would be to attempt to forget
difference: to forget writing in the presence of so-called living and pure
speech."
In the extent to which the literary act proceeds from this attempt-towrite, it is indeed the acknowledgment of pure language, the responsibility confronting the vocation of "pure" speech which, once
understood, constitutes the writer as such. Heidegger says of pure
speech that it cannot "be conceived in the rigor of its essence" on the
basis of its "character-as-sign" (Zeichencharakter), "nor even perhaps of its
character-as-signification" (Bedeutungscharakter).36
Does not one thus run the risk of identifying the work with original
writing in general? Of dissolving the notion of art and the value of
"beauty" by which literature is currently distinguished from the letter in
general? But perhaps by removing the specificity of beauty from
aesthetic values, beauty is, on the contrary, liberated? Is there a
specificity of beauty, and would beauty gain from this effort?
Rousset believes so. And the structuralism proper to Jean Rousset is
defined, at least theoretically, against the temptation to overlook this
specificity (the temptation that would be Poulet's, for example, since he "has
little interest in art") ,37 putting Rousset close to Leo Spitzer and Marcel
Raymond in his scrupulousness about the formal autonomy of the workan "independent, absolute organism that is self-sufficient" (Forme et
Signification p. xx). "The work is a totality and always gains from being
experienced as such" (p. xxi). But here again, Rousset's position

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION 15
will call 'structures' these formal constants, these liaisons that betray a
mental universe reinvented by each artist according to his needs" (p. xii).
Structure is then the unity of a form and a meaning. It is true that in some
places the form of the work, or the form as the work, is treated as if it had
no origin, as if, again, in the masterpiece-and Rousset is interested only
in masterpieces-the wellbeing of the work was without history. Without
an intrinsic history. It is here that structuralism seems quite vulnerable,
and it is here that, by virtue of one whole aspect of his attempt-which is
far from covering it entirely-Rousset too runs the risk of conventional
Platonism. By keeping to the legitimate intention of protecting the internal
truth and meaning of the work from historicism, biographism or
psychologism (which, moreover, always lurk near the expression "mental
universe"), one risks losing any attentiveness to the internal historicity of
the work itself, in its relationship to a subjective origin that is not simply
psychological or mental. If one takes care to confine classical literary
history to its role as an "indispensable" "auxiliary," as "prologomenon
and restraint" (p. xii, n. 16), one risks overlooking another history, more
difficult to conceive: the history of the meaning of the work itself, of its
operation. This history of the work is not only its past, the eve or the
sleep in which it precedes itself in an author's intentions, but is also the
impossibility of its ever being present, of its ever being summarized by some
absolute simultaneity or instantaneousness. This is why, as we will verify,
there is no space of the work, if by space we mean presence and synopsis. And,
further on, we will see what the consequences of this can be for the tasks of
criticism. It seems, for the moment, that if "literary history" (even when its
techniques and its "philosophy" are renewed by "Marxism,"
"Freudianism," etc.) is only a restraint on the internal criticism of the
work, then the structuralist moment of this criticism has the counterpart
role of being the restraint on an internal geneti

depends upon a delicate balance. Always attentive to the unified foun-s
dations of dissociation, he circumvents the "objectivist" danger
denounced by Poulet by giving a definition of structure that is not
purely objective or formal; or circumvents the "objectivist" danger
denounced by Poulet by giving a definition of structure that is not
purely objective or formal; or circumvents it by at least not in principle
dissociating form from intention, or from the very act of the writer: "I

cism, in which value and meaning are reconstituted and reawakened in
their proper historicity and temporality. These latter can no longer be
objects without becoming absurdities, and the structure proper to them
must escape all classical categories.
Certainly, Rousset's avowed plan is to avoid this stasis of form, the
stasis of a form whose completion appears to liberate it from work,
from imagination and from the origin through which alone it can

16

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

continue to signify. Thus, when he distinguishes his task from that of
Jean-Pierre Richard,38 Rousset aims directly at this totality of thing and act,
form and intention, entelechy and becoming, the totality that is the literary
fact as a concrete form: "Is it possible to embrace simultaneously
imagination and morphology, to experience and to comprehend them in a
simultaneous act? This is what I would like to attempt, although well
persuaded that this undertaking, before being unitary, will often have to
make itself alternative [my italics]. But the end in sight is indeed the
simultaneous comprehension of a homogenous reality in a unifying
operation" (p. xxii).
But condemned or resigned to alternation, the critic, in acknowledging
it, is also liberated and acquitted by it. And it is here that Rousset's
difference is no longer deliberate. His personality, his style will affirm
themselves not through a methodological decision but through the play
of the critic's spontaneity within the freedom of the "alternative." This
spontaneity will, in fact, unbalance an alternation construed by Rousset as a
theoretical norm. A practiced inflection that also provides the style of
criticism-here Rousset's-with its structural form. This latter, Claude LeviStrauss remarks about social models and Rousset about structural motifs in
a literary work, "escapes creative will and clear consciousness" (p. xv).
What then is the imbalance of this preference? What is the preponderance
that is more actualized than acknowledged? It seems to be double.

There are lines which are monsters.... A line by itself has no
meaning; a second one is necessary to give expression to meaning.

On the one hand, structure becomes the object itself, the literary thing itself. It
is no longer what it almost universally was before: either a heuristic
instrument, a method of reading, a characteristic particularly revelatory of
content, or a system of objective relations, independent of

17

content and terminology; or, most often, both at once, for the fecundity
of structure did not exclude, but, on the contrary, rather implied that
relational configuration exists within the literary object. A structural
realism has always been practiced, more or less explicitly. But never
has structure been the exclusive term-in the double sense of the word-of
critical description. It was always a means or relationship for reading or
writing, for assembling signification, recognizing themes, ordering
constants and correspondences.
Here, structure, the framework of construction, morphological
correlation, becomes in fact and despite his theoretical intention the critic's
sole preoccupation. His sole or almost sole preoccupation. No longer a
method within the ordo cognescendi, no longer a relationship in the ordo
essendi, but the very being of the work. We are concerned with an
ultrastructuralism.
On the other hand (and consequently), structure as the literary thing is this
time taken, or at least practiced, literally. Now, stricto sensu, the notion
of structure refers only to space, geometric or morphological space, the
order of forms and sites. Structure is first the structure of an organic or
artificial work, the internal unity of an assemblage, a construction; a work is
governed by a unifying principle, the architecture that is built and made visible
in a location. "Superbes monuments de l'orgueil
des humains, / Pyramides, tombeaux, dont la noble structure / a
temoigne que Fart, par 1'adresse des mains / Et l'assidu travail pent
vaincre la nature" ("Splendid monuments of human pride, pyramids,
tombs, whose noble structure Bears witness that art, through the skill of
hands and hard work, can vanquish nature"-Scarron). Only metaphorically was this topographical literality displaced in the direction of its
Aristotelean and topical signification (the theory of commonplaces in
language and the manipulation of motifs or arguments.) In the seventeenth century they spoke of "the choice and arrangement of words,
the structure and harmony of the composition, the modest
grandeur of the thoughts."39 Or further: "In bad structure there is always
something to be added, or diminished, or changed, not simply as
concerns the topic, but also the words.""
How is this history of metaphor possible? Does the fact that language
can determine things only by spatializing them suffice to explain that, in
return, language must spatialize itself as soon as it designates and

reflects upon itself? This question can be asked in general about all
language and all metaphors. But here it takes on a particular urgency.
Hence, for as long as the metaphorical sense of the notion of structure
is not acknowledged as such, that is to say interrogated and even
destroyed as concerns its figurative quality so that the nonspatiality or
original spatiality designated by it may be revived, one runs the risk,
through a kind of sliding as unnoticed as it is efficacious, of confusing meaning
with its geometric, morphological, or, in the best of cases, cinematic
model. One risks being interested in the figure itself to the detriment of
the play going on within it metaphorically. (Here, we are taking the word
"figure" in its geometric as well as rhetorical sense. In Rousset's style,
figures of rhetoric are always the figures of a geometry distinguished by its
suppleness.)
Now, despite his stated propositions, and although he calls structure the
union of formal structure and intention, Rousset, in his analyses, grants
an absolute privilege to spatial models, mathematical functions, lines, and
forms. Many examples could be cited in which the essence of his
descriptions is reduced to this. Doubtless, he acknowledges the
interdependency of space and time (Forme et Signification, p. xiv). But, in fact,
time itself is always reduced. To a dimension in the best of cases. It is only the
element in which a form or a curve can be displayed. It is always in
league with a line or design, always extended in space, level. It calls for
measurement. Now, even if one does not follow Claude LeviStrauss when he
asserts that there "is no necessary connection between measure and
structure,"' one must acknowledge that for certain kinds of structuresthose of literary ideality in particular-this connection is excluded in
principle.
The geometric or morphological elements of Forme et Signification are
corrected only by a kind of mechanism, never by energetics. Mutatis
mutandis, one might be tempted to make the same reproach to
Rousset, and through him to the best literary formalism, as Leibniz
made to Descartes: that of having explained everything in nature with
figures and movements, and of ignoring force by confusing it with the
quantity of movement. Now, in the sphere of language and writing, which,
more than the body, "corresponds to the soul," "the ideas of size,
figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and ... stand for
something imaginary relative to our perceptions.""

This geometry is only metaphorical, it will be said. Certainly. But
metaphor is never innocent. It orients research and fixes results. When the
spatial model is hit upon, when it functions, critical reflection rests within
it. In fact, and even if criticism does not admit this to be so.
One example among many others.
At the beginning of the essay entitled "Polyeucte, or the Ring and the Helix,"
the author prudently warns us that if he insists upon "schemas that might
appear excessively geometrical, it is because Corneille, more than any other,
practiced symmetry." Moreover, "this geometry is not cultivated for
itself," for "in the great plays it is a means subordinated to the ends of
passion" (p. 7).
But what, in fact, does this essay yield? Only the geometry of a
theater which is, however, one of "mad passion, heroic enthusiasm" (p.
7). Not only does the geometric structure of Polyeucte mobilize all the
resources and attention of the author, but an entire teleology of
Corneille's progress is coordinated to it. Everything transpires as if, until
1643, Corneille had only gotten a glimpse of, or anticipated the design
of, Polyeucte, which was still in the shadows and which would eventually
coincide with the Corneillean design itself, thereby taking on the dignity
of an entelechy toward which everything would be in motion.
Corneille's work and development are put into perspective and interpreted
teleologically on the basis of what is considered its destination, its final
structure. Before Polyeucte, everything is but a sketch in which only what is
missing is due consideration, those elements which are still shapeless and
lacking as concerns the perfection to come, or which only foretell this
perfection. "There were several years between La galerie du palais and
Polyeucte. Corneille looks for and finds himself I will not here trace the details of
his progress, in which Le Cid and Cinna show him inventing his own structure"
(p. 9). After Polyeucte? It is never mentioned. Similarly, among the works prior
to it, only La galerie du palais and Le Cid are taken into account, and these
plays are examined, in the style
of preformationism, only as structural prefigurations of Polyeucte.
Thus, in La galerie du patois the inconstancy of Celidee separates her
from her lover. Tired of her inconstancy (but why?), she draws near him
again, while he, in turn, feigns inconstancy. They thus separate, to be
united at the end of the play, which is outlined as follows: "Initial
accord, separation, median reunification that fails, second separation

20 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

symmetrical to the first, final conjunction. The destination is a return to
the point of departure after a circuit in the form of a crossed ring" (p.
8). What is singular is the crossed ring, for the destination as return
to the point of departure is of the commonest devices. Proust himself ...
(cf. p. 144).
The framework is analogous in Le Cid: "The ring-like movement with a
median crossing is maintained" (p. 9). But here a new signification
intervenes, one that panorography immediately transcribes in a new
dimension. In effect, "at each step along the way, the lovers develop and
grow, not only each one for himself, but through the other and for the other,
according to a very Corneillean [my italic] law of progressively discovered
interdependence; their union is made stronger and deeper by the very
ruptures that should have destroyed it. Here, the phases of distanciation are
no longer phases of separation and inconstancy, but tests of fidelity" (p. 9).
The difference between La galerie du pubis and Le Cid, one could be led to
believe, is no longer in the design and movement of presences (distanceproximity), but in the quality and inner intensity of the experiences (tests
of fidelity, manner of being for the

other, force of rupture, etc.). And it could be thought that by virtue of
the very enrichment of the play, the structural metaphor will now be
incapable of grasping the play's quality and intensity, and that the work of
forces will no longer be translated into a difference of form.
In believing so one would underestimate the resources of the critic. The
dimension of height will now complete the analogical equipment. What is
gained in the tension of sentiments (quality of fidelity, way of
being-for-the-other, etc.) is gained in terms of elevation; for values, as we
know, mount scalewise, and the Good is most high. The union of the
lovers is deepened by an "aspiration toward the highest" (p. 9). Altus:
the deep is the high. The ring, which remains, has become an "ascend
ing spiral" and "helical ascent." And the horizontal flatness of La galerie
was only an appearance still hiding the essential: the ascending move
ment. Le Cid only begins to reveal it: "Also the destination (in Le Cid),
even if it apparently leads back to the initial conjunction, is not at all a
return to the point of departure; the situation has changed, for the
characters have been elevated. This is the essential [my italics]: the Cornell
lean movement is a movement of violent elevation..................(but where has this
violence and the force of movement, which is more than its quantity or

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

direction, been spoken of?) ". . . of aspiration toward the highest; joined
to the crossing of two rings, it now traces an ascending spiral, helical
ascent. This formal combination will receive all the richness of its
signification in Polyeucte" (p. 9). The structure thus was a receptive one,
waiting, like a girl in love, ready for its future meaning to marry and
fecundate it.
We would be convinced if beauty, which is value and force, were
subject to regulation and schematization. Must it be shown once more that
this is without sense? Thus, if Le Cid is beautiful, it is so by virtue of that
within it which surpasses schemes and understanding. Thus, one does not
speak of Le Cid itself, if it is beautiful, in terms of rings, spirals, and helices.
If the movement of these lines is not Le Cid, neither will it become Polyeucte
as it perfects itself still further. It is not the truth of Le Cid or of Polyeucte. Nor is it
the psychological truth of passion, faith, duty, etc., but, it will be said, it is
this truth according to Corneille; not according to Pierre Corneille,
whose biography and psychology do not interest us here: the "movement
toward the highest," the greatest specificity of the schema, is none other than
the Corneillean movement (p. 1). The progress indicated by Le Cid, which also
aspires to the heights of Polyeucte is a "progress in the Corneillean meaning"
(ibid.). It would be helpful here to reproduce the analysis of Polyeucte,43 in
which the schema reaches its greatest perfection and greatest internal
complication; and does so with a mastery such that one wonders whether
the credit is due Corneille or Rousset. We said above that the latter was too
Cartesian and not Leibnizian enough. Let us be more precise. He is also
Leibnizian: he seems to think that, confronted with a literary work, one
should always be able to find a line, no matter how complex, that
accounts for the unity, the totality of its movement, and all the points it
must traverse.
In the Discourse on Metaphysics, Leibniz writes, in effect: "Because, let us suppose
for example that someone jots down a quantity of points upon a sheet of
paper helter skelter, as do those who exercise the ridiculous art of
Geomancy; now I say that it is possible to find a geometrical line whose
concept shall be uniform and constant, that is, in accordance with a
certain formula, and which line at the same time shall pass through all
of those points, and in the same order in which the hand jotted them
down; also if a continuous line be traced, which is now

21

22

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

straight, now circular, and now of any other description, it is possible to
find a mental equivalent, a formula or an equation common to all the
points of this line by virtue of which formula the changes in the
direction of the line must occur. There is no instance of a fact whose
contour does not form part of a geometric line and which can not be
traced entire by a certain mathematical motion."44
But Leibniz was speaking of divine creation and intelligence: "I use
these comparisons to picture a certain imperfect resemblance to the
divine wisdom.... I do not pretend at all to explain thus the great
mystery upon which depends the whole universe."45 As concerns qualities,
forces and values, and also as concerns nondivine works read by finite
minds, this confidence in mathematical-spatial representation seems to be (on
the scale of an entire civilization, for we are no longer dealing with the
question of Rousset's language, but with the totality of our language
and its credence) analogous to the confidence placed by Canaque
artists46 in the level representation of depth. A confidence that the
structural ethnographer analyzes, moreover, with more prudence and
less abandon than formerly.
Our intention here is not, through the simple motions of balancing,
equilibration or overturning, to oppose duration to space, quality to
quantity, force to form, the depth of meaning or value to the surface of
figures. Quite to the contrary. To counter this simple alternative, to counter
the simple choice of one of the terms or one of the series against the
other, we maintain that it is necessary to seek new concepts and new
models, an economy escaping this system of metaphysical oppositions. This
economy would not be an energetics of pure, shapeless force. The
differences examined simultaneously would be differences of site" and
differences of force. If we appear to oppose one series to the

other, it is because from within the classical system we wish to make
apparent the noncritical privilege naively granted to the other series by a
certain structuralism. Our discourse irreducibly belongs to the system
of metaphysical oppositions. The break with this structure of belonging can
be announced only through a certain organization, a certain strategic
arrangement which, within the field of metaphysical opposition, uses the
strengths of the field to turn its own stratagems against it, producing a force
of dislocation that spreads itself throughout the entire system, fissuring
it in every direction and thoroughly delimiting it."

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

Assuming that, in order to avoid "abstractionism," one fixes uponas
Rousset does at least theoretically-the union of form and meaning, one
then would have to say that the aspiration toward the highest, in the
"final leap which will unite them ... in God," etc., the passionate,
qualitative, intensive, etc., aspiration, finds its form in the spiraling
movement. But to say further that this union-which, moreover authorizes
every metaphor of elevation-is difference itself, Corneille's own idiomis this to
say much? And if this were the essential aspect of "Corneillean movement,"
where would Corneille be? Why is there more beauty in Polyeucte than
in "an ascending movement of two rings"? The force of the work, the force
of genius, the force, too, of that which engenders in general is precisely that
which resists geometrical metaphorization and is the proper object of
literary criticism. In another sense than Poulet's, Rousset sometimes seems
to have "little interest in art."
Unless Rousset considers every line, every spatial form (but every
form is spatial) beautiful a priori, unless he deems, as did a certain
medieval theology (Considerans in particular), that form is transcendentally beautiful, since it is and makes things be, and that Being is
Beautiful; these were truths for this theology to the extent that monsters
themselves, as it was said, were beautiful, in that they exist through
line or form, which bear witness to the order of the created universe and
reflect divine light. Formosus means beautiful.
Will Buffon not say too, in his Supplement to Natural History (vol. XI, p.
417): "Most monsters are such with symmetry, the disarray of the parts
seeming to have been arranged in orderly fashion?"

Now, Rousset does not seem to posit, in his theoretical Introduction, that
every form is beautiful, but only the form that is aligned with
meaning, the form that can be understood because it is, above all, in
league with meaning. Why then, once more, this geometer's privilege?
Assuming, in the last analysis, that beauty lets itself be espoused or
exhausted by the geometer, is he not, in the case of the sublime-and
Corneille is said to be sublime-forced to commit an act of violence?

Further, for the sake of determining an essential "Corneillean
movement," does one not lose what counts? Everything that defies a
geometrical-mechanical framework-and not only the pieces which
cannot be constrained by curves and helices, not only force and quality,
which are meaning itself, but also duration, that which is pure qualitative

23

24

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

heterogeneity within movement-is reduced to the appearance of the
inessential for the sake of this essentialism or teleological structuralism.
Rousset understands theatrical or novelistic movement as Aristotle
understood movement in general: transition to the act, which itself is the
repose of the desired form. Everything transpires as if everything within
the dynamics of Corneillean meaning, and within each of Corneille's
plays, came to life with the aim of final peace, the peace
of the structural energeia: Polyeucte. Outside this peace, before and after it,
movement, in its pure duration, in the labor of its organization, can
itself' be only sketch or debris. Or even debauch, a fault or sin as
compared to Polyeucte, the "first impeccable success." Under the word
"impeccable," Rousset notes: "Cinna still sins in this respect" (p. 12).
Preformationism, teleologism, reduction of force, value and durationthese are as one with geometrism, creating structure. This is the actual
structure which governs, to one degree or another, all the essays in this
book. Everything which, in the first Marivaux, does not announce the
schema of the "double register" (narration and look at the narration) is
"a series of youthful novelistic exercises" by which "he prepares not
only the novels of maturity, but also his dramatic works" (p. 47). "The
true Marivaux is still almost absent from it" [my italics]. "From our
perspective, there is only one fact to retain ..."
(ibid.). There follows an analysis and a citation upon which is concluded: "This outline of a dialogue above the heads of the characters,
through a broken-off narration in which the presence and the absence
of the author alternate, is the outline of the veritable Marivaux....
Thus is sketched, in a first and rudimentary form, the properly
Marivauldian combination of spectacle and spectator, perceived and

perceiver. We will see it perfect itself" (p. 48).
The difficulties accumulate, as do our reservations, when Rousset
specifies that this "permanent structure of Marivaux's," +9 although
invisible or latent in the works of his youth, "belongs," as the "willful
dissolution of novelistic illusion," to the "burlesque tradition" (p. 50;
cf. also p. 60). Marivaux's originality, which "retains" from this trad
shows the work of the author and the author's reflection on his work,
is then "critical consciousness" (p. 51). Marivaux's idiom is not to be
found in the structure described but in the intention that animates a

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

25

traditional form and creates a new structure. The truth of the general
structure thus restored does not describe the Marivauldian organism along its
own lines. And less so its force.
Yet: "The structural fact thus described-the double register-appears as a
constant.... At the same time [my italics] it corresponds to the
knowledge that Marivauldian man has of himself: a 'heart' without
vision, caught in the field of a consciousness which itself is only
vision" (p. 64). But how can a "structural fact," traditional during this era
(assuming that as it is defined, it is determined and original enough to
belong to an era) "correspond" to the consciousness of "Marivauldian
man"? Does the structure correspond to Marivaux's most singular
intention? Is Marivaux not, rather, a good example-and it would have to be
demonstrated why he is a good example-of a literary structure of the times
and, through it, an example of a structure of the era itself? Are there not
here a thousand unresolved methodological problems that are the
prerequisites for a single structural study, a monograph on an author or a
work?
If geometrism is especially apparent in the essays on Corneille and Marivaux,
preformationism triumphs a propos of Proust and Claudel. And this time in
a form that is more organicist than topographical. It is here too, that
preformationism is most fruitful and convincing. First, because it permits
the mastering of a richer subject matter, penetrated more from within.
(May we be permitted to remark that we feel that what is best about this
book is not due to its method, but to the quality of the attention given to its
objects?) Further, because Proust's and Claudel's aesthetics are profoundly
aligned with Rousset's.

For Proust himself and the demonstration given leaves no doubt on this
subject, if one still had any-the demands of structure were constant and
conscious, manifesting themselves through marvels of (neither true nor
false) symmetry, recurrence, circularity, light thrown backward,
superimposition (without adequation) of the first and the last, etc.
Teleology here is not a product of the critic's projection, but is the author's
own theme. The implication of the end in the beginning, the strange
relationships between the subject who writes the book and the subject of
this book, between the consciousness of the narrator and that of the heroall this recalls the style of becoming and the dialectic
of the "we" in the Phenomenology of the Mind." We are indeed concerned

with the phenomenology of a mind here: "One can discern still more
reasons for the importance attached by Proust to this circular form of a novel
whose end returns to its beginning. In the final pages one sees the hero and
the narrator unite too, after a long march during which each sought after
the other, sometimes very close to each other, sometimes very far apart;
they coincide at the moment of resolution, which is the instant when the
hero becomes the narrator, that is, the author of his own history. The
narrator is the hero revealed to himself, is the person that the hero,
throughout his history, desires to be but never can be; he now takes the
place of this hero and will be able to set himself to the task of edifying
the work which has ended, and first to the task of writing Combray,
which is the origin of the narrator as well as of the hero. The end of the
book makes its existence possible and comprehensible. The novel is
conceived such that its end engenders its beginning" (p. 144). Proust's
aesthetics and critical method are, ultimately, not outside his work but
are the very heart of his creation: "Proust will make this aesthetic into
the real subject of his work" (p. 135). As in Hegel, the philosophical,
critical, reflective consciousness is not only contained in the scrutiny
given to the operations and works of history. What is first in question is
the history of this consciousness itself. It would not be deceptive to say that
this aesthetic, as a concept of the work in general, exactly overlaps
Rousset's. And this aesthetic is indeed, if I may say so, a practiced
preformationism: "The last chapter of the last volume," Proust notes, "was
written immediately
after the first chapter of the first volume. Everything in between was
written afterward."
By preformationism we indeed mean preformationism: the wellknown biological doctrine, opposed to epigenesis, according to which the
totality of hereditary characteristics is enveloped in the germ, and is already
in action in reduced dimensions that nevertheless respect the forms and
proportions of the future adult. A theory of encasement was at the center of
preformationism which today makes us smile. But what are we smiling
at? At the adult in miniature, doubtless, but also at the attributing of
something more than finality to natural life-providence in action and art
conscious of its works. But when one is concerned with an art that does
not imitate nature, when the artist is a man, and when it is consciousness
that engenders, preformationism no longer

makes us smile. Logos spermatikos is in its proper element, is no longer an export,
for it is an anthropomorphic concept. For example: after having brought to
light the necessity of repetition in Proustian composition, Rousset writes:
"Whatever one thinks of the device which introduces Un amour de Swann,
it is quickly forgotten, so tight and organic is the liaison that connects the part
to the whole. Once one has finished reading the Recherche, one perceives
that the episode is not at all isolable; without it, the ensemble would be
unintelligible. Un amour de Swann is a novel within a novel, a painting
within a painting. .., it brings to mind, not the stories within stories that
so many seventeenth- or eighteenthcentury novelists encase in their
narratives, but rather the inner stories that can be read the Vie de Marianne,
in Balzac or Gide. At one of the entryways to his novel, Proust places a
small convex mirror which reflects the novel in abbreviated form" (p.
146). The metaphor and operation of encasement impose themselves,
even if they are finally replaced by a finer, more adequate image which,
at bottom, signifies the same relationship of implication. A reflecting and
representative kind of implication, this time.
It is for these same reasons that Rousset's aesthetic is aligned with
Claudel's. Moreover, Proust's aesthetic is defined at the beginning of the
essay on Claudel. And the affinities are evident, above and beyond all the
differences. These affinities are assembled in the theme of "structural
monotony": "'And thinking once more about the monotony of Vinteuil's
works, I explained to Albertine that great writers have created only a
single work, or rather have refracted the same beauty that they bring
to the world through diverse elements' " (p. 171). Claudel: "'Le soulier de
satin is The d'or in another form. It summarizes both The d'or and Portage
de midi. It is even the conclusion of Partage de midi ... ' " "'A poet does hardly
anything but develop a preestablished plan'" (p. 172).
This aesthetic which neutralizes duration and force as the difference
between the acorn and the oak, is not autonomously Proust's or
Claudel's. It translates a metaphysics. Proust also calls "time in its pure
state" the "atemporal" or the "eternal." The truth of time is not temporal. Analogously (analogously only), time as irreversible succession, is,
according to Claudel, only the phenomenon, the epidermis, the surface
image of the essential truth of the universe as it is conceived

and created by God. This truth is absolute simultaneity. Like God, Claudel, the
creator and composer, "has a taste for things that exist together" (Art
poetique). u
This metaphysical intention, in the last resort, validates, through a series
of mediations, the entire essay on Proust and all the analyses devoted to
the "fundamental scene of Claudel's theater" (p. 183), the "pure state of
the Claudelian structure" (p. 177) found in Portage de midi, and to the
totality of this theater in which, as Claudel himself says, "time is
manipulated like an accordion, for our pleasure" such that "hours last
and days are passed over" (p. 181).
We will not, of course, examine in and of themselves this metaphysics or
theology of temporality. That the aesthetics they govern can be
legitimately and fruitfully applied to the reading of Proust or Claudel is
evident, for these are their aesthetics, daughter (or mother) of their
metaphysics. It is also readily demonstrable that what is in question is the
metaphysics implicit in all structuralism, or in every structuralist
proposition. In particular, a structuralist reading, by its own activity, always
presupposes and appeals to the theological simultaneity of the book, and
considers itself deprived of the essential when this simultaneity is not
accessible. Rousset: "In any event, reading, which is developed in
duration, will have to make the work simultaneously present in all its
parts in order to be global.... Similar to a 'painting in movement,' the book
is revealed only in successive fragments. The task of the demanding reader
consists in overturning this natural tendency of the book, so that it may
present itself in its entirety to the mind's scrutiny. The only complete
reading is the one which transforms the book into a simultaneous network
of reciprocal relationships: it is then that surprises emerge" (p. xiii).
(What surprises? How can simultaneity hold surprises in store? Rather,
it neutralizes the surprises of nonsimultaneity. Surprises emerge from
the dialogue between the simultaneous and the nonsimultaneous.
Which suffices to say that structural simultaneity itself serves to reassure.)
Jean-Pierre Richard: "The difficulty of every structural account resides in
that it must desc ~'be sequentially, successively, that which in fact exists all at
once,
simultaneously" (L'univers imaginaire de Mallarme, p. 28). Thus, Rousset
invokes the difficulty of gaining access to the simultaneity which is
truth within reading, and Richard the difficulty of accounting for it

within writing. In both cases, simultaneity is the myth of a total reading or
description, promoted to the status of a regulatory ideal. The search for
the simultaneous explains the capacity to be fascinated by the spatial
image: is space not "the order of coexistences" (Leibniz)? But by saying
"simultaneity" instead of space, one attempts to concentrate time instead of
forgetting it. "Duration thus takes on the illusory form of a homogeneous
milieu, and the union between these two terms, space and duration, is
simultaneity, which could be defined as the intersection of time with
space."52 In this demand for the flat and the horizontal, what is intolerable
for structuralism is indeed the richness implied by the volume, every
element of signification that cannot be spread out into the simultaneity of
a form. But is it by chance that the book is, first and foremost, volume?53
And that the meaning of meaning (in the general sense of meaning and
not in the sense of signalization) is infinite implication, the indefinite
referral of signifier to signifier? And that its force is a certain pure and
infinite equivocality which gives signified meaning no respite, no rest,
but engages it in its own economy so that it always signifies again and
differs? Except in the Livre irrealise by Mallarme, that which is written is
never identical to itself.
Unrealized: this does not mean that Mallarme did not succeed in
realizing a Book which would be at one with itself-he simply did not
want to. He unrealized the unity of the Book by making the categories in
which it was supposed to be securely conceptualized tremble: while
speaking of an "identification with itself' of the Book, he underlines
that the Book is at once "the same and other," as it is "made up of
itself." It lends itself not only to a "double interpretation," but through it,
says Mallarme, "I sow, so to speak, this entire double volume here and
there ten times." 54
Does one have the right to constitute this metaphysics or aesthetics so
well adapted to Proust and Claudel as the general method of structuralism?55 This, however, is precisely what Rousset does, in the extent to
which, as we have at least tried to demonstrate, he decides that
everything not intelligible in the light of a "preestablished" teleological
framework, and not visible in its simultaneity, is reducible to the
inconsequentiality of accident or dross. Even in the essays devoted to
Proust and Claudel, the essays guided by the most comprehensive
structure, Rousset must decide to consider as "genetic accidents" "each

30

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

episode, each character" whose "eventual independence" from the
"central theme" or "general organization of the work" is noticeable
(p. 164); lie must accept the confrontation of the "true Proust" with
the "Novelist" to whom, moreover, he can sometimes "do wrong," just
as the true Proust, according to Rousset, is also capable of missing
the "truth" of love, etc. (p. 166). In the same way that "the true
Baudelaire is perhaps only in the Baleen, and all of Flaubert is in Madame
Bovary" (p. xix), the true Proust is not simultaneously everywhere.
Rousset must also conclude that the characters of J'Otage are severed not by
"circumstance," but, "to express it better," by the "demands of the
Claudelian framework" (p. 179); he must deploy marvels of subtlety to
demonstrate that in Le soulier de satin Claudel does not "repudiate
himself' and does not "renounce" his "constant framework" (p. 183).
What is most serious is that this "ultrastructuralist" method, as we have
called it, seems to contradict, in certain respects, the most precious and
original intention of structuralism. In the biological and linguistic fields
where it first appeared, structuralism above all insists upon preserving the
coherence and completion of each totality at its own level. In a given
configuration, it first prohibits the consideration of that which is
incomplete or missing, everything that would make the configuration
appear to be a blind anticipation of, or mysterious deviation from, an
orthogenesis whose own conceptual basis would have to be a telos or an
ideal norm. To be a structuralist is first to concentrate on the
organization of meaning, on the autonomy and idiosyncratic balance,
the completion of each moment, each form; and it is to refuse to relegate
everything that is not comprehensible as an ideal type to the status of
aberrational accident. The pathological itself
is not the simple absence of structure. It is organized. It cannot be
understood as the deficiency, defect, or decomposition of a beautiful,
ideal totality. It is not the simple undoing of telos.
It is true that the rejection of finalism is a rule, a methodological
norm, that structuralism can apply only with difficulty. The rejection of
finalism is a vow of infidelity to telos which the actual effort can never adhere
to. Structuralism lives within and on the difference between its promise and
its practice. Whether biology, linguistics, or literature is in
question, how can an organized totality be perceived without reference to
its end, or without presuming to know its end, at least? And if

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

31

meaning is meaningful only within a totality, could it come forth if the
totality were not animated by the anticipation of an end, or by an
intentionality which, moreover, does not necessarily and primarily
belong to a consciousness? If there are structures, they are possible only
on the basis of the fundamental structure which permits totality to open
and overflow itself such that it takes on meaning by anticipating a telos which here
must be understood in its most indeterminate form. This opening is
certainly that which liberates time and genesis (even coincides with
them), but it is also that which risks enclosing progression toward the
future-becoming-by giving it form. That which risks stifling force
under form.
It may be acknowledged, then, that in the rereading to which we are
invited by Rousset, light is menaced from within by that which also
metaphysically menaces every structuralism: the possibility of concealing
meaning through the very act of uncovering it. To comprehend the structure of a
becoming, the form of a force, is to lose meaning by finding it. The
meaning of becoming and of force, by virtue of their pure, intrinsic
characteristics, is the repose of the beginning and the end, the
peacefulness of a spectacle, horizon or face." Within this peace and
repose the character of becoming and of force is disturbed by meaning
itself. The meaning of meaning is Apollonian by virtue of everything
within it that can be seen."
To say that force is the origin of the phenomenon is to say nothing. By
its very articulation force becomes a phenomenon. Hegel demonstrated
convincingly that the explication of a phenomenon by a force is a
tautology.58 But in saying this, one must refer to language's peculiar
inability to emerge from itself in order to articulate its origin, and not
to the thought of force. Force is the other of language without which
language would not be what it is.
In order to respect this strange movement within language, in order not
to reduce it in turn, we would have to attempt a return to the
metaphor of darkness and light (of self-revelation and selfconcealment), the founding metaphor of Western philosophy as metaphysics. The founding metaphor not only because it is a photological oneand in this respect the entire history of our philosophy is a photology, the
name given to a history of, or treatise on, light-but because it is a metaphor.
Metaphor in general, the passage from one existent to

which we spoke at the outset. Are we mistaken in perceiving it beneath the
praise of structural and Claudelian "monotony" which closes Forme et
Signification?
We should conclude, but the debate is interminable. The divergence, the
difference between Dionysus and Apollo, between ardor and structure, cannot
be erased in history, for it is not in history. It too, in an unexpected
sense, is an original structure: the opening of history, historicity itself
Difference does not simply belong either to history or to structure. If we
must say, along with Schelling, that "all is but Dionysus," we must
know-and this is to write-that, like pure force, Dionysus is worked by
difference. He sees and lets himself be seen. And tears out (his) eyes. For
all eternity, he has had a relationship to his exterior, to visible form, to
structure, as he does to his death. This
is how he appears (to himself).
"Not enough forms ...," said Flaubert. How is he to be understood?

Does he wish to celebrate the other of form? the "too many things
which exceed and resist form? In praise of Dionysus? One is certain that
this is not so. Flaubert, on the contrary, is sighing, "Alas! not enough
forms." A religion of the work as form. Moreover, the things for which
we do not have enough forms are already phantoms of energy,
"ideas" "larger than the plasticity of style." In question is a point against
Leconte de Lisle, an affectionate point, for Flaubert "likes
that fellow a lot."62
Nietzsche was not fooled: "Flaubert, a new edition of Pascal, but as an
artist with this instinctive belief at heart: 'Flaubert est toujours
haissable, l'homme nest rien, 1'oeuvre est tout.' ^63
We would have to choose then, between writing and dance.
Nietzsche recommends a dance of the pen in vain: " . . . dancing
with the feet, with ideas, with words, and need I add that one must also
be able to dance with the pen-that one must learn how to write?"".''
Flaubert was aware, and he was right, that writing cannot be thor
oughly Dionysiac. "One can only think and write sitting down," he
said. Joyous anger of Nietzsche: "Here I have got you, you nihilist! A
sedentary life is the real sin against the Holy Spirit. Only those thoughts
that come when you are walking have any value. "'S
But Nietzsche was certain that the writer would never be upright;

FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

35

that writing is first and always something over which one bends. Better still
when letters are no longer figures of fire in the heavens.
Nietzsche was certain, but Zarathustra was positive: "Here do I sit and
wait, old broken tables around me and also new half tables. When cometh
mine hour?-The hour of my descent, of my down-going. "66 "Die
Stunde meines Niederganges, Unterganges." It will be necessary to
descend, to work, to bend in order to engrave and carry the new Tables
to the valleys, in order to read them and have them read. Writing is the
outlet as the descent of meaning outside itself within itself: metaphorfor-others-aimed-at-others-here-and-now, metaphor as the possibility of
others here-and-now, metaphor as metaphysics in which Being must hide
itself if the other is to appear. Excavation within the other toward the
other in which the same seeks its vein and the true gold of its
phenomenon. SubII4sion in which the same can always

lose (itself). Niedergang, Untergang. But the same is nothing, is not (it)self
before taking the risk of losing (itself). For the fraternal other is not first in
the peace of what is called intersubjectivity, but in the work and the peril
of inter-rogation; the other is not certain within the peace of the response
in which two affirmations espouse each other, but is called up in the night by the
excavating work of interrogation. Writing is the moment of this
original Valley of the other within Being. The moment of depth as decay.

accused; as a disciple, he is challenged by the master who speaks within

reject it in advance, having elaborated it before him; and having interiorized
the master, he is also challenged by the disciple that he himself is. This
interminable unhappiness of the disciple perhaps stems from the fact that

consciousness of an admiring and grateful disciple. Now, the disciple's

and silent dialogue which made him into a disciple-this disciple's
consciousness is an unhappy consciousness. Starting to enter into
dialogue in the world, that is, starting to answer back, he always feels

38

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

I here call interpretation is a certain passage, a certain semantic relationship
proposed by Foucault between, on the one hand, what Descartes said-or what
lie is believed to have said or meant-and on the other hand, let us say, with
intentional vagueness for the moment, a certain "historical structure," as it
is called, a certain meaningful historical totality, a total historical project
through which we think what Descartes said-or what he is believed to
have said or meant-can particularly be demonstrated. In asking if the
interpretation is justifiable, I am therefore asking about two things,
putting two preliminary questions into one: (a) Have we fully understood
the sign itself, in itself? In other words, has what Descartes said and
meant been clearly perceived? This comprehension of the sign in and of
itself, in its immediate materiality as a sign, if I may so call it, is only the
first moment but also the indispensable condition of all hermeneutics and
of any claim to transition from the sign to the signified. When one
attempts, in a general way, to pass from an obvious to a latent language, one
must first be rigorously sure of the obvious meaning.' The analyst, for
example, must first speak the

tion: once understood as a sign, does Descartes's stated intention have
tionship assigned to it? Does it have the historical meaning assigned to it? "Does
it have the historical meaning assigned to it?" That is, again, two ques
tions in one: Does it have the historical meaning assigned to it? does it,
have this meaning, a given meaning Foucault assigns to it? Or, second,:'

history not of psychiatry," Foucault says, "but of madness itself, in its
most vibrant state, before being captured by knowledge."
It is a question, therefore, of escaping the trap or objectivist naivete that
would consist in writing a history of untamed madness, of madness as it
carries itself and breathes before being caught and paralyzed in the nets of
classical reason, from within the very language of classical reason itself,
utilizing the concepts that were the historical instruments of the capture
of madness-the restrained and restraining language of reason. Foucault's
determination to avoid this trap is constant. It is the most audacious and
seductive aspect of his venture, producing its admirable tension. But it is
also, with all seriousness, the maddest aspect of his project. And it is
remarkable that this obstinate determination to avoid the trap-that is, the trap
set by classical reason to catch madness and which can now catch Foucault
as he attempts to write a history of madness itself without repeating the
aggression of rationalism-this determination to bypass reason is
expressed in two

ways difficult to reconcile at first glance. Which is to say that it is
expressed uneasily.
Sometimes Foucault globally rejects the language of reason, which
itself is the language of order (that is to say, simultaneously the language
of the system of objectivity, of the universal rationality of which psychiatry
wishes to be the expression, and the language of the body, politic-the
right to citizenship in the philosopher's city overlapping here with the
right to citizenship anywhere, the philosophical realm functioning,
within the unity of a certain structure, as the metaphor or
the metaphysics of the political realm). At these moments he writes
sentences of this type (he has just evoked the broken dialogue between
reason and madness at the end of the eighteenth century, a break tha
was finalized by the annexation of the totality of language-and of the
right to language-by psychiatric reason as the delegate of societal and
psychiatry, which is a monologue of reason on madness, could be
established only on the basis of such a silence. I have not tried to write
the history of that language but, rather, the archaeology of tha
silence."5 And throughout the book runs the theme linking madness t
silence, to "words without language" or "without the voice of a sub
ject," "obstinate murmur of a language that speaks by itself, witho

COG ITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS

41

speaker or interlocutor, piled up upon itself, strangulated, collapsing
before reaching the stage of formulation, quietly returning to the
silence front which it never departed. The calcinated root of meaning."
The history of madness itself is therefore the archaeology of a silence.
But, first of all, is there a history of silence? Further, is not an archae
ology, even of silence, a logic, that is, an organized language, a project,
an order, a sentence, a syntax, a work? 6 Would not the archaeology of
silence be the most efficacious and subtle restoration, the repetition, in
the most irreducibly ambiguous meaning of the word, of the act per
petrated against madness-and be so at the very moment when this act
is denounced? Without taking into account that all the signs which
allegedly serve as indices of the origin of this silence and of this stifled
speech, and as indices of everything that has made madness an interrupted and forbidden, that is, arrested, discourse-all these signs and
documents are borrowed, without exception, from the juridical province
of interdiction.
Hence, one can inquire-as Foucault does also, at moments other
than those when he contrives to speak of silence (although in too
lateral and implicit a fashion from my point of view)-about the source and
the status of the language of this archaeology, of this language which is
to be understood by a reason that is not classical reason. What is the
historical responsibility of this logic of archaeology? Where should it be
situated? Does it suffice to stack the tools of psychiatry neatly, inside a
tightly shut workshop, in order to return to innocence
and to end all complicity with the rational or political order which keeps
madness captive? The psychiatrist is but the delegate of this order, one
delegate among others. Perhaps it does not suffice to imprison or to
exile the delegate, or to stifle him; and perhaps it does not suffice to deny
oneself the conceptual material of psychiatry in order to exculpate one's
own language. All our European languages, the language of everything that
has participated, from near or far, in the adventure of Western reason-all this
is the immense delegation of the
project defined by Foucault under the rubric of the capture or objectifi
cation of madness. Nothing within this language, and no one among those
o spea it can es
th hiill
,
capeestorca guit-if there is one, and if it is
'storical in a classical sense-which Foucault apparently wishes to put a
trial. But such a trial may be impossible, for by the simple fact of

42 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

their articulation the proceedings and the verdict unceasingly reiterate the
crime. If the Order of which we are speaking is so powerful, if its
power is unique of its kind, this is so precisely by virtue of the universal, structural, universal, and infinite complicity in which it compromises all those who understand it in its own language, even when
this language provides them with the form of their own denunciation.
Order is then denounced within order.
Total disengagement from the totality of the historical language
responsible for the exile of madness, liberation from this language in
order to write the archaeology of silence, would be possible in only two
ways.
Either do not mention a certain silence (a certain silence which, again, can
be determined only within a language and an order that will preserve this
silence from contamination by any given muteness), or follow the
madman down the road of his exile. The misfortune of the mad, the
interminable misfortune of their silence, is that their best spokesmen

are those who betray them best; which is to say that when one attempts
to convey their silence itself, one has already passed over to the side of the
enemy, the side of order, even if one fights against order from
within it, putting its origin into question. There is no Trojan horse
unconquerable by Reason (in general). The unsurpassable, unique, and

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS

is, an archaeology against reason doubtless cannot be written, for, des
pite all appearances to the contrary, the concept of history has always
been a rational one. It is the meaning of "history" or archia that should
have been questioned first, perhaps. A writing that exceeds, by ques
tioning them, the values "origin," "reason," and "history" could not
be contained within the metaphysical closure of an archaeology.
As Foucault is the first to be conscious-and acutely so-of this daring,
of the necessity of speaking and of drawing his language from the
wellspring of a reason more profound than the reason which issued forth
during the classical age, and as he experiences a necessity of speaking which
must escape the objectivist project ofclassical reason-a necessity of
speaking even at the price of a war declared by the language of reason
against itself, a war in which language would recapture itself, destroy
itself, or unceasingly revive the act of its own destruction-the
allegation of an archaeology of silence, a purist, intransigent, nonviolent,
nondialectical allegation, rs often counterbalanced, equilibrated, l should
even say contradicted by a discourse in Foucault's book that is not only the
admission of a difficulty, but the formulation of another project, a project that
is not an expediency, but a different and more ambitious one, a project more
effectively ambitious than the first one.
The admission of the difficulty can be found in sentences such as
these, among others, which I simply cite, in order not to deprive you

another actual order or structure (a determined historical structure,;
one structure among other possible ones), is that one cannot speak out
against it except by being for it, that one can protest it only from within
it; and within its domain, Reason leaves us only the recourse to'
strategems and strategies. The revolution against reason, in the histor
ical form of classical reason (but the latter is only a determined
example of Reason in general. And because of this oneness of Reason the
expression "history of reason" is difficult to conceptualize, as is
also, consequently, a "history of madness"), the revolution against
reason can be made only within it, in accordance with a Hegelian la
to which I myself was very sensitive in Foucault's book, despite, th
absence of any precise reference to Hegel. Since the revolution again
reason, from the moment it is articulated, can operate only within rea+
son, it always has the limited scope of what is called, precisely in th
language of a department of internal affairs, a disturbance. A history, tha

43

of their dense beauty: "The perception that seeks to grasp them [in
question are the miseries and murinurings of madness] in their wild
state, necessarily belongs to a world that has already captured them.
ress that holds madness prisoner. And there madness possesses only the
morose sum of its prison experiences, its mute experience of persecu
don, and we-we possess only its description as a man wanted." And, later,
Foucault speaks of a madness "whose wild state can never be
restored in and of itself' and of an "inaccessible primitive purity.,,
the language used to describe this history of madness, Foucault, in
effect, acknowledges the necessity of maintaining his discourse within
what he calls a "relativity without recourse," that is, without support from
an absolute reason or logos. The simultaneous necessity and

44 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

impossibility of what Foucault elsewhere calls "a language without
support," that is to say, a language declining, in principle if not in fact, to
articulate itself along the lines of the syntax of reason. In principle if not in
fact, but here the fact cannot easily be put between parentheses. The fact
of language is probably the only fact ultimately to resist all
parenthization. "There, in the simple problem of articulation,"
Foucault says later, "was hidden and expressed the major difficulty of the
enterprise."
One could perhaps say that the resolution of this difficulty is practiced rather
than formulated. By necessity. I mean that the silence of madness is
not said, cannot be said in the logos of this book, but is indirectly,
metaphorically, made present by its pathos taking this word in its best
sense. A new and radical praise of folly whose intentions cannot be
admitted because the praise [eloge] of silence always takes place within logos,'
the language of objectification. "To speak well of madness" would be
to annex it once more, especially when, as is the case here, "speaking
well of is also the wisdom and happiness of eloquent speech.
Now, to state the difficulty, to state the difficulty of stating, is not ye to
surmount it-quite the contrary. First, it is not to say in which language, through the agency of what speech, the difficulty is stated. Who
perceives, who enunciates the difficulty? These efforts can be made neither
in the wild and inaccessible silence of madness, nor simply in the language
of the jailer, that is, in the language of classical reason, but only in the
language of someone for whom is meaningful and before whom appears the
dialogue or war or misunderstanding or confrontation or double
monologue that opposes reason and madness during the classical age.
And thereby we can envision the historic liberation of a logos in which the
two monologues, or the broken dialogue, or especially the breaking
point of the dialogue between a determined reason and a,

determined madness, could be produced and can today be understood
and enunciated. (Supposing that they can be; but here we are assuming ,`
Foucault's hypothesis.)
Therefore, if Foucault's book, despite all the acknowledged impossi
bilities and difficulties, was capable of being written, we have the right
to ask what, in the last resort, supports this language without recourse '`
or support: who enunciates the possibility of nonrecourse? Who wrote '.

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS

45

and who is to understand, in what language and from what historical
situation of logos, who wrote and who is to understand this history of
madness? For it is not by chance that such a project could take shape
today. Without forgetting, quite to the contrary, the audacity of Foucault's act in
the History of Madness, we must assume that a certain liberation of madness
has gotten underway, that psychiatry has opened itself up, however
minimally, and that the concept of madness as unreason, if it
ever had a unity, has been dislocated. And that a project such as
Foucault's can find its historical origin and passageway in the opening
produced by this dislocation.
If Foucault, more than anyone else, is attentive and sensitive to these
kinds of questions, it nevertheless appears that he does not acknowledge
their quality of being prerequisite methodological or philosophical
considerations. And it is true that once the question and the privileged
difficulty are understood, to devote a preliminary work to them would
have entailed the sterilization or paralysis of all further inquiry. Inquiry
can prove through its very act that the movement of a discourse on
madness is possible. But is not the foundation of this possibility still too
classical?
Foucault's book is not one of those that abandons itself to the prospective lightheartedness of inquiry. That is why, behind the admission of
the difficulty concerning the archaeology of silence, a different project

must be discerned, one which perhaps contradicts the projected
archaeology of silence.
Because the silence whose archaeology is to be undertaken is not an
original muteness or nondiscourse, but a subsequent silence, a dis
course arrested by command, the issue is therefore to reach the origin of the
protectionism imposed by a reason that insists upon being sheltered, and
that also insists upon providing itself with protective barriers against
madness, thereby making itself into a barrier against madness; and to reach
this origin from within a logos of free trade, that is, from within a logos
that preceded the split of reason and madness, a logos which within itself
permitted dialogue between what were later called reason and madness
(unreason), permitted their free circulation and exchange, just as the
medieval city permitted the free circulation of the mad within itself
The issue is therefore to reach the point at which the dialogue was
broken off, dividing itself into two soliloquies-what

46 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
Foucault calls, using a very strong word, the Decision. The Decision,
through a single act, links and separates reason and madness, and it
must be understood at once both as the original act of an order, a fiat, a
decree, and as a schism, a caesura, a separation, a dissection. I would
prefer dissension, to underline that in question is a self-dividing action, a
cleavage and torment interior to meaning in general, interior to logos in
general, a divison within the very act of sentire. As always, the dissension is
internal. The exterior (is) the interior, is the fission that produces and
divides it along the lines of the Hegelian Entzweiung.
It thus seems that the project of convoking the first dissension of
logos against itself is quite another project than the archaeology of
silence, and raises different questions. This time it would be necessary to
exhume the virgin and unitary ground upon which the decisive act
linking and separating madness and reason obscurely took root. The

reason and madness of the classical age had a common root. But this
common root, which is a logos, this unitary foundation is much more
ancient than the medieval period, brilliantly but briefly evoked by
Foucault in his very fine opening chapter. There must be a founding
unity that already carries within it the "free trade" of the Middle Ages, and
this unity is already the unity of a logos, that is, of a reason; an already
historical reason certainly, but a reason much less determined
than it will be in its so-called classical form, having not yet received the
determinations of the "classical age." It is within the element of this
archaic reason that the dissection, the dissension, will present itself as a
modification or, if you will, as an overturning, that is, a revolution bu
an internal revolution, a revolution affecting the self, occurring within
the self. For this logos which is in the beginning, is not only the
common ground of all dissension, but also-and no less importantly=

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS 47
Whatever the momentary break, if there is one, of the Middle Ages
with the Greek tradition, this break and this alteration are late and
secondary developments as concerns the fundamental permanence of the
logico-philosophical heritage.
That the embedding of the decision in its true historical grounds has
been left in the shadows by Foucault is bothersome, and for at least two
reasons:
1. It is bothersome because at the outset Foucault makes a somewhat
enigmatic allusion to the Greek logos, saying that, unlike classical
reason, it "had no contrary." To cite Foucault: "The Greeks had a
relation to something that they called hybris. This relation was not
merely one of condemnation; the existence of Thrasymacus or of Callicles
suffices to prove it, even if their language has reached us already

enveloped in the reassuri

n gae c t c oo cr a t e s . B ut t he G r e e k L ogo s

had no contrary."'
[One would have to assume, then, that the Greek logos had no
proximity to the elementary, primordial, and undivided Logos with
respect to which contradiction in general, all wars or polemics, could
only be ulterior developments. This hypothesis forces us to admit, as
Foucault above all does not, that the history and lineage of the "reassur
ing dialectic of Socrates" in their totality had already fallen outside
and been exiled from this Greek logos that had no contrary. For if the

remain to be examined. Or (b) that the Socratic moment and the victory
over the Calliclesian hybris already are the marks of a deportation and an
exile of logos from itself, the wounds left in it by a decision, a difference;
and then the structure of exclusion which Foucault wishes to describe in his
book could not have been born with classical reason. It would have to have
been consummated and reassured and smoothed over throughout all the
centuries of philosophy. It would be essential to the entirety of the
history of philosophy and of reason. In this regard, the classical age
could have neither specificity nor privilege. And all the signs assembled
by Foucault under the chapter heading Stultifera navis would play
themselves out only on the surface of a chronic dissension. The free circulation
of the mad, besides the fact that it is not as simply free as all that, would
only be a socioeconomic epiphenomenon on the surface of a reason
divided against itself since the dawn of its Greek origin. What seems to
me sure in any case, regardless of the hypothesis one chooses concerning
what is doubtless only a false problem and a false alternative, is that Foucault
cannot simultaneously save the affirmation of a reassuring dialectic of
Socrates and his postulation of a specificity of the classical age whose
reason would reassure itself by excluding its contrary, that is, by
constituting its contrary as an object in order to be protected from it and
be rid of it. In order to lock it up.
The attempt to write the history of the decision, division, difference
runs the risk of construing the division as an event or a structure
subsequent to the unity of an original presence, thereby confirming
metaphysics in its fundamental operation.
Truthfully, for one or the other of these hypotheses to be true and for
there to be a real choice between them, it must be assumed in general that
reason can have a contrary, that there can be an other of reason, that reason
itself can construct or discover, and that the opposition of reason to its
other is symmetrical. This is the heart of the matter. Permit me to
hold off on this question.
However one interprets the situation of classical reason, notably as
regards the Greek logos (and whether or not this latter experienced
dissension) in all cases a doctrine of tradition, of the tradition of logos (is
there any other?) seems to be the prerequisite implied by Foucault s
enterprise. No matter what the relationship of the Greeks to hybris, a
relationship that was certainly not simple ... (Here, I wish to open a

parenthesis and a question: in the name of what invariable meaning of
"madness" does Foucault associate, whatever the meaning of this
association, Madness and Hybris? A problem of translation, a philosophical problem of translation is posed-and it is serious-even if Hybris is not
Madness for Foucault. The determination of their difference supposes a
hazardous linguistic transition. The frequent imprudence of translators in
this respect should make us very wary. I am thinking in particular, and in
passing, of what is translated by madness and fury in the Philebus (45e).9
Further, if madness has an invariable meaning, what is the relation of this
meaning to the a posteriori events which govern Foucault's analysis? For,
despite everything, even if his method is not empiricist, Foucault proceeds
by inquiry and inquest. What he is writing is a history, and the recourse
to events, in the last resort, is indispensable and determining, at least in
principle. Now, is not the concept of madness-never submitted to a
thematic scrutiny by Foucault-today a false and disintegrated concept,
outside current and popular language which always lags longer than it
should behind its subversion by science and philosophy? Foucault, in
rejecting the psychiatric or philosophical material that has always
emprisoned the mad, winds up employing-inevitably-a popular and
equivocal notion of madness, taken from an unverifiable source. This
would not be serious if Foucault used the word only in quotation marks,
as if it were the language of others, of those who, during the period under
study, used it as a historical instrument. But everything transpires as if
Foucault knew what "madness" means. Everything transpires as if, in a
continuous and underlying way, an assured and rigorous precomprehension
of the concept of madness, or at least of its nominal definition, were
possible and acquired. In fact, however, it could be demonstrated that as
Foucault intends it, if not as intended by the historical current he is
studying, the concept of madness overlaps everything that can be put
under the rubric of negativity. One can imagine the kind of problems posed by
such a usage of the notion of madness. The same kind of questions
could be posed concerning the notion of truth that runs throughout the
book ... I close this long parenthesis.) Thus, whatever the relation of the
Greeks to hybris, and of Socrates to the original logos, it is in any event
certain that classical reason, and medieval reason before it, bore a
relation to Greek reason, and that it is within the

SO WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
milieu of this more or less immediately perceived heritage, which itself is
more or less crossed with other traditional lines, that the adventure or
misadventure of classical reason developed. If dissension dates from
Socrates, then the situation of the madman in the Socratic and postSocratic worlds-assuming that there is, then, something that can be
called mad-perhaps deserves to be examined first. Without this examination, and as Foucault does not proceed in a simply aprioristic fashion,
his historical description poses the banal but inevitable problems of
periodization and of geographical, political, ethnological limitation,
etc. If, on the contrary, the unopposed and unexcluding unity of logos were
maintained until the classical "crisis," then this latter is, if I may say so,
secondary and derivative. It does not engage the entirety of
reason. And in this case, even if stated in passing, Socratic discourse
would be nothing less than reassuring. It can be proposed that the
classical crisis developed from and within the elementary tradition of a
logos that has no opposite but carries within itself and says all determined contradictions. This doctrine of the tradition of meaning and of
reason would be even further necessitated by the fact that it alone can give
meaning and rationality in general to Foucault's discourse and to any
discourse on the war between reason and unreason. For these
discourses intend above all to be understood.]
2. I stated above that leaving the history of the preclassical logos in the
shadows is bothersome for two reasons. The second reason, which I will
adduce briefly before going on to Descartes, has to do with the
profound link established by Foucault between the division, the dissension,
and the possibility of history itself. "The necessity of madness, throughout the
history of the West, is linked to the deciding gesture which
detaches from the background noise, and from its continuous
monotony, a meaningful language that is transmitted and consummated in
time; briefly, it is linked to the possibility of history."
Consequently, if the decision through which reason constitutes itself
by excluding and objectifying the free subjectivity of madness is
indeed the origin of history, if it is historicity itself, the condition of
meaning and of language, the condition of the tradition of meaning,
the condition of the work in general, if the structure of exclusion is th
fundamental structure of historicity, then the "classical" moment o this
exclusion described by Foucault has neither absolute privilege no

archetypal exemplarity. It is an example as sample and not as model. In any
event, in order to evoke the singularity of the classical moment, which
is profound, perhaps it would be necessary to underline, not the aspects
in which it is a structure of exclusion, but those aspects in which, and
especially for what end, its own structure of exclusion is historically
distinguished from the others, from all others. And to pose the problem of
its exemplarity: are we concerned with an example among others or
with a "good example," an example that is revelatory by privilege?
Formidable and infinitely difficult problems that haunt Foucault's book,
more present in his intentions than his words.
Finally, a last question: if this great division is the possibility of history itself,
the historicity of history, what does it mean, here, "to write the history of
this division"? To write the history of historicity? To write the history of
the origin of history? The hysteron proteron would not here be a simple
"logical fallacy," a fallacy within logic, within an established rationality.
And its denunciation is not an act of ratiocination. If there is a historicity
proper to reason in general, the history of reason cannot be the history
of its origin (which, for a start, demands the historicity of reason in
general), but must be that of one of its determined figures.
This second project, which would devote all its efforts to discovering the
common root of meaning and nonmeaning and to unearthing the

original logos in which a language and a silence are divided from one
another is not at all an expediency as concerns everything that could
come under the heading "archaeology of silence," the archaeology
which simultaneously claims to say madness itself and renounces this
claim. The expression "to say madness itself" is self-contradictory. To say
madness without expelling it into objectivity is to let it say itself
But madness is what by essence cannot be said: it is the "absence of the
work," as Foucault profoundly says.
Thus, not an expediency, but a different and more ambitious design,
one that should lead to a praise of reason (there is no praise [eloge], by
essence, except of reason),10 but this time of a reason more profound
than that which opposes and determines itself in a historically deter
mined conflict. Hegel again, always ... Not an expediency, but a more
ambitious ambition, even if Foucault writes this: "Lacking this inaccess
ible primitive purity [of madness itself], a structural study must go

51

52

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

back toward the decision that simultaneously links and separates reason and
madness; it must aim to uncover the perpetual exchange, the obscure
common root, the original confrontation that gives meaning to the
unity, as well as to the opposition, of sense and non-sense" [my italics].
Before describing the moment when the reason of the classical age will
reduce madness to silence by what he calls a "strange act of force,"
Foucault shows how the exclusion and internment of madness found a sort
of structural niche prepared for it by the history of another exclusion: the
exclusion of leprosy. Unfortunately, we cannot be detained by the brilliant
passages of the chapter entitled Stultifera navis. They would also pose
numerous questions.
We thus come to the "act of force," to the great internment which,
with the creation of the houses of internment for the mad and others in the
middle of the seventeenth century, marks the advent and first stage of a
classical process described by Foucault throughout his book. Without
establishing, moreover, whether an event such as the creation of a house of
internment is a sign among others, whether it is a fundamental
symptom or a cause. This kind of question could appear

exterior to a method that presents itself precisely as structuralist1 that is,

as a prelude to the historical and sociopolitical drama, to set the tone
for the entire drama to be played. Is this "act of force," described in the
dimension of theoretical knowledge and metaphysics, a symptom, a
cause, a language? What must be assumed or elucidated so that the
meaning of this question or dissociation can be neutralized? And if this act
of force has a structural affinity with the totality of the drama, what is the
status of this affinity? Finally, whatever the place reserved for philosophy in
this total historical structure may be, why the sole choice of the Cartesian
example? What is the exemplarity of Descartes, while so many other
philosophers of the same era were interested or-no less significantly-not
interested in madness in various ways?
Foucault does not respond directly to any of these more than methodological questions, summarily, but inevitably, invoked. A single sentence,
in his preface, settles the question. To cite Foucault: "To write the history of
madness thus will mean the execution of a structural study of an
historical ensemble-notions, institutions, juridical and police measures,
scientific concepts-which holds captive a madness whose wild state can
never in itself be restored." How are these elements organized in the
"historical ensemble"? What is a "notion"? Do philosophical notions have
a privilege? How are they related to scientific concepts? A quantity of
questions that besiege this enterprise.
I do not know to what extent Foucault would agree that the prerequisite for a response to such questions is first of all the internal and
autonomous analysis of the philosophical content of philosophical discourse.
Only when the totality of this content will have become manifest in its
meaning for me (but this is impossible) will I rigorously be

great internment." It thus opens the book itself, and its location at the
beginning of the chapter is fairly unexpected. More than anywhere' _'
else, the question I have just asked seems to me unavoidable here. We are
not told whether or not this passage of the first Meditation, inter
preted by Foucault as a philosophical internment of madness, is destined,

able to situate it in its total historical form. It is only then that its
reinsertion will not do it violence, that there will be a legitimate
reinsertion of this philosophical meaning itself. As to Descartes in particular, no
historical question about him-about the latent historical
meaning of his discourse, about its place in a total structure-can be
answered before a rigorous and exhaustive internal analysis of his
manifest intentions, of the manifest meaning of his philosophical
discourse has been made.
We will now turn to this manifest meaning, this properly philosophical intention that is not legible in the immediacy of a first
encounter. But first by reading over Foucault's shoulder.

Descartes, then, is alleged to have executed the act of force in the first of the
Meditations, and it would very summarily consist in a summary expulsion
of the possibility of madness from thought itself
I shall first cite the decisive passage from Descartes, the one cited by
Foucault. Then we shall follow Foucault's reading of the text. Finally, we
shall establish a dialogue between Descartes and Foucault.
Descartes writes the following (at the moment when he undertakes to
rid himself of all the opinions in which lie had hitherto believed, and to
start all over again from the foundations: a primis fundamentis. To do so, it
will suffice to ruin the ancient foundations without being obliged to
submit all his opinions to doubt one by one, for the ruin of the
foundations brings down the entire edifice. One of these fragile
foundations of knowledge, the most naturally apparent, is sensation. The
senses deceive me sometimes; they can thus deceive me all the time,
and I will therefore submit to doubt all knowledge whose origin is in
sensation): "All that up to the present time I have accepted as most true and
certain I have learned either from the senses or through the senses; but
it is sometimes proved to me that these senses are deceptive, and it is wiser
not to trust entirely to any thing by which we have once

been deceived."
Descartes starts a new paragraph.
"But . . . " (sed forte ... I insist upon the forte which the Duc de Luynes left
untranslated, an omission that Descartes did not deem necessary to
correct when he went over the translation. It is better, as Baillet says,
to compare "the French with the Latin" when reading the Meditations. It is
only in the second French edition by Clerselier that the sed forte is given
its full weight and is translated by "but yet perhaps ... " The import

And now the most significant sentence in Foucault's eyes: "But they are

(demens) were I to follow examples so extravagant . " I I
I interrupt my citation not at the end of this paragraph, but on the
first words of the following paragraph, which reinscribe the lines I have just
read in a rhetorical and pedagogical movement with highly compressed
articulations. These first words are Praeclare sane ... Also translated as toutefois
[but at the same time-trans.]. And this is the beginning of a paragraph in
which Descartes imagines that he can always dream, and that the world
might be no more real than his dreams. And he generalizes by hyperbole
the hypothesis of sleep and dream ("Now let us assume that we are asleep ...

notably, which are true "whether I am awake or asleep" and which will
capitulate only to the artificial and metaphysical assault of the evil genius.
How does Foucault read this text?
According to Foucault, Descartes, encountering madness alongside (the
expression alongside is Foucault's) dreams and all forms of sensory error,
refuses to accord them all the same treatment, so to speak. "In the economy
between madness, on the one hand, and error, on the other ..." (I note in
passing that elsewhere Foucault often denounces the classical reduction of
madness to error.) He pursues: "Descartes does not avoid the peril of madness
in the same way he circumvents the eventuality of dream and error."
Foucault establishes a parallelism between the following two procedures:
I. The one by which Descartes wishes to demonstrate that the

senses can deceive us only regarding "things which are hardly perceptible, or very far away. These would be the limits of the error of sensory
origin. And in the passage I just read, Descartes did say: "But it may be that
although the senses sometimes deceive us concerning things which are
hardly perceptible, or very far away, there are yet many others to be met
with as to which we cannot reasonably have any doubt ..." Unless one is
mad, a hypothesis seemingly excluded in principle by Descartes in the same
passage.

madness, he does not welcome it as a hypothesis, he does not consider it.
He excludes it by decree. I would be insane if I thought that I had a body
made of glass. But this is excluded, since I am thinking. Anticipating the
moment of the Cogito, which will have to await the completion of
numerous stages, highly rigorous in their succession, Foucault writes:
"impossibility of being mad that is essential not to the object of thought, but
to the thinking subject." Madness is expelled, rejected, denounced in its
very impossibility from the very interiority of thought itself
Foucault is the first, to my knowledge, to have isolated delirium and
madness from sensation and dreams in this first Meditation. The first to
have isolated them in their philosophical sense and their methodological function. Such is the originality of his reading. But if the
classical interpreters did not deem this dissociation auspicious, is it because
of their inattentiveness? Before answering this questio

simple reason that he apparently does not ever, nor in any way, surmount them or circumvent them, and does not ever set aside the
possibility of total error for all knowledge gained from the senses or
from imaginary constructions. It must be understood that the hypothesis
of dreams is the radicalization or, if you will, the hyperbolical
exaggeration of the hypothesis according to which the senses could
sometimes deceive me. In dreams, the totality of sensory images is illusory. It
follows that a certainty invulnerable to dreams would be a fortiori
invulnerable to perceptual illusions of the sensory kind. It therefore suffices
to examine the case of dreams in order to deal with, on the level which
is ours for the moment, the case of natural doubt, of sensory
perception, and therefore also escape sensory error or imaginative and

For, as a matter of fact, painters, even when they study with the great
est skill to represent sirens and satyrs by forms the most strange and
extraordinary, cannot give them natures which are entirely new, but
merely make a certain medley of the members of different animals; or
if their imagination is extravagant enough to invent something so
novel that nothing similar has ever before been seen, and that then their
work represents a thing purely fictitious and absolutely false, it is certain all
the same that the colours of which this is composed are necessarily real.
And for the same reason, although these general things, to wit, a body, eyes, a
head, hands, and such like, may be imaginary, we are bound at the same time
to confess that there are at least some other objects yet more simple and
more universal, which are real and true; and of these just in the same way as
with certain real colours, all these images of things which dwell in our
thoughts, whether true and real or false and fantastic, are formed.
To such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general, and its
extension, the figure of extended things, their quantity or magnitude and
number, as also the place in which they are, the time which measures their

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS

And I remark that the following paragraph also starts with a "nevertheless"
(verumtamen) which will soon be brought to our attention.
Thus the certainty of this simplicity of intelligible generalizationwhich
is soon after submitted to metaphysical, artificial, and hyperbolical
doubt through the fiction of the evil genius-is in no way obtained by
a continuous reduction which finally lays bare the resistance of a nucleus
of sensory or imaginative certainty. There is discontinuity and a
transition to another order of reasoning. The nucleus is purely intelligible,
and the still natural and provisional certainty which has been attained
supposes a radical break with the senses. At this moment of the analysis,
no imaginative or sensory signification, as such, has been saved, no
invulnerability of the senses to doubt has been experienced. All
significations or "ideas" of sensory origin are excluded from the realm of truth,
for the same reason as madness is excluded from it. And there is nothing
astonishing about this: madness is only a particular case, and, moreover,
not the most serious one, of the sensory illusion which interests
Descartes at this point. It can thus be stated that:
2. The hypothesis of insanity-at this moment of the Cartesian
order-seems neither to receive any privileged treatment nor to be
submitted to any particular exclusion. Let us reread, in effect, the passage
cited by Fou.cault in which insanity appears. Let us resituate it. Descartes
has just remarked that since the senses sometimes deceive us,'.

"it is wiser not to trust entirely to any thing by which we have once'
been deceived." He then starts a new paragraph with the sed forte
which I brought to your attention a few moments ago. Now, the entire
paragraph which follows does not express Descartes's final, definitive
conclusions, but rather the astonishment and objections of the non
philosopher, of the novice in philosophy who is frightened by this
doubt and protests, saying: I am willing to let you doubt certain
sensory perceptions concerning "things which are hardly perceptible, or
very far away," but the others! that you are in this place, sitting by the fire,
speaking thus, this paper in your hands and other seeming
certainties! Descartes then assumes the astonishment of this reader o
naive interlocutor, pretends to take him into account when he writes
"And how could I deny that these hands and this body are mine, were I not
perhaps that I compare myself to certain persons, devoid of sense

61

whose ... and I should not be any the less insane were I to follow
examples so extravagant."
The pedagogical and rhetorical sense of the sed forte which governs this
paragraph is clear. It is the "but perhaps" of the feigned objection.
Descartes has just said that all knowledge of sensory origin could
deceive him. He pretends to put to himself the astonished objection of an
imaginary nonphilosopher who is frightened by such audacity and says:
no, not all sensory knowledge, for then you would be mad and it
thuldideasbeounreasodmen
ma
f
nable to follow the example of madmen, to put forth
e
. Descartes echoes this objection: since I am here,
writing, and you understand me, I am not mad, nor are you, and we
are all sane. The example of madness is therefore not indicative of the
fragility of the sensory idea. So be it. Descartes acquiesces to this nat
ural point of view, or rather he feigns to rest in this natural comfort in
order better, more radically and more definitively, to unsettle himself
from it and to discomfort his interlocutor. So be it, he says, you think
that I would be mad to doubt that I am sitting near the fire, etc., that I
ould be insane to follow the example of madmen. I will therefore
propose a hypothesis which will seem much more natural to you, will
not disorient you, because it concerns a more common, and more
universal experience than that of madness: the experience of sleep and
dreams. Descartes then elaborates the hypothesis that will ruin all the
sensory foundations of knowledge and will lay bare only the intellectual
foundations of certainty. This hypothesis above all will not run from
the possibility of an insanity-an epistemological one-much more
serious than madness.
The reference to dreams is therefore not put off to one side-quite
the contrary-in relation to a madness potentially respected or even
excluded by Descartes. It constitutes, in the methodical order which here
is ours, the hyperbolical exasperation of the hypothesis of madness. This
latter affected only certain areas of sensory perception, and in a contingent and
partial way. Moreover, Descartes is concerned here not with determining the
concept of madness but with utilizing the popular notion of insanity for
juridical and methodological ends, in order to ask questions of principle
regarding only the truth of ideas. IS What must be grasped here is that from this
point of view the sleeper, or the dreamer, is madder than the madman. Or,
at least, the dreamer, insofar
wo

62

as concerns the problem of knowledge which interests Descartes here, is
further from true perception than the madman. It is in the case of sleep,
and not in that of insanity, that the absolute totality of ideas of sensory
origin becomes suspect, is stripped of "objective value" as M. Gueroult
puts it. The hypothesis of insanity is therefore not a good example, a
revelatory example, a good instrument of doubt-and for at least two
reasons. (a) It does not cover the totality of the field of sensory perception.
The madman is not always wrong about everything; he is not wrong often
enough, is never mad enough. (b) It is not a useful or happy example
pedagogically, because it meets the resistance of the nonphilosopher who
does not have the audacity to follow the philosopher when the latter
agrees that he might indeed be mad at the very

moment when he speaks.
Let us turn to Foucault once more. Confronted with the situation of the
Cartesian text whose principles I have just indicated. Foucault couldand this time I am only extending the logic of his book without basing
what I say on any particular text-Foucault could recall two truths that on
a second reading would justify his interpretations, which would then
only apparently differ from the interpretation I have just
proposed.
1. It appears, on this second reading, that, for Descartes, madness is
thought of only as a single case-and not the most serious one-among. all
cases of sensory error. (Foucault would then assume the perspective
of the factual determination of the concept of madness by Descartes,
and not his juridical usage of it.) Madness is only a sensory and corporeal
fault, a bit more serious than the fault which threatens all waking
but normal men, and much less serious, within the epistemological
order, than the fault to which we succumb in dreams. Foucault would
then doubtless ask whether this reduction of madness to an example, to
a case of sensory error, does not constitute an exclusion, an internment
and everything relative to the intellect and reason from madness. IC

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS

Cogito. I cannot be mad when I think and when I have clear and
distinct ideas.
2. Or, while assuming our hypothesis, Foucault could also recall the
following: Descartes, by inscribing his reference to madness within the
problematic of knowledge, by making madness not only a thing of the
body but an error of the body, by concerning himself with madness only as
the modification of ideas, or the faculties of representation or judgment,
intends to neutralize the originality of madness. He would even, in the
long run, be condemned to construe it, like all errors, not only as an
epistemological deficiency but also as a moral failure linked to a
precipitation of the will; for will alone can consecrate the intellectual
finitude of perception as error. It is only one step from here to making
madness a sin, a step that was soon after cheerfully taken, as Foucault
convincingly demonstrates in other chapters.
Foucault would be perfectly correct in recalling these two truths to us if
we were to remain at the naive, natural, and premetaphysical stage of
Descartes's itinerary, the stage marked by natural doubt as it intervenes in
the passage that Foucault cites. However, it seems that these two truths
become vulnerable in turn, as soon as we come to the properly
philosophical, metaphysical, and critical phase of doubt. I6
Let us first notice how, in the rhetoric of the first Meditation, the first
toutefois [at the same time] which announced the "natural" hyperbole of
dreams (just after Descartes says, "But they are mad, and I should not be
any the less insane," etc.) is succeeded by a second toutefois
[nevertheless] at the beginning of the next paragraph." To "at the
same

time," marking the hyperbolical moment within natural doubt, will correspond
" " a nevertheless, marking the absolutely hyperbolical moment which gets us out
of natural doubt and leads to the hypothesis of the evil genius.
Descartes has just admitted that arithmetic, geometry, and simple notions
escape the first doubt, and he writes, "Nevertheless I have long
had fixed in my mind the belief that an all-powerful God existed by
whom I have been created such as I am."" This is the onset of the

madness is only a perversion of the senses-or of the imagination-it is
corporeal, in alliance with the body. The real distinction of substance
expels madness to the outer shadows of the Cogito. Madness, to use an

ell-known movement leading to the fiction of the evil genius.
Now, the recourse to the fiction of the evil genius will evoke,
conjure up, the possibility of a total madness, a total derangement over
'which I could have no control because it is inflicted upon me

of the exterior and to the exterior of the interior. It is the other of the

is the possibility of a madness that is no longer a disorder of the body, of
the object, the body-object outside the boundaries of the res cogitans,
outside the boundaries of the policed city, secure in its existence as
thinking subjectivity, but is a madness that will bring subversion to pure
thought and to its purely intelligible objects, to the field of its clear and
distinct ideas, to the realm of the mathematical truths which escape
natural doubt.

designating the content from which form takes off by force, and the
adversary against whom I assure and reassure myself by force.
Although the silence of madness is the absence of a work, this silence is
not simply the work's epigraph, nor is it, as concerns language and
meaning, outside the work. Like nonmeaning, silence is the work's
limit and profound resource. Of course, in essentializing madness this
way one runs the risk of disintegrating the factual findings of psychiatric efforts. This is a permanent danger, but it should not discourage
the demanding and patient psychiatrist.
So that, to come back to Descartes, any philosopher or speaking
subject (and the philosopher is but the speaking subject par excellence) who
must evoke madness from the interior of thought (and not only
from within the body or some other extrinsic agency), can do so only in
the realm of the possible and in the language of fiction or the fiction of
language. Thereby, through his own language, he reassures himself
tive, another problem-and can keep his distance, the distance
indispensable for continuing to speak and to live. But this is not a
weakness or a search for security proper to a given historical language
(for example, the search for certainty in the Cartesian style), but is
rather inherent in the essence and very project of all language in gen
eral; and even in the language of those who are apparently the maddest;
and even and above all in the language of those who, by their praise of
madness, by their complicity with it, measure their own strength
against the greatest possible proximity to madness. Language being the
break with madness, it adheres more thoroughly to its essence and
vocation, makes a cleaner break with madness, if it pits itself against
madness more freely and gets closer and closer to it: to the point o
being separated from it only by the "transparent sheet" of which Joyce
speaks, that is, by itself-for this diaphaneity is nothing other than the
language, meaning, possibility, and elementary discretion of a nothing''
that neutralizes everything. In this sense, I would be tempted to con
sider Foucault's book a powerful gesture of protection and internment.
A Cartesian gesture for the twentieth century. A reappropriation of;
negativity. To all appearances, it is reason that he interns, but, like

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS 67 2.

As for the second truth Foucault could have countered with, it
ly
onseemsceasesvatolidreonlyectduring the natural phase of doubt. Descartes not
j madness during the phase of radical doubt, he not
only installs its possible menace at the very heart of the intelligible, he
also in principle refuses to let any determined knowledge escape from
madness. A menace to all knowledge, insanity-the hypothesis of
insanity-is not an internal modification of knowledge. At no point will
knowledge alone be able to dominate madness, to master it in order to
objectify it-at least for as long as doubt remains unresolved. For the
end of doubt poses a problem to which we shall return in a moment.
The act of the Cogito and the certainty of existing indeed escape
madness the first time; but aside from the fact that for the first time, it is no
longer a question of objective, representative knowledge, it can no longer
literally be said that the Cogito would escape madness because it keeps itself
beyond the grasp of madness, or because, as Foucault says, "I who think, I
cannot be mad"; the Cogito escapes madness only because at its own
moment, under its own authority, it is valid even if I am mad, even if
my thoughts are completely mad. There is a value and a meaning of the
Cogito, as of existence, which escape the alternative of a determined
madness or a determined reason. Confronted with the critical experience
of the Cogito, insanity, as stated in the Discourse on Method, is
irremediably on a plane with scepticism. Thought no longer
too

so certain and so assured that all the most extravagant suppositions
brought forward by the sceptics were incapable of shaking it."23 The
certainty thus attained need not be sheltered from an emprisoned
madness, for it is attained and ascertained within madness itself it is valid
even if I am mad-a supreme self-confidence that seems to require neither
the exclusion nor the circumventing of madness. Descartes never interns
madness, neither at the stage of natural doubt nor at the
the first stage, during the nonhyperbolical moment of natural doubt.
The hyperbolical audacity of the Cartesian Cogito, its mad audacity,
cartes's contemporary, we are too well assured of ourselves and too

68 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

an original point which no longer belongs to either a determined reason or a
determined unreason, no longer belongs to them as opposition or
alternative. Whether I atn mad or not, Cogito, sum. Madness is therefore, in
every sense of the word, only one case of thought (within thought). It
is therefore a question of drawing back toward a point at which all
determined contradictions, in the form of given, factual historical
structures, can appear, and appear as relative to this zero point at which
determined meaning and nonmeaning come together in their com-n mon
origin. From the point of view which here is ours, one could
perhaps say the following about this zero point, determined by
Descartes as Cogito.
Invulnerable to all determined opposition between reason and
unreason, it is the point starting from which the history of the determined forms of this opposition, this opened or broken-off dialogue, can
appear as such and be stated. It is the impenetrable point of certainty in
which the possibility of Foucault's narration, as well as of the narration of
the totality, or rather of all the determined forms of the

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS 69

nothing is less reassuring than the Cogito at its proper and inaugural
moment. The project of exceeding the totality of the world, as the
totality of what I can think in general, is no more reassuring than the
dialectic of Socrates when it, too, overflows the totality of beings,
planting us in the light of a hidden sun which is epekeina tes ousias. And
Glaucon was not mistaken when he cried out: "Lord! what demonic
hyperbole? daimonias hyperboles," which is perhaps banally translated as
"marvelous transcendence."25 This demonic hyperbole goes further than
the passion of hybris, at least if this latter is seen only as the
pathological modification of the being called man. Such a hybris keeps itself
within the world. Assuming that it is deranged and excessive, it implies
the fundamental derangement and excessiveness of the hyperbole which
opens and founds the world as such by exceeding it. Hybris is excessive and
exceeds only within the space opened by the demonic hyperbole.
The extent to which doubt and the Cartesian Cogito are punctuated by this
project of a singular and unprecedented excess-an excess in the
direction of the nondeterinined, Nothingness or Infinity, an excess

exchanges between reason and madness are embedded. It is the point' at
which the project of thinking this totality by escaping it is
which-within existence-is possible only in the direction of infinity or
nothingness; for even if the totality of what I think is imbued with
even if nonmeaning has invaded the totality of the world, up to and
including the very contents of my thought, I still think, I am while I
think. Even if I do not in fact grasp the totality, if I neither understand.1
nor embrace it, I still formulate the project of doing so, and this project.
is meaningful in such a way that it can be defined only in relation to a
precomprehension of the infinite and undetermined totality. This is,
meaningful, which exceeds all that is real, factual, and existent, this
project is rnad, and acknowledges madness as its liberty and its very
possibility. This is why it is not human, in the sense of anthropological
itself in its war with the demon, the evil genius of nonmeaning; by,
pitting itself against the strength of the evil genius, and by resisting
him through reduction of the natural man within itself. In this sen

of beings and determined meanings, the totality of factual history-is
also the extent to which any effort to reduce this project, to enclose it within
a determined historical structure, however comprehensive, risks missing the
essential, risks dulling the point itself Such an effort risks
doing violence to this project in turn (for there is also a violence
applicable to rationalists and to sense, to good sense; and this, perhaps, is
what Foucaun: S book definitely demonstrates, for the victims of whom he
good sense hidden and oppressed by the determined "good sense" of the
always determined too quickly)-risks doing it violence in turn, and a
and the origin of meaning." I use "totalitarian" in the structuralist
beckon each other historically. Structuralist totalttariansim here would
be responsible for an internment of the Cogito similar to the
violences of the classical age. I am not saying that Foucault's book is

historicity

70

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

in general, thereby freeing itself of historicism; I am saying, however, that by
virtue of the construction of his project he sometimes runs the risk of
being totalitarian. Let me clarify: when I refer to the forced entry into
the world of that which is not there and is supposed by the world, or when
I state that the compelle intrare (epigraph of the chapter on "the great
internment") becomes violence itself when it turns toward the hyperbole in
order to make hyperbole reenter the world, or when I say that this
reduction to intraworldliness is the origin and very meaning of what is
called violence, making possible all straitjackets, I am not invoking an
other world, an alibi or an evasive transcendence. That would be yet another
possibility of violence, a possibility that is, moreover, often the
accomplice of the first one.
I think, therefore, that (in Descartes) everything can be reduced to a
determined historical totality except the hyperbolical project. Now, this
project belongs to the narration narrating itself and not to the narration

narrated by Foucault. It cannot be recounted, cannot be objectified as,
I am sure that within the movement which is called the Cartesian
Cogito this hyperbolical extremity is not the only element that should
be, like pure madness in general, silent. As soon as Descartes has
Cogito through God, to identify the act of the Cogito with a reasonable
reason And he does so as soon as he proffers and reflects the Cogito. That is
. to say, he must temporalize the Cogito, which itself is valid only during
at the point, the sharpest point, of the instant. And here one should be
ralization. For if the Cogito is valid even for the maddest madman, one
must, in fact, not be mad if one is to reflect it and retain it, if one is to
communicate it and its meaning. And here, with the reference to G
and to a certain memory,27 would begin the hurried repatriation of
mad and hyperbolical wanderings which now take shelter and
given reassurance within the order of reasons, in order once more
take possession of the truths they had left behind. Within Descartes
text, at least, the internment takes place at this point. It is here
hyperbolical and mad wanderings once more become itinerary

world, which is given to us by God as terra firma. For, finally, it is God
alone who, by permitting me to extirpate myself from a Cogito that at
its proper moment can always remain a silent madness, also insures my
representations and my cognitive determinations, that is, my discourse
against madness. It is without doubt that, for Descartes, God alone 28
protects me against the madness to which the Cogito, left to its own
ea
authority'sr, could only open itself up in the most hospitable way. And
ding seems to me powerful and illuminating not at the
Foucault
stage of the text which he cites, which is anterior and secondary to the
Cogito, but from the moment which immediately succeeds the instantaneous experience of the Cogito at its most intense, when reason and
madness have not yet been separated, when to take the part of the
Cogito is neither to take the part of reason as reasonable order, nor the part
of disorder and madness, but is rather to grasp, once more, the source
mnatngrom the moment
when the Cogito must reflect and proffer itself in an organized philosophical discourse. That is, almost always. For if the Cogito is valid even for
the madman, to be mad-if once more, this expression has a singular

say so. And in any event, Foucault is right in the extent to which the
project of constraining any wandering already animated a doubt which was
always proposed as methodical. This identification of the Cogito with
reasonable-normal-reason need not even await-in fact, if not in
principle-the proofs of the existence of a veracious God as the
supreme protective barrier against madness. This identification intervenes
from the moment when Descartes determines natural light (which in its
undetermined source should be valid even for the mad), from the
moment when he pulls himself out of madness by determining natural
light through a series of principles and axioms (axiom of causality
according to which there must be at least as much reality in the cause as in
the effect; then, after this axiom permits the proof of the existence of God,
the axioms that "the light of nature teaches us that fraud and
deception necessarily proceed from some defect")." These dogmatic
ally determined axioms escape doubt, are never even submitted to its
scrutiny, are established only reciprocally, on the basis of the existence
and truthfulness of God. Due to this fact, they fall within the province
of the history of knowledge and the determined structures of phil
osophy. This is why the act of the Cogito, at the hyperbolical moment
when it pits itself against madness, or rather lets itself be pitted against
madness, must be repeated and distinguished from the language or

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS 73
within the chain of reasons. But it is our belief that this movement can be
described within its own time and place only if one has previously
disengaged the extremity of hyperbole, which Foucault seemingly has not
done. In the fugitive and, by its essence, ungraspable moment when it
still escapes the linear order of reasons, the order of reason in general and
the determinations of natural light, does not the Cartesian Cogito lend
itself to repetition, up to a certain point, by the Husserlian Cogito and by
the critique of Descartes implied in it?
This would be an example only, for some day the dogmatic and
historically determined grounds-ours-will be discovered, which the critique
of Cartesian deductivism, the impetus and madness of the Husserlian
reduction of the totality of the world, first had to rest on, and then had to
fall onto in order to be stated. One could do for Husserl what Foucault has
done for Descartes: demonstrate how the neturalization of the factual
world is a neutralization (in the sense in which to neutralize is also to
master, to reduce, to leave free in a straitjacket) of nonmeaning, the most
subtle form of an act of force. And in truth, Husserl increasingly
associated the theme of normality with the theme

of the transcendental reduction. The embedding of transcendental

the deductive system in which Descartes must inscribe it as soon as he
proposes it for apprehension and communication, that is, as soon as he
reflects the Cogito for the other, which means for oneself It is through
this relationship to the other as an other self that meaning reassures
reassurance given against the anguish of being mad at the point of
greatest proximity to madness. This silent and specific moment could'
be called pathetic. As for the functioning of the hyperbole in the struc
ture of Descartes's discourse and in the order of reasons, our reading is
therefore, despite all appearances to the contrary, profoundly aligned
with Foucault's. It is indeed Descartes-and everything for which this'
name serves as an index-it is indeed the system of certainty that first
of all functions in order to inspect, master, and limit hyperbole, and
does so both by determining it in the ether of a natural light whose
axioms are from the outset exempt from hyperbolical doubt, and by
making of hyperbolical doubt a point of transition firmly maintained

phenomenology in the metaphysics of presence, the entire Husserlian
thematic of the living present is the profound reassurance of the certainty of
meaning.
By separating, within the Cogito, on the one hand, hyperbole (which I
maintain cannot be enclosed in a factual and determined historical
structure, for it is the project of exceeding every finite and determined
totality), and, on the other hand, that in Descartes's philosophy (or in the
philosophy supporting the Augustinian Cogito or the Husserlian
Cogito as well) which belongs to a factual historical structure, I am not
proposing the separation of the wheat from the tares in every philosophy in the name of some philosophia perennis. Indeed, it is exactly the
contrary that I am proposing. In question is a w a y of accounting for the
ery historicity of philosophy. I believe that historicity in general
the latter would be impossible if we possessed only hyperbole, on the one
hand, or, on the other, only determined historical structures, finite
Wdtanschauungen. The historicity proper to philosophy is located and
constituted in the transition, the dialogue between hyperbole and the

finite structure, between that which exceeds the totality and the closed
totality, in the difference between history and historicity; that is, in the place
where, or rather at the moment when, the Cogito and all that it symbolizes
here (madness, derangement, hyperbole, etc.) pronounce and reassure
themselves then to fall, necessarily forgetting themselves until their reactivation,
their reawakening in another statement of the excess which also later will
become another decline and another crisis. From its very first breath, speech,
confined to this temporal rhythm of crisis and reawakening, is able to open
the space for discourse only by emprisoning madness. This rhythm,
moreover, is not an alternation that additionally would be temporal. It is
rather the movement of temporalization itself as concerns that which unites it
to the movement of logos. But this violent liberation of speech is possible
and can be pursued only in the extent to which it keeps itself resolutely
and consciously at the greatest possible proximity to the abuse that is the usage
of speech-just close enough to say violence, to dialogue with itself as
irreducible violence, and just far enough to live and live as speech. Due
to this, crisis or oblivion perhaps is not an accident, but rather the destiny
of speaking philosophy-the philosophy which lives only by emprisoning
madness, but which would die as thought, and by a still worse violence, if a
new speech did not at every instant liberate previous madness while
enclosing within itself, in its present existence, the madman of the day. It is
only by virtue of this oppression of madness that finite-thought, that is to
say, history, can reign. Extending this truth to historicity in general, without
keeping to a determined historical moment, one could say that the reign of
finite thought can be established only on the basis of the more or less
disguised internment, humiliation, fettering and mockery of the madman
within us, of the madman who can only be the fool of a logos which is
father, master, and king. But that is another discourse and another story. I
will conclude by citing Foucault once more. Long after the passage on
Descartes, some three hundred pages later, introducing Rameau's Nephew
Foucault writes, with a sigh of remorse: "In doubt's confrontation with its
major dangers, Descartes realized that he could not be mad-though he was to
acknowledge for a long time to come that all the powers of,;, unreason kept
vigil around his thought."" What we have attempted to do here this evening
is to situate ourselves within the interval of this

COGITO AND THE HISTORY OF MADNESS

remorse, Foucault's remorse, Descartes's remorse according to Foucault;
and within the space of stating that, "though he was to acknowledge
for a long time to come," we have attempted not to extinguish the other
light, a black and hardly natural light, the vigil of the "powers of unreason"
around the Cogito. We have attempted to requite ourselves toward the
gesture which Descartes uses to requite himself as concerns the menacing
powers of madness which are the adverse origin of philosophy.
Among all Foucault's claims to my gratitude, there is thus also that of
having made me better anticipate, more so by his monumental book
than by the naive reading of the Meditations, to what degree the philosophical
act can no longer no longer be in memory of Cartesianism, if to be
Cartesian, as Descartes himself doubtless understood it, is to attempt to
be Cartesian. That is to say, as I have at least tried to demonstrate, toattempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole from whose heights thought is
announced to itself, frightens itself, and reassures itself against being
annihilated or wrecked in madness or in death. At its height hyperbole, the
absolute opening, the uneconomic expenditure, is always reembraced by
an economy and is overcome by economy. The relationship between reason,
madness, and death is an economy, a structure of deferral whose irreducible
originality must be respected. This attemptto-say-the-demonic-hyperbole is
not an attempt among others; it is not an attempt which would occasionally
and eventually be completed by the saying of it, or by its object, the direct
object of a willful subjectivity. This attempt to say, which is not,,
moreover, the antagonist of silence, but rather the condition for it, is the
original profoundity of will in general. Nothing, further, would be more
incapable of regrasping this will than voluntarism, for, as finitude and
as history, this attempt is also a first passion. It keeps within itself the
trace of a violence. It is more written than said, it is economized. The
economy of this writing is a regulated relationship between that which
exceeds and the exceeded totality: the differance of the absolute excess.
To define philosophy as the attempt-to-say-the-hyperbole is to
confess-and philosophy is perhaps this gigantic confession-that by
virtue of the historical enunciation through which philosophy tranquilizes itself and excludes madness, philosophy also betrays itself (or
betrays itself as thought), enters into a crisis and a forgetting of itself

75

that are an essential and necessary period of its movement. I philosophize only in terror, but in the confessed terror of going mad. The
confession is simultaneously, at its present moment, oblivion and unveiling,
protection and exposure: economy.
But this crisis in which reason is madder than madness-for reason is
nonmeaning and oblivion-and in which madness is more rational than
reason, for it is closer to the wellspring of sense, however silent or
murmuring-this crisis has always begun and is interminable. It suffices to
say that, if it is classic, it is not so in the sense of the classical age but in the sense of
eternal and essential classicism, and is also historical in an unexpected
sense.
And nowhere else and never before has the concept of crisis been able to
enrich and reassemble all its potentialities, all the energy of its
meaning, as much, perhaps, as in Michel Foucault's book. Here, the
crisis is on the one hand, in Husserl's sense, the danger menacing
reason and meaning under the rubric of objectivism, of the forgetting of
origins, of the blanketing of origins by the rationalist and transcendental
unveiling itself Danger as the movement of reason menaced by its own
security, etc.
But the crisis is also decision, the caesura of which Foucault speaks, in
the sense of krinein, the choice and division between the two ways
separated by Parmenides in his poem, the way of logos and the nonway,
the labyrinth, the palintrope in which logos is lost; the way of meaning
and the way of nonmeaning; of Being and of non-Being. A division on
whose basis, after which, logos, in the necessary violence of its irruption,
is separated from itself as madness, is exiled from itself, forgetting its origin
and its own possibility. Is not what is called finitude possibility as crisis?
A certain identity between the consciousness of crisis and the forgetting of
it? Of the thinking of negativity and the reduction of negativity?
Crisis of reason, finally, access to reason and attack of reason. For
what Michel Foucault teaches us to think is that there are crises of
reason in strange complicity with what the world calls crises of
madness.

meaning in on itself Humor and games, laughter and dances, songs,
circled graciously around a discourse which, as it did not yet love its
true root, bent a bit in the wind. Did not yet stand upright in order to
enunciate only the rigor and rigidity of poetic obligation.
In Le livre des questions' the voice has not been altered, nor the intention
abandoned, but the accent is more serious. A powerful and ancient root is
exhumed, and on it is laid bare an ageless wound (for what Jabes
teaches us is that roots speak, that words want to grow, and that poetic
discourse takes root in a wound): in question is a certain Judaism as the
birth and passion of writing. The passion of writing, the love and
endurance of the letter itself whose subject is not decidably the Jew or the

event, the incommensurable destiny which grafts the history of a

onto the radical origin of meaning as literality, that is, onto historicity
itself. For there could be no history without the gravity and labor of
literality, The painful folding of itself which permits history to reflect itself
as it ciphers itself. This reflection is its beginning. The only thing that begins
by reflecting itself is history. And this fold, this furrow, is the Jew. The Jew

for truth's thorough suffusion with historicity and for history's assignment of
itself to its empiricity.
difficulty of being a Jew, which coincides with the difficulty of writing; for Judaism
and writing are but the same waiting, the same hope, the same

depletion.

(ibid., p. 132)

In question is a labor, a deliverance, a slow gestation of the poet by the
poem whose father he is.
Little by little the book will finish me.
(L'espace blanc)

The poet is thus indeed the subject of the book, its substance and its
master, its servant and its theme. And the book is indeed the subject of the
poet, the speaking and knowing being who in the book writes on the
book. This movement through which the book, articulated by the voice of
the poet, is folded and bound to itself, the movement through which the
book becomes a subject in itself and for itself, is not critical or speculative
reflection, but is, first of all, poetry and history. For in its representation of
itself the subject is shattered and opened. Writing is itself written, but also
ruined, made into an abyss, in its own representation. Thus, within this
book, which infinitely reflects itself and which develops as a painful
questioning of its own possibility, the form of the
book represents itself:

The exchange between the Jew and writing as a pure and founding
exchange, an exchange without prerogatives in which the original
appeal is, in another sense of the word, a convocation-this is the most
persistent affirmation of the Livre des questions:
You are he who writes and is written.
And Reb Ilde: "What difference is there between choosing and being; chosen when
we can do nothing but submit to the choice?"

(ibid., p. 30)

The novel of Sarah and Yukel, through various dialogues and meditations
attributed to imaginary rabbis, is the story of a love destroyed by men and by
words. It has the dimensions of a book and the bitter obstinacy of a
wandering question.
(Livre des questions, p. 26)

And through a kind of silent displacement toward the essential which
makes of this book one long metonymy, the situation of the Jew becomes
exemplary of the situation of the poet, the man of speech and of writing.
The poet, in the very experience of his freedom, find{ himself both
bound to language and delivered from it by a speech whose master,
nonetheless, he himself is.

We will see that by another direction of metonymy-but to what
extent is it other?-the Livre des questions describes the generation of God
himself. The wisdom of the poet thus culminates its freedom in the
passion of translating obedience to the law of the word into autonomy.
'Without which, and if passion becomes subjection, the poet is mad.
The madman is the victim of the rebellion of words.

Words choose the poet....

The art of the writer consists in little by little making words interest theme:

Also, through his understanding of this assignment of the root, and

assumes that the poet does not simply receive his speech and his law
from God. Judaic heteronomy has no need of a poet's intercession.
Poetry is to prophecy what the idol is to truth. It is perhaps for this
reason that in Jabes the poet and the Jew seem at once so united and
disunited, and that the entire Livre des questions is also a self-justification
addressed to the Jewish community which lives under heteronomy and
to which the poet does not truly belong. Poetic autonomy, comparable to
none other, presupposes broken Tables.
And Reb Lima: Freedom, at first, was engraved ten times in the Tables of
the Law, but we deserve it so little that the Prophet broke them in his
anger.

(Ibid., P. 124)
Between the fragments of the broken Tables the poem grows and the
right to speech takes root. Once more begins the adventure of
the text as weed, as outlaw far from "the fatherland of the Jews," which
is a "sacred text surrounded by commentaries" (p. 109). The necessity of
commentary, like poetic necessity, is the very form of exiled speech.
In the beginning is hermeneutics. But the shared necessity of exegesis,
.the interpretive imperative, is interpreted differently by the rabbi
and the poet. The difference between the horizon of the original text
and exegetic writing makes the difference between the rabbi
and the poet irreducible. Forever unable to reunite with each other, yet
so close to each other, how could they ever regain the realm? The original
opening of interpretation essentially signifies that there will
always be rabbis and poets. And two interpretations of interpret

Do not forget that you are the nucleus of a rupture.

(Ibid., P. 137)
God separated himself from himself in order to let us speak, in
order to astonish and to interrogate us. He did so not by speaking but by
keeping still, by letting silence interrupt his voice and his signs, by
letting the Tables be broken. In Exodus God repented and said so at least
twice, before the first and before the new Tables, between o n
girial speech and writing and, within Scripture, between the origin
and repetition (Exodus 32:14; 33:17). Writing is, thus, originally
hermetic and secondary. Our writing, certainly, but already His, which
starts with the stifling of his voice and the dissimulation of his Face.
This difference, this negativity in God is our freedom, the transcendence and the verb which can relocate the purity of their negative
origin only in the possibility of the Question. The question of "the
irony of God," of which Schelling spoke, is first, as always, turned in
on itself
God is in perpetual revolt against God.
(Livre des questions, P. 177)

God is an interrogation of God.

(ibid., p. 152)
Kafka said: "We are nihilist thoughts in the brain of God." If God
opens the question in God, if he is the very opening of the Question,
there can be no simplicity of God. And, thus, that which was unthinkable for
the classical rationalists here becomes the obvious itself. Proceeding within
the duplicity of his own questionability, God does not act in the simplest
ways; he is not truthful, he is not sincere. Sincerity, which is simplicity,
is a lying virtue. It is necessary, on the contrary, to accede to
the virtue of the lie.
"Reb Jacob, who was my first master, believed in the virtue of the lie, because,
he said, there is no writing without a lie and writing is the way of God".
(P . 92):;

The clumsy, equivocal way of the detour, borrowed by God from God.
Irony of God, ruse of God, the oblique way, born of God, the path
toward God of which man is not a simple detour. The infinite detour.
Way of God. "Yukel, speak to us of the man who is a lie in God" (p. 94).
This way, preceded by no truth, and thus lacking the prescription of
truth's rigor, is the way through the Desert. Writing is the moment of
the desert as the moment of Separation. As their name indicates-in
Aramaic-the Pharisees, those misunderstood men of literality, were
also "separated ones." God no longer speaks to us; he has interrupted
himself: we must take words upon ourselves. We must be separated
from life and communities, and must entrust ourselves to traces, must
become men of vision because we have ceased hearing the voice from
within the immediate proximity of the garden. "Sarah, Sarah with what does
the world begin?-With speech?-With vision?" (p. 173). Writing is displaced on
the broken line between lost and promised speech. The difference
between speech and writing is sin, the anger of God emerging from
itself, lost immediacy, work outside the garden. "The garden is speech, the
desert writing. In each grain of sand a sign surprises" (p. 169). The Judaic
experience as reflection, as separation of life and thought, signifies the
crossing of the book as an infinite anchoritism placed between two
immediacies and two self-identifications. "Yokel, how many pages to live, how
many to die, separate you from yourself, separate you from the book to the abandoning of the
book?" (p. 44). The desert-book is made of sand, "of mad sand," of infinite,
innumerable and vain sand. "Pick up a little sand, wrote Reb Ivri ... then you will
know the vanity of the verb" (p. 122).
The Jewish consciousness is indeed the unhappy consciousness, and Le
livre des questions is its poem; is the poem inscribed just beyond the
phenomenology of the mind, which the Jew can accompany only for a
short while, without eschatological provision, in order not to limit his
desert, close his book and cauterize his cry.' "Mark the first page of a book
with aredribbon,forthewoundisinscribed atitsbeginning.Reb Alce" (p. 122).
If absence is the heart of the question, if separation can emerge only
the rupture of God-with God-if the infinite distance of the Other is
respected only within the sands of a book in which wandering and
mirages are always possible, then Le livre des questions is simultaneously
the interminable song of absence and a book on the book. Absence

it knows itself as disappearing and lost, and to this extent it remains
inaccessible and impenetrable. To gain access to it is to lose it; to show it is
to hide it; to acknowledge it is to lie. "Nothing is our principle concern, said Reb

page ..." And Le livre des questions resolutely keeps itself on the vague estate, in
the non-place, between city and desert, for in either the root is equally
rejected or sterilized. Nothing flourishes in sand or between
cobblestones, if not words. City and desert, which are neither countries,
nor countrysides, nor gardens, besiege the poetry of Jabes and ensure that
it will have a necessarily infinite echo, City and desert simultaneously,

only in order to provide its passageway, to be the diaphanous element

once everything and nothing. Like God:

gives me existence by naming me. It is thus simultaneously true that
things come into existence and lose existence by being named. Sacrifice
of existence to the word, as Hegel said, but also the consecration of
existence by the word. Moreover, it does not suffice to be written, for
one must write in order to have a name. One must be called something.
Which supposes that "My name is a question ... Reb Eglal" (p. 125). "Without my

This necessary exchange of one's existence with or for the letterwhich is either to lose or to gain existence-is also imposed upon God:
I did not seek you Sarah. I sought you. Through you, I ascend to the origin of the

language. To allege that one reduces this lapse through narration,
philosophical discourse, or the order of reasons or deduction, is to
misconstrue language, to misconstrue that language is the rupture with totality
itself. The fragment is neither a determined style nor a failure, but the
form of that which is written. Unless God himself writes-and he would
still have to be the God of the classical philosophers who neither
interrupted nor interrogated himself, did not stifle himself, as did the God
of Jabes. (But the God of the classical philosophers, whose actual infinity
did not tolerate the question, precisely had no vital need for writing.) As
opposed to Being and to the Leibnizian Book,' the rationality of the
Logos, for which our writing is responsible, obeys the principle of
discontinuity. The caesura does not simply finish and fix meaning: "The
aphorism," says Nietzsche, "the sentence, in which I, as the first among the
Germans, am a master, are the forms of eternity." But, primarily, the
caesura makes meaning emerge. It does not do so alone, of course; but
without interruption-between letters, words, sentences, books-no
signification could be awakened. Assuming that Nature refuses the leap, one
can understand why Scripture will never be Nature. It proceeds by leaps
alone. Which makes it perilous. Death strolls between letters. To write,
what is called writing, assumes an access to the mind through having the
courage to lose one's life, to die away from nature.

writing's inability to "help itself' (Phaedrus). Is not the divine-the `
disappearance of man-announced in this distress of writing?
If absence does not allow itself to be reduced by the letter, this is so
because it is the letter's ether and respiration. The letter is the separation and limit in which meaning is liberated from its emprisonment in
aphoristic solitude. No "logic," no proliferation of conjunctive
undergrowth can reach the end of its essential discontinuity and non-"
contemporaneousness, the ingenuity of its under-stood [sous-entendu]'
silences. The other originally collaborates with meaning. There is an
essential lapse between significations which is not the simple and
tive fraudulence of a word, nor even the nocturnal memory of all

to signify, but it is also, in language's twisting of itself, what letters say:
being enclosed in letters' net.
Absence, finally as the breath of the letter, for the letter lives. "The
name must germinate, otherwise it is false," says Andre Breton. Signifying
absence or separation, the letter lives as aphorism. It is solitude,

articulates solitude, and lives on solitude. It would no longer be the
letter of the law if it were outside difference, or if it left its solitude, or
put an end to interruption, to distance, to respect, and to its relation to
the other, that is, a certain nonrelation. There is, thus, an animality of
the letter which assumes the forms of the letter's desire, anxiety, and
solitude.

inert literality, that is to say, of nature, or of speech returned to

takes it further than peaceful and sedentary certitude.

Betrayed by citation, the organized power of the song keeps itself
beyond the reach of commentary, in the Livre des questions. Here in particular,
is it not born of an extraordinary confluence that weighs upon
the canceling lines of words, the punctual singularity of Edmond
Jabes's experience, his voice, his style? A confluence in which is
recalled, conjoined, and condensed the suffering, the millennial reflection
of a people, the "pain" "whose past and continuity coincide with those of
writing," the destiny that summons the Jew, placing him between the
voice and the cipher; and he weeps for the lost voice with tears as black

any means, through all routes, and to claim responsibility for it against a
Father of Logos. One reads, for example, in Le livre de l'absent: "A decisive
battle in which the vanquished, betrayed by their wounds, describe, as they
fall to the ground, a page of writing dedicated by the victors to the
chosen one who unwittingly set off the battle. In fact, it is in order to
affirm the supremacy of the verb over man, of the verb over the verb,
that the battle took place" (Livre de I'absent, p. 69). Is this confluence Le livre des
questions?
No. The song would no longer be sung if its tension was only
confluential. Confluence must repeat the origin. This cry sings because in its
enigma, it brings forth water from a cleft rock, the unique source, the unity
of a spurting rupture. After which come "currents," "affluents,"
"influences." A poem always runs the risk of being meaningless, and
would be nothing without this risk of being meaningless, and would be
nothing without this risk. If Jabes's poem is to risk having a meaning, or
if his question, at least, is to risk having a meaning, the source must be
presumed; and it must be presumed that the unity of the source is not
due to a chance encounter, but that beneath this encounter another
encounter takes place today. A first encounter, an encounter above all
unique because it was a separation, like the separ
ation of Sarah and Yukel. Encounter is separation. Such a proposition,
which contradicts "logic," breaks the unity of Being-which resides in
the fragile link of the "is"-by welcoming the other and difference into
the source of meaning. But, it will be said, Being must always already be
conceptualized in order to say these things-the encounter and the
separation of what and of whom-and especially in order to say that

EDMOND JABES AND THE QUESTION OF THE BOOK 91

If, in the process of adding pitiful graffiti to an immense poem, as
we are doing here, one insisted upon reducing the poem to its "thematic structure," as it is called, one would have to acknowledge that
nothing within it is original. The well-worn themes of the question
within God, of negativity within God as the liberation of historicity and
human speech, of man's writing as the desire and question of God (and the
double genitive is ontological before being grammatical, or rather is the
embedding of the ontological and the grammatical within the graphein),h1 of
history and discourse as the anger of God emerging himself, etc., etc.these themes are not first proper to Bohme, to German romanticism, to
Hegel, to the final Scheler, etc., etc. Negativity in God, exile as writing, the
life of the letter are all already in the Cabala. Which means "Tradition" itself
And Jabes is conscious of the Cabalistic resonances of his book. He even
plays on them, occasionally (ci, for example, Le livre de l'absent, p. 12).
But traditionality is not orthodoxy. Others, perhaps, will articulate the
ways in which Jabes also severs himself from the Jewish community,
assuming that this last notion here has a sense, or has its classical sense. He
does not sever himself from it only insofar as concerns dogma, but more
profoundly still. For Jabes, who acknowledges a very late discovery of a
certain way of being part of Judaism, the Jew is but the suffering allegory:
"You are all Jews, even the antisemites, for you have all been designated for martyrdom"
(Livre des questions, p. 180). He must justify himself to his blood brothers and to
rabbis who are no longer imaginary. They will all reproach him for this
universalism, this essentialism, this
eletal allegorism, this neutralization of the event in the realms of the
symbolic and the imaginary.
Addressing themselves to me, m y blood brothers said: "You are not Jewish. You do
not come to the synagogue." .. .
(Livre des questions, p. 63)
The rabbis whose words you cite are charlatans. Have they ever existed? And
you have nourished yourself on their impious words....
You are Jewish for the others and so little Jewish for us.

encounter is separation. Certainly, but "must always already" precisely;
signifies the original exile from the kingdom of Being, signifies exile as
the conceptualization of Being, and signifies that Being never is, never
shows itself, is never present, Is never now, outside difference (in all the,
senses today required by this word)." Whether he is Being or the
master of beings, God himself is, and appears as what he is, within
difference, that is to say, as difference and within dissimulation.

Addressing himself to me, the most contemplative ofm y blood brothers said:

92 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

"To make no dffierence between a Jew and him who is not Jewish, is this
not already to cease being a Jew?" And they added: "Brotherhood is to give,
give, give, and you will never be able to give what you are." Striking my
chest with my fist I thought: "I am nothing. I have a severed head. But is
not a man worth a man? And a decapitated one worth a
believer?"

Jabes is not a defendant in this dialogue, for he carries both it and
the charges within him. In this noncoincidence of the self and the self,
he is more and less Jewish than the Jew. But the Jew's identification
with himself does not exist. The Jew is split, and split first of all
between the two dimensions of the letter: allegory and literality. His
history would be but one empirical history among others if he established or nationalized himself within difference and literality. He would
have no history at all if he let himself be attenuated within the algebra
of an abstract universalism.
Between the too warm flesh of the literal event and the cold skin of
the concept runs meaning. This is how it enters into the book. Everything enters into, transpires in the book. This is why the book is never
finite. It always remains suffering and vigilant.
-A lamp is on my table and the house is in the book.

Where is the book found?
-In the book.

E D M ON D JABS AND THE QUESTION OF THE BOOK

the other is also to negate oneself, and meaning is alienated from itself
in the transition of writing. Intention surpasses itself and disengages
from itself in order to be said. "I hate that which is pronounced in which already I am no
longer" (p. 17). Just as the end of writing passes beyond writing, its origin is
not yet in the book. The writer, builder, and guardian of the book posts
himself at the entrance to the house. The writer is a ferryman and his
destination always has a liminal signification. "Who are you?-The
guardian of the house.-. . . Are you in the book?-My place is on the threshhold"
(p. 15).
But-and this is the heart of the matter-everything that is exterior in
relation to the book, everything that is negative as concerns the book, is
produced within the book. The exit from the book, the other and the
threshhold, are all articulated within the book. The other and the threshhold can only be written, can only affirm themselves in writing. One
emerges from the book only within the book, because, for Jabes, the
book is not in the world, but the world is in the book.
"The world exists because the book exists." "The book is the work of the book" "The
book multiplies the book" (p. 33). To be is to-be-in-the-book, even if Being is
not the created nature often called the Book of God during the Middle
Ages. "If God is, it is because He is in the book" (p. 32). Jabes knows that the book is
possessed and threatened, that "its response is still a question, that its dwelling
is ceaselessly threatened" (p. 32). But the book can only be threatened by
nothing, non-Being, nonmeaning. If it came to be, the threat-as is the case
here-would be avowed, pronounced, domesticated. It would be of the
house and of the book.
All historic anxiety, all poetic anxiety, all Judaic anxiety thus torments this poem of the interminable question. All affirmations and all
negations, all contradictory questions are welcomed into the question
within the unity of the book, in a logic like none other, in Logic. Here we
would have to say Grammar. But does not this anxiety and this war, this
unloosening of all the waters, rest upon the peaceful and silent basis of
a nonquestion? Is not the writing of the question, by its deci
ion, by its resolution, the beginning of repose and response? The first
violence as regards the question? The first crisis and the first forgetting,

Every exit from the book is made within the book. Indeed, the end of
writing keeps itself beyond writing: "Writing that culminates in itself is only a
manifestation of spite." If writing is not a tearing of the self toward the',,
other within a confession of infinite separation, if it is a delectation of
artist, then it destroys itself. It syncopates itself in the roundness I
of the egg and the plenitude of the Identical. It is true that to go toward

the necessary beginning of wandering as history, that is to say, the very
dissimulation of wandering?
The nonquestion of which we are speaking is not yet a dogma; and

93

94

WRITING AND DIFFE R E NC E

the act of faith in the book can precede, as we know, belief in the Bible.
And can also survive it. The nonquestion of which we are speaking is
the unpenetrated certainty that Being is a Grammar; and that the world is
in all its parts a cryptogram to be constituted or reconstituted
through poetic inscription or deciphering; that the book is original, that
everything belongs to the book before being and in order to come into the world;
that any thing can be born only by approaching the book, can die only by
failing in sight of the book; and that always the impassible shore of the
book is first.
But what if the Book was only, in all senses of the word, an
epoch of Being (an epoch coming to an end which would permit us to see
Being in the glow of its agony or the relaxation of its grasp, and an end
which would multiply, like a final illness, like the garrulous and
tenacious hypermnesia of certain moribunds, books about the dead book)?
If the form of the book was no longer to be the model of meaning? If
Being was radically outside the book, outside its letter? And was such
by virtue of a transcendence which could no longer be touched by
inscription and signification, a transcendence which would no longer
lie on the page, and which above all would have arisen before it? If
Being lost itself in books? If books were the dissipation of Being? If the
Being of the world, its presence and the meaning of its Being, revealed
itself only in illegibility, in a radical illegibility which would not be the
accomplice of a lost or sought after legibility, of a page not yet cut from
Jaspers's expression, "the manuscript of another," but primarily the;`
other of every possible manuscript? And if it were always too soon to say
"revolt is o page crumpled in the waste basket" (p. 177)? And always too soon
to say that evil is only indecipherable, due to the effect of some lapsus calami' or of
God's cacography, and that "our life, within Evil, has the form of an`
And if Death did not let itself be inscribed in the book in which, as is

something other in any event, than the dead letter of the law which

book, the age of grammar, the age of everything announced under

EDMOND JABE`S AND THE QUESTION OF THE BOOK

the heading of the meaning of Being? The dissimulation of a still
illegible writing?
The radical illegibility of which we are speaking is not irrationality, is
not despair provoking non-sense, is not everything within the domains
of the incomprehensible and the illogical that is anguishing. Such an
interpretation-or determination-of the illegible already belongs to the
book, is enveloped within the possibility of the volume. Original
illegibility is not simply a moment interior to the book, to reason or to
logos; nor is it any more their opposite, having no relationship of
symmetry to them, being incommensurable with them. Prior to the
book (in the nonchronological sense), original illegibility is therefore the
very possibility of the book and, within it, of the ulterior and eventual
opposition of "rationalism" and "irrationalism." The Being that is
announced within the illegible is beyond these categories, beyond, as it
writes itself, its own name.
It would be ludicrous to impugn Jabes for not having pronounced
these questions in Le livre des questions. They can only sleep within the
literary act which needs both their life and their lethargy. Writing
would die of the pure vigilance of the question, as it would of the
simple erasure of the question. Is not to write, once more, to confuse
ontology and grammar? The grammar in which are inscribed all the
dislocations of dead syntax, all the aggressions perpetrated by speech
against language, every questioning of the letter itself? The written
questions addressed to literature, all the tortures inflicted upon it, are
always transfigured, drained, forgotten by literature, within literature;
having become modifications of itself, by itself, in itself, they are mortifications, that is to say, as always, ruses of life. Life negates itself in
literature only so that it may survive better. So that it may be better. It

does not negate itself any more than it affirms itself: it differs from
itself, defers itself, and writes itself as differance. Books are always books of
life (the archetype would be the Book of Life kept by the God of the Jews)
or of afterlife (the archetype would be the Books of the Dead kept
radical interrogation, that is to say, finally, is man capable of literature?"
one could just as well say, on the basis of a certain conceptualization of life,
"incapable" half the time. Except if one admits that pure literature
is nonliterature, or death itself The question about the origin of the

book, the absolute interrogation, the interrogation of all possible interrogations, the "interrogation of God" will never belong to a book.
Unless the question forgets itself within the articulations of its memory,
the time of its interrogation, the time and tradition of its sentence, and
unless the memory of itself, the syntax binding the question to itself,
does not make a disguised affirmation of this origin. Already a book of
the question becoming remote from its origin.
Henceforth, so that God may indeed be, as Jabes says, an interrogation of God,
would we not have to transform a final affirmation into a question?
Literature would then, perhaps, only be the dreamlike displacement of
this question:
"There is the book of God in which God questions himself, and there is the

book of m a n which is proportionate to that of God."

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS
An essay on the thought of
Emmanuel Levinas'

Hebraism and Hellenism,-between these two points of influence
moves our world. At one time it feels more powerfully the
attraction of one of them, at another time of the other; and it
ought to be, though it never is, evenly and happily balanced
between them.
(Matthew Arnold, Culture and Anarchy)
That philosophy died yesterday, since Hegel or Marx, Nietzsche, Or
Heidegger-and philosophy should still wander toward the meaning of
its death-or that it has always lived knowing itself to be dying (as is
silently confessed in the shadow of the very discourse which declared
philosophia perennis); that philosophy died one day, within history, or that it
has always fed on its own agony, on the violent way it opens history by
opposing itself to nonphilosophy, which is its past and its concern, its
death and wellspring; that beyond the death, or dying nature, of philosophy, perhaps even because of it, thought still has a future, or even, as
is said today, is still entirely to come because of what philosophy has

98 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

held in store; or, more strangely still, that the future itself has a futureall
these are unanswerable questions. By right of birth, and for one time at least,
these are problems put to philosophy as problems philosophy cannot
resolve.
It may even be that these questions are not philosophical, are not philosophy's
questions. Nevertheless, these should be the only questions today capable of
founding the community, within the world, of those who are still called
philosophers; and called such in remembrance, at very least, of the fact
that these questions must be examined unrelentingly, despite the diaspora of
institutes and languages, despite the publications and techniques that
follow on each other, procreating and accumulating by themselves, like
capital or poverty. A community of the question, therefore, within that
fragile moment when the question is not yet determined enough for the
hypocrisy of an answer to have already initiated itself beneath the mask of
the question, and not yet determined enough for its voice to have been
already and fraudulently articulated within the very syntax of the
question. A community of decision, of initiative, of absolute initiality, but
also a threatened community, in which the question has not yet found
the language it has decided to seek, is not yet sure of its own possibility
within the community. A community of the question about the
possibility of the question. This is very little-almost nothing-but
within it, today, is sheltered and encapsulated an unbreachable dignity
and duty of decision. An unbreathable responsibility. Why unbreachable?
Because the

impossible has already occurred. The impossible according to the totality of
what is questioned, according to the totality of beings, objects and
determinations, the impossible according to the history of facts, has
occurred: there is a history of the question, a pure memory of the pure
question which in its possibility perhaps authorizes all inheritance and all
pure memory in general and as such. The question has already begunwe know it has-and this strange certainty about an other abso

injunction is announced: the question must be maintained. As a question.
The liberty of the question (double genitive)' must be stated and protected. A
founded dwelling, a realized tradition of the question remaining a
question. If this commandment has an ethical meaning, it is not in that it
belongs to the domain of the ethical, but in that it ultimately
authorizes every ethical law in general. There is no stated law, no
commandment, that is not addressed to a freedom of speech. There is
therefore neither law nor commandment which does not confirm and
enclose-that is, does not dissimulate by presupposing itthe possibility of
the question. Thus, the question is always enclosed; it never appears
immediately as such, but only through the hermetism of a proposition in
which the answer has already begun to determine the question. The purity
of the question can only be indicated or recalled through the difference of
a hermeneutical effort.
Thus, those who look into the possibility of philosophy, philosophy's
life and death, are already engaged in, already overtaken by the dialogue
of the question about itself and with itself; they always act in
remembrance of philosophy, as part of the correspondence of the
question with itself Essential to the destiny of this correspondence, then,
is that it comes to speculate, to reflect, and to question about itself within
itself This is where the objectification, secondary interpretation, and
determination of the question's own history in the world all begin; and
this is where the combat embedded in the difference between the
question in general and "philosophy" as a determinedfinite and mortalmoment or mode of the question itself also begins. The difference
between philosophy as a power and adventure of the question itself and
philosophy as a determined event or turning point within this adventure.
This difference is better conceived today. That this difference has
come to light, has been conceptualized as such, is doubtless an
unnoticed and inessential sign for the historian of facts, techniques, and
ideas. But, understood in all its implications, it is perhaps the most
deeply inscribed characteristic of our age. And would not better think

stammer and huddle lazily in the depths of childhood, but precisely the
opposite.
Close to us and since Hegel, in his mighty shadow, the two great
voices which have ordered us to this total repetition-which itself has
recalled us to ourselves and has been acknowledged as of utmost
philosophical urgency-are those of Husserl and Heidegger. Despite the
most profound dissimilarities, the appeal to tradition-which is in no way
traditional-is shaped by an intention common to Husserlian
phenomenology and to what we will call provisionally, by approximation
and for reasons of economy, Heideggerean "ontology."'
Thus, very briefly:

1. The entirety of philosophy is conceived on the basis of its Gree
source. As is well known, this amounts neither to an occidentalisni,
nor to a historicism.' It is simply that the founding concepts of
philosophy are primarily Greek, and it would not be possible to
philosophize, or to speak philosophically, outside this medium. That
Plato, for Husserl, was the founder of a reason and a philosophical
task whose telos was still sleeping in the shadows; or that
for Heidegger, on the contrary, Plato marks the moment at which
the thought of Being forgets itself and is determined as
philosophy-this difference is decisive only at the culmination of a
common root which is Greek. The difference is fraternal in its
posterity, entirely submitted to the same domination. Domination of
the same too, which will disappear neither in phenomenology nor in
"ontology."
2. The archaeology to which Husserl and Heidegger lead us by different paths entails, for both, a subordination or transgression, in any
event a reduction of metaphysics. Even though, for each, this gesture has an
entirely different meaning, or at least does so apparently.
3. Finally, the category of the ethical is not only dissociated from.
metaphysics but coordinated with something other than itself, a
previous and more radical function. When ethics is not treated this

way, when law, the power of resolution, and the relationship to the
other are once more part of the archia, they lose their ethical
specificity.'

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

101

These three motifs arrayed at the unique source of the unique phil
osophy would indicate the only possible direction to be taken by any
philosophical resource in general. Any possible dialogue between
Husserlian phenomenology and Heideggerean "ontology," at every
point where they are more or less directly implicated, can be understood only from within the Greek tradition. At the moment when the
fundamental conceptual system produced by the Greco-European
adventure is in the process of taking over all of humanity, these three motifs
would predetermine the totality of the logos and of the worldwide
historico-philosophical situation. No philosophy could possibly dislodge
them without first succumbing to them, or without finally destroying
itself as a philosophical language. At a historical depth which the
science and philosophies of history can only presuppose, we know that we
are consigned to the security of the Greek element; and
we know it with a knowledge and a confidence which are neither
habitual nor comfortable but, on the contrary, permit us to experience
torment or distress in general. For example, the consciousness of crisis
is for Husserl but the provisional, almost necessary covering up of a
transcendental motif which in Descartes and in Kant was already
beginning to accomplish the Greek aim: philosophy as science. When
Heidegger says that "for a long time, too long, thought has been desiccated," like a fish out of water, the element to which he wishes to
return thought is still-already-the Greek element, the Greek thought
of Being, the thought of Being whose irruption or call produced
Greece. The knowledge and security of which we are speaking are
therefore not in the world: rather, they are the possibility of our
language and the nexus of our world.
It is at this level that the thought of Emmanuel Levinas can make us
tremble.
At the heart of the desert, in the growing wasteland, this thought,
which fundamentally no longer seeks to be a thought of Being
and phenomenality, makes us dream of an inconceivable process of
dismantling and dispossession.
1. In Greek, in our language, in a language rich with all the alluvia of its
history-and our question takes shape already-in a language that
admits to its powers of seduction while playing on them

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

unceasingly, this thought summons us to a dislocation of the Greek
logos, to a dislocation of our identity, and perhaps of identity in
general; it summons us to depart from the Greek site and perhaps
from every site in general, and to move toward what is no longer a
source or a site (too welcoming to the gods), but toward an exhalation, toward a prophetic speech already emitted not only nearer to the
source than Plato or the pre-Socratics, but inside the Greek origin,
close to the other of the Greek (but will the other of the Greek be
the non-Greek? Above all, can it be named the non-Greek? And our
question comes closer.) A thought for which the entirety of the Greek
logos has already erupted, and is now a quiet topsoil deposited not
over bedrock, but around a more ancient volcano. A thought which,
without philology and solely by remaining faithful to the immediate,
but buried nudity of experience itself, seeks to liberate itself from the
Greek domination of the Same and the One (other names for the light
of Being and of the phenomenon) as if from oppression itself-an
oppression certainly comparable to none other in the world, an
ontological or transcendental oppression, but also the origin or alibi
of all oppression in the world. A

thought, finally, which seeks to liberate itself from a philosophy
fascinated by the "visage of being that shows itself in war" which '
"is fixed in the concept of totality which dominates Western
philosophy" (Totality and Infinity [hereafter TI], p. 21).
2. This thought nevertheless seeks to define itself, in its primary possibility, as metaphysical (a Greek notion however, if we follow
vein of our question). A metaphysics that Levinas seeks to raise up
from its subordinate position and whose concept he seeks to
restore in opposition to the entire tradition derived from Aristotle
3. This thought calls upon the ethical relationship-a nonviolentt
relationship to the infinite as infinitely other, to the Other'-as the
only one capable of opening the space of transcendence and of
liberating metaphysics. And does so without supporting ethics'
and metaphysics by anything other than themselves, and without
making them flow into other streams at their source.

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

kind, it reaches a height and a level of penetration in its dialogue at
which the Greeks-and foremost among them the two Greeks named
Husserl and Heidegger-ar e called upon to respond. If the messianic
eschatology from which Levinas draws inspiration seeks neither to
assimilate itself into what is called a philosophical truism, nor even
to "complete" (TI, p. 22) philosophical truisms, nevertheless it is
developed in its discourse neither as a theology, nor as a Jewish
mysticism (it can even be understood as the trial of theology and
mysticism); neither as a dogmatics, nor as a religion, nor as a morality. In
the last analysis it never bases its authority on Hebraic theses or texts. It seeks
to be understood from within a recourse to experience itself. Experience itself and
that which is most irreducible within experience: the passage and departure
toward the other; the other itself as what is most irreducibly other within it:
Others. A recourse not to be confused with what has always been called a
philosophical enterprise, but which reaches a point at which an
exceeded philosophy cannot not be brought into question. Truthfully,
messianic eschatology is never mentioned literally: it is but a question of
designating a space or a hollow within naked experience where this
eschatology can be understood and where it must resonate. This hollow
space is not an opening among others. It is opening itself, the opening of
opening, that which can be enclosed within no category or totality, that
is, everything within experience which can no longer be described by
traditional concepts, and which resists every philosopheme.
What do this explication and this reciprocal surpassing of two origins
and two historical speeches signify? Do a new elan and some strange
community begin to take shape, without being the spiraling return of
Alexandrian promiscuity? If we recall that Heidegger t

which will enclose our perplexity. Faithful also to its history, whose
patience and anxiety capitulate and carry within themselves the
reciprocal interrogation of which we wish to speak.' Then we will
attempt to ask several questions. If they succeed in approaching the
heart of this explication, they will be nothing less than objections, but
rather the questions put to us by Levinas.
We have just spoken of "themes" and of the "history of a thought."
The difficulty is classical and concerns not only method. The brevity of
these pages will only intensify it. We will not choose. We will refuse to
sacrifice the history of Levinas's thought and works to the order or
aggregate of themes-which must not be called a system-assembled
and enriched in the great book Totality and Infinity. And if we must, for once,
have faith in him who stands most accused in the trial conducted by this
book, the result is nothing without its becoming.' But neither will we
sacrifice the self-coherent unity of intention to the becoming, which then
would be no more than pure disorder. We will not choose between the
opening and the totality. Therefore we will be incoherent, but without
systematically resigning ourselves to incoherence. The possibility of the
impossible system will be on the horizon to protect us from empiricism.
Without reflecting here upon the philosophy of this hesitation, let us
note between parentheses that by simply articulating it we have already
come close to Levinas's own problematic.

I THE VIOLENCE OF LIGHT
The departure from Greece was discreetly premeditated in Theorie de
1'intuition dons In phenomenologie de Husserl. In France, in 1930, this was the first
major work devoted to the entirety of Husserl's thought. Through a
remarkable exposition of the developments of phenomenology, such as
were then available from the published works and teachings of the
master, and through precautions which already acknowledged the
"surprises" that Husserl's meditations and unpublished works might
"hold in store," a reticence was announced. The imperialism of theoria
already bothered Levinas. More than any other philosophy, phenomen
ology, in the wake of Plato, was to be struck with light. Unable to reduce
the last naivete, the naivete of the glance, it predetermined Being as
object.' Â°

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

105

At this point, the accusation remains timid and is not of a piece.
(a) First, it is difficult to maintain a philosophical discourse against
light. And thirty years later, when the charges against theoretism
and (Husserlian) phenomenology became the essential motifs in
the break with tradition, the nudity of the face of the other-this
epiphany of a certain non-light before which all violence is to be
quieted and disarmed-will still have to be exposed to a certain
enlightenment. Especially as concerns the violence implicit in
phenomenology.
(b) Next, it is difficult to overlook the fact that Husserl so little pre
determined Being as object that in ideas I absolute existence is
accorded only to pure consciousness. True, it has often been
argued that the difference hardly counts, and that a philosophy of
consciousness is always a philosophy of the object. Levinas's read
ing of Husserl on this point has always been nuanced, supple,
contrasted. As early as in the Theory of Intuition, theory is correctly
distinguished from objectivity in general. As we shall see later,
practical, axiological, etc., consciousness is for Husserl too a
consciousness of the object. Levinas openly acknowledges this.
Therefore, the accusation is really directed against the irreducible
primacy of the subject-object correlation. But, later, Levinas will
insist more and more on those aspects of Husserlian phenomen
ology which take us to the inner or outer reaches of the "subject
object correlation." For example, this would be "intentionality
as a relationship with otherness," as an "exteriority which is
not objective," sensibility, passive genesis, the movement of
temporalization, etc."
(c) Further, for Levinas the sun of the epekeina tes ousias will always

illuminate the pure awakening and inexhaustible source of
thought (TI, p.127). It is not only the Greek ancestor of the infinite
which transcends totality (the totality of being or of noema, the
totality of the same or the ego), 12 but is also the instrument of
destruction for the phenomenology and ontology subjected to the
neutral totality of the Same as Being or as Ego. All the essays in
1947 grouped under the title De l'existence a I'existant will be placed
under the sign of "the Platonic formulation placing the Good

106

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

beyond Being." (In Totality and Infinity the "Phenomenology of Eros"
describes the movement of the epekeina tes ousias in the very experience
of the caress.) In 1947 Levinas calls this movement, which is not
theological, not a transcendence toward "a superior existence,"
"ex-cendence." With a foothold in being, excendence is a "departure
from being and from the categories which describe it." This
ethical excendence designates the site-rather the nonsite-of
metaphysics
as
metatheology,
metaontology,
metaphenomenology. We will have to return to this reading of the
epekeina tes ousias and its relationship to ontology. Since we are
speaking of light, let us note for the moment that the Platonic
movement is interpreted such that it leads no longer to the sun but
even beyond light and Being, beyond the light of Being. "We thus
encounter in our own way the Platonic idea of the Good beyond Being,"
we read at the end of Totality and infinity (p. 293-my italics), concerning
creation and fecundity. In our own way, which is to say that ethical
excendence is not projected toward the neutrality of the good, but
toward the other, and that which (is) epekeina tes ousias is not essen
tially light but fecundity or generosity. Creation is but creation of
the other; it can be only as paternity, and the relations of the father
to son escape all the logical, ontological, and phenomenological
categories in which the absoluteness of the other is necessarily the

same. (But did not the Platonic sun already enlighten the visible
sun, and did not excendence play upon the meta-phor of these
two suns? Was not the Good the necessarily nocturnal source of all
light? The light of light beyond light. The heart of light is black, as
has often been noticed." Further, Plato's sun does not only
enlighten: it engenders. The good is the father of the visible
sun which provides living beings with "creation, growth and
nourishment" Republic, 508a-509b.)
(d) Finally, Levinas is certainly quite attentive to everything in Hus
theoretical consciousness. In a paragraph devoted to nontheoretical
consciousness, it is acknowledged that the primacy of objectivity in
general is not necessarily confused, in Ideas 1, with the primacy of
the theoretical attitude. There are nontheoretical acts and objects
"of' a new and irreducible ontological structure." "For example;

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

107

says Husserl, the act of valorization constitutes an axiological object
Lines (Ge a genstd being specific in relation to the world of things; consti
g from a new region." Levinas also admits on several
occasions that the importance accorded to theoretical objectivity
has to do with the transcendental guide most often chosen in Ideas
I: the perception of extended things. (However, we already know
that this guide could be only a provisional example.)
Despite all these precautions, despite a constant oscillation between
the letter and the spirit of Husserlianism (the former most often con
tested in the name of the latter)," and despite Levinas's insistence
upon what is called a "fluctuation in Husserl's thought," a break not to be
reconsidered is signified. The phenomenological reduction, whose
"historical role ... is not even a problem" for Husserl, remains a prisoner
of the natural attitude which is possible "in the extent to which the
latter is theoretical."" "Husserl gives himself the liberty of theory as he
gives himself theory itself" Chapter 4 of La conscience theorique designates,
within a compressed and nuanced analysis, the point of departure: one
cannot simultaneously maintain the primacy of the objectifying act and
the irreducible originality of nontheoretical consciousness. And if "the
conception of consciousness in the 5th Untersuchung seems to us not only to
affirm a primacy of theoretical consciousness, but sees it as the only access to
what creates the being of
the obj ect" if "the existing woldhi h
,

r, wc is revealed to us, has the

nce, "the real world is the world of knowledge," if "in his [Husserl's]
philosophy ... knowledge and representation 16 is not a mode of life to the
same degree as the others, nor a secondary mode," then "we will have to
take our leave."
One already foresees the unease to which a thought rejecting the
excellence of theoretical rationality will have to resign itself later, especially in
that it never ceases to appeal to the most uprooted rationalism

against theoretism and objectivism. On the contrary, there will be more
force-and danger-in denouncing the blindness of theoretism, its inability to
depart from itself towards absolute exteriority, towards the totally-other,
the infinitely-other "more objective than objectivity" (TI). The
complicity of theoretical objectivity and mystical communion will be
Levinas's true target. The premetaphysical unity of one and the same
violence. An alternation which always modifies the same
confinement of the other.

In 1930 Levinas turns toward Heidegger against Husserl. Sein and Zeit is
published, and Heidegger's teaching begins to spread. Everything which
overflows the commentary and "letter" of Husserl's texts moves toward
"ontology," "in the very special sense Heidegger gives to the term"
(Theorie de !'intuition [hereafter THI]). In his critique of Husserl, Levinas
retains two Heideggerean themes: (1) despite "the idea, so profound,
that in the ontological order the world of science is posterior to the
concrete and vague world of perception, and depends upon it," Husserl
"perhaps was wrong to see in this concrete world, a world of perceived
objects above all" (THI). Heidegger goes further, since for him this world
is not primarily given over to the glance, but is
rather-and we wonder whether Heidegger would have accepted this
formulation-"in its very Being like a center of action, a field of activity or
of solicitude" (ibid.). (2) if Husserl was right in his opposition to
historicism and naturalistic history, he neglected "the historical situanon
of man... understood in another sense."" There exist a histor

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

109

philosophy enveloped in its own fundamental conceptions. A contra
diction according to what Levinas often will call "formal logic."
Let us follow this displacement. The respectful, moderate reproach
directed against Husserl in a Heideggerean style will soon become the
main charge of an indictment this time directed against Heidegger, and
made with a violence that will not cease to grow. Certainly it is not a
question of denouncing as militant theoretism a thought which, in its
initial act, refused to treat the self-evidence of the object as its ultimate
recourse; a thought for which the historicity of meaning, according to
Levinas's own terms, "destroys clarity and constitution as authentic
modes of the existence of the mind" (En decouvrant !'existence [hereafter
EDE]); and for which, finally, "the self-evident is no longer the fundamental mode of intellection," for which "existence is irreducible to the
light of the self-evident" and "the drama of existence" is played out
"before light" (ibid.). Nevertheless, at a singular depth-but the fact
and the accusation are made only more significant by it-Heidegger still
would have questioned and reduced theoretism from within, and in the
name of, a Greco-Platonic tradition under the surveillance of the agency
of the glance and the metaphor of light. That is, by the spatial pair insideoutside (but is this, in all its aspects, a spatial pair?) which gives life to the
opposition of subject and object. By allegedly reducing this last schema,
Heidegger would have retained what made it possible and necessary: light,
unveiling, comprehension or precomprehension. This is what the texts written
after En decouvrant !'existence tell us. "Heideggerean care, illuminated as it is
by comprehension (even if comprehension offers itself as care), is already
determined by the struc

icily and a temporality of man that are not only predicates but "the,;!
very substantiality of his substance." It is "this structure ... which
One already foresees the unease to which a thought rejecting the,
man's historical situation as a theory seeking to consider everything sub,
specie aeternitatis" (THI) will have to resign itself later, especially in that it
the 'beyond' of history withdraws beings from history's jurisdiction.
There is no contradiction here but rather a displacement of concepts
in this case the concept of history-which we must follow. Perhaps
then the appearance of' contradiction will vanish as the fantasy of a

ture inside-outside' that characterizes light." In making the structure
"inside-outside" tremble at the point where it would have resisted
Heidegger, Levinas in no way pretends to erase it, or to deny its meaning
and existence. Nor does he do so, moreover, when the opposition subjectobject or cogito-cogitatum is in question. In the style by which strong and
faithful thought is recognized (this is Heidegger's style
philosophies whose presuppositions he describes are in general neither
refuted nor criticized. Here, for example, it is a question simply of
revealing beneath this truth, as that which founds it and is dissimulated
within it, "a situation which precedes the division of Being into an

110 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

inside and an outside." However it is also a question of inaugurating, in a
way that is to be new, quite new, a metaphysics of radical separation and
exteriority. One anticipates that this metaphysics will have some
difficulty finding its language in the medium of a traditional logos
entirely governed by the structure "inside-outside," "interior-exterior."
Thus, "without being knowledge, Heidegger's temporality is ecstasy,
'being outside itself' Not a transcendence of theory, but already
deportation from an interior toward an exterior." The structure of Mitsein's
itself will be interpreted as a Platonic inheritance, belonging to the world
of light. In effect, through the experience of eros and paternity,
through the waiting for death, there should arise a relationship to the
other which can no longer be understood as a modification of "the Eleatic
notion of Being" (Le temps et lautre [hereafter TA]). The latter would demand
that multiplicity be included in, subjected to, the domination of unity.
And it would still govern Plato's philosophy,

according to Levinas, even unto its concept of femininity (conceived as
matter in the categories of activity and passivity) and its concept of the
city-state which "must imitate the world of ideas."
"It is ... toward a pluralism which does not fuse into unity that we
wish to make our way; and, if it can be dared, to break with Parme-"
nides" (TA). Thus, Levinas exhorts us to a second parricide. The Greek
father who still holds us under his sway must be killed; and this is whit
a Greek-Plato-could never resolve to do, deferring the act into a hal
lucinatory murder. A hallucination within the hallucination that'
already speech. But will a non-Greek ever succeed in doing what 'a
Greek in this case could not do, except by disguising himself as a
Greek, by speaking Greek, by feigning to speak Greek in order to get near
the king? And since it is a question of killing a speech, will we ever
know who is the last victim of this stratagem? Can one feign speaking a
language? The Eleatic stranger and disciple of Parmenides had to give;
language its due for having vanquished him: shaping non-Being
according to Being, he had to "say farewell to an unnamable opposite;
of Being" and had to confine non-Being to its relativity to Being, that i3'
Why was the repetition of the murder necessary according ,td
multiplicity and alterity are not understood as the absolute solitude of th

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

existent in its existence. These are the translations of Seiendes and Sein chosen
by Levinas at this point "for reasons of euphony" (TA).19 This choice
will always retain a certain ambiguity: by existent, in effect, Levinas
almost if not always understands the being which is man, being in the form
of Dasein. Now, thus understood, the existent is not being (Seiendes) in general,
but refers to what Heidegger calls Existenz-mainly because it has the same
root-that is "the mode of Being, and precisely, the Being of the being
which keeps itself open for the aperture of Being, and within it." "Was
bedeutet 'Existenz' in Sein and Zeit? Das wort nennt eine Weise des Seins,
and zwar das Sein desjenigen Seienden, das offen steht fur die Offenheit des
Seins, in der es steht, indem es sie aussteht" (Introduction to Was ist
Metaphysik).
Now this solitude of the "existent" in its "existence" would be
primordial and could not be conceived on the basis of the neutral unity of
existence which Levinas often and profoundly describes under the
heading of the "there is." But is not the "there is" the totality of
indeterminate, neutral, anonymous beings rather than Being itself? The

theme of the "there is" calls for systematic confrontation with
eidegger's allusions to the "es gibt" (Being and Time, Letter on Humanism),
and for a confrontation too, of terror, which Levinas opposes to
Heideggerean anguish, with the experience of fright, which Heidegger
says, in the Nachwort to Was ist Metaphysik, "always resides near essential
anxiety."
The relationship to the other arises from the depths of this solitude.
Without it, without this primordial secret, parricide is philosophy's
theatrical fiction. To understand the secret on the basis of the unity of
existence, on the pretext that it exists or that it is the secret of the
existent, "is to confine oneself to unity, and to let Parmenides escape
every parricide" (TA). Therefore, Levinas henceforth will move toward a
thought of original difference. Is this thought in contradiction with
Heidegger's intentions? Is there a difference between this difference
and the difference of which Heidegger speaks? Is their juxtaposition
anything but verbal? And which difference is more original? We will
consider these questions later.
A world of light and of unity, a "philosophy of a world of light, a
orld without time." In this heliopolitics "the social ideal will be
sought in an ideal of fusion ... the subject ... losing himself in a

111

112

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

collective representation, in a common ideal.... It is the collectivity
which says 'us,' and which, turned toward the intelligible sun, toward the
truth, experience, the other at his side and not face to face with him....
Miteinandersein also remains the collectivity of the with, and its authentic
form is revealed around the truth." Now, "we hope to show, for our part,
that it is not the preposition mit which must describe the original relation
with the other." Beneath solidarity, beneath companionship, before
Mitsein, which would be only a derivative and modified form of the
originary relation with the other, Levinas already aims for the face-to-face,
the encounter with the face. "Face to face without intermediary" and
without "communion." Without intermediary and without communion,
neither mediate nor immediate, such is the truth of our relation to the
other, the truth to which the traditional logos is forever inhospitable.
This unthinkable truth of living experience, to which Levinas returns
ceaselessly, cannot possibly be encompassed by philosophical speech
without immediately revealing, by philosophy's

own light, that philosophy's surface is severely cracked, and that what
was taken for its solidity is its rigidity. It could doubtless be shown that it is
in the nature of Levinas's writing, at its decisive moments, to move along
these cracks, masterfully progressing by negations, and by negation
against negation. Its proper route is not that of an "either this ... or that,"
but of a "neither this ... nor that." The poetic force of
metaphor is often the trace of this rejected alternative, this wounding
of language. Through it, in its opening, experience itself is silently';
revealed.
Without intermediary and without communion, absolute proximity
and absolute distance: "eros in which, within the proximity to the
simultaneously of this proximity and this duality." A community of
nonpresence, and therefore of nonphenomenality. Not a community
without light, not a blindfolded synagogue, but a community anterior to
Platonic light. A light before neutral light, before the truth which
arrives as a third party, the truth "which we look toward together," the
judgmental arbitrator's truth. Only the other, the totally other, can be
manifested as what it is before the shared truth, within a certain non
manifestation and a certain absence. It can be said only of the other
that its phenomenon is a certain nonphenomenon, its presence (is) a

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

certain absence. Not pure and simple absence, for there logic could
make its claim, but a certain absence. Such a formulation shows dearly that
within this experience of the other the logic of noncontradiction, that is,
everything which Levinas designates as "formal logic," is contested in its
root. This root would be not only the root of our language, but the root of
all of Western philosophy, 20 particularly phenomenology and ontology.
This naivete would prevent them from thinking the other (that is from
thinking; and this would indeed be the reason why, although Levinas,
"the enemy of thought," does not say so), and from aligning their
discourse with the other. The consequence would be double. (a)
Because they do not think the other, they do not have time. Without
time, they do not have history. The absolute alterity of each instant,
without which there would be no time, cannot be produced-constitutedwithin the identity of the subject or the existent. It comes into time
through the Other. Bergson and Heidegger would have overlooked this
(De ]'existence a ]'existent [hereafter EE]), and Husserl even more so. (b)
More seriously, to renounce the other (not by being weaned from it, but
by detaching oneself from it, which is actually to be in relation to it, to
respect it while nevertheless overlooking it, that is, while knowing it,
identifying it, assimilating it), to renounce the other is to enclose
oneself within solitude (the bad solitude of solidity and self-identity) and
to repress ethical transcendence. In effect, if the Parmenidean traditionwe know now what this means forLevinas--disregards the irreducible
solitude of the "existent," by the same token it disregards the relationship
to the other. It does not think solitude, it does not appear to itself to be
solitude, because it is the solitude of totality and opacity. "Solipsism is
neither observation nor sophism; it is the very structure of reason."
Therefore, there is a soliloquy of reason and a solitude of light. Incapable
of respecting the Being and meaning of the other, phenomenology and
ontology would be

philosophies of violence. Through them, the entire philosophical tradition,
in its meaning and at bottom, would make common cause with
oppression and with the totalitarianism of the same. The ancient clan
destine friendship between light and power, the ancient complicity be
een theoretical objectivity and technico-political possession." "If the other
could be possessed, seized, and known, it would not be the
other. To possess, to know, to grasp are all synonyms of power" (TA). To

113

1 14

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

see and to know, to have and to will, unfold only within the oppressive and
luminous identity of the same; and they remain, for Levinas, fundamental
categories of phenomenology and ontology. Everything given to me
within light appears as given to myself by myself Henceforward, the
heliological metaphor only turns away our glance, providing an alibi for the
historical violence of light: a displacement of technicopolitical oppression
in the direction of philosophical discourse. For it has always been
believed that metaphors exculpate, lift the weight of things and of acts.
If there is no history, except through language, and if language (except
when it names Being itself or nothing: almost never) is elementally
metaphorical, Borges is correct: "Perhaps universal history is but the
history of several metaphors." Light is only one example of these "several"
fundamental "metaphors," but what an example! Who will ever
dominate it, who will ever pronounce its meaning without first being
pronounced by it? What language will ever escape it? How, for example,
will the metaphysics of the face as the epiphany of the other free itself of
light? Light perhaps has no opposite; if it does, it is certainly not night. If all
languages combat within it, modifying only the
same metaphor and choosing the best light, Borges, several pages later, is
correct again: "Perhaps universal history is but the history of the
diverse intonations of several metaphors" (La sphere de Pascal; my italics).

II PHENOMENOLOGY, ONTOLOGY, METAPHYSICS
These measures were critical, but they obeyed the voice of full cer
tainty. They appeared, through the essays, the concrete and subtle
analyses concerning exoticism, the caress, insomnia, fecundity, wor ,
the instant, fatigue, only at the point, at the edge of the indescribable
indestructible which opens up classical conceptuality, seeking its own'
conceptuality between rejections. Totality and infinity, the great work, no
only enriches these concrete analyses but organizes them within 'a
itself beyond the disdain or disregard of the other, that is, beyond the"
appreciation or possession, understanding and knowledge of the other,,,
metaphysics or ethics. Metaphysical transcendence is desire.
This concept of desire is as anti-Hegelian as it can possibly be. It does not
designate a movement of negation and assimilation, the negation

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

1 15

of alterity first necessary in order to become "self-consciousness" "certain
of itself" (Phenomenology of the Mind and Encyclopedia). For Levinas, on the
contrary, desire is the respect and knowledge of the other as other, the
ethico-metaphysical moment whose transgression consciousness must
forbid itself According to Hegel, on the contrary, this gesture of
transgression and assimilation is necessary and essential. Levinas sees in it a
premetaphysical, natural necessity, and in several splendid analyses
separates desire from enjoyment-which Hegel does not appear to do.
Enjoyment is only deferred in work:22 thus, Hegelian desire would be
only need, in Levinas's sense. But one rightly suspects that things
would appear more complicated, if one followed closely the movement of
certitude and the truth of desire in the Phenomenology of the Mind. Despite his
anti-Kierkegaardian protests, Levinas here returns to the themes of Fear
and Trembling: the movement of desire can be what it is only paradoxically, as
the renunciation of desire.
Neither theoretical intentionality nor the affectivity of need exhaust the
movement of desire: they have as their meaning and end their own
accomplishment, their own fulfillment and satisfaction within the
totality and identity of the same. Desire, on the contrary, permits itself to
be appealed to by the absolutely irreducible exteriority of the other to
which it must remain infinitely inadequate. Desire is equal only to
excess. No totality will ever encompass it. Thus, the metaphysics of desire is
a metaphysics of infinite separation. Not a consciousness of separation as a
Judaic consciousness, as an unhappy consciousness:23 in the Hegelian
Odyssey Abraham's unhappiness is an expediency, the provisional
necessity of a figure and a transition within the horizons of a reconciliatory
return to self and absolute knowledge. Here there is no return. For desire is
not unhappy. It is opening and freedom. Further, a desired infinite may
govern desire itself, but it can never appease desire by its presence. "And if
desire were to cease with God / Ah, I would envy you hell." (May we
cite Claudel to comment upon Levinas, when the latter also polemizes
against "this spirit admired since [our] earliest youth"?)
The infinitely other is the invisible, since vision opens up only the
illusory and relative exteriority of theory and of need. A provisional
exteriority, given only within sight of its own consummation, its own
consumption. Inaccessible, the invisible is the most high. This

116

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

expression-perhaps inhabited by the Platonic resonances Levinas
evokes, but more so by others more readily recognizable-tears apart, by the
superlative excess, the spatial literality of the metaphor, No matter how
high it is, height is always accessible; the most high, however, is higher
than height. No addition of more height will ever measure it. It does not
belong to space, is not of this world. But what necessity compels this
inscription of language in space at the very moment when it exceeds
space? And if the pole of metaphysical transcendence is a spatial nonheight, what, in the last analysis, legitimates the expression of transascendance, borrowed from Jean Wahl? The theme of the face perhaps
will help us understand it.
The ego is the same. The alterity or negativity interior to the ego, the
interior difference, is but an appearance: an illusion, a "play of the
Same," the "mode of identification" of an ego whose essential
moments are called body, possession, home, economy, etc. Levinas
devotes some splendid descriptions to them. But this play of the same is not
monotonous, is not repeated as monologue and formal tautology. As the
work of identification and the concrete production of egoity, it entails a
certain negativity. A finite negativity, an internal and relative modification
through which the ego affects itself by itself, within its own movement of
identification. Thus it alters itself toward itself within itself The
resistance to work, by provoking it, remains a moment of the same, a
finite moment that forms a system and a totality with the agent. It
necessarily follows, then, that Levinas will describe history as a blinding to
the other, and as the laborious procession of the same. One may wonder
whether history can be history, if there is history, when negativity is
enclosed within the circle of the same, and when work does not truly
meet alterity, providing itself with its own resistance. One wonders
whether history itself does not begin with this relationship to the other
which Levinas places beyond history. The framework of this question
should govern the entire reading of Totality

and Infinity. In any event, one observes the displacement of the concept
of historicity of which we spoke above. It must be acknowledged that
without this displacement no anti-Hegelianism could be logically consequent. The necessary condition for this anti-Hegelianism is therefore
fulfilled.
A precaution must be made: the theme of the concrete (nonformal)

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

117

tautology or of false (finite) heterology-this very difficult theme is
proposed rather discreetly at the beginning of Totality and Infinity, but it
conditions every affirmation made in the book. If negativity (work,
history, etc.) never has a relation to the other, if the other is not the
simple negation of the same, then neither separation nor metaphysical
transcendence can be conceived under the category of negativity. Just asas we saw above-simple internal consciousness could not provide itself with
time and with the absolute alterity of every instant without the irruption
of the totally-other, so the ego cannot engender alterity within itself
without encountering the Other.
If one is not convinced by these initial propositions authorizing the
equation of the ego and the same, one never will be. If one does not
follow Levinas when he affirms that the things offered to work or to desirein the Hegelian sense: for example, natural objectivity-belong to the ego,
to the ego's economy (to the same), and do not offer the absolute
resistance reserved for the other (Others); if one is tempted to think that
this last resistance supposes, in its innermost meaning, the possibility of
the resistance of things-the existence of the world which is not myself and
in which I am, in as original a way as one may wish, for example as origin
of the world within the world, although it is not to be confused with this
possibility; if one does not follow Levinas when he affirms that the true
resistance to the same is not that of things, is not real but rather is
intelligible, 14 and if one rebels against the notion of a purely intelligible
resistance, then in all these cases one will follow Levinas no further. Nor
will one be able to follow, without an indefinable malaise, the conceptual
operations liberated by the classical dissymetry of the same and other, as
they are overturned; or (as a classical mind would say), while they
feign permitting themselves to be overturned, all the while remaining
the same, impassive beneath an algebraic substitution.
What, then, is this encounter with the absolutely-other? Neither
representation, nor limitation, nor conceptual relation to the same. The ego
and the other do not permit themselves to be dominated or made into
totalities by a concept of relationship. And first of all because the concept
(material of language), which is always given to the other, cannot encompass
the other, cannot include the other. The dative or vocative dimension
which opens the original direction of language, cannot lend

118 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

119

itself to inclusion in and modification by the accusative or attributive
dimension of the object without violence. Language, therefore, cannot
make its own possibility a totality and include within itself its own origin or
its own end.
Truthfully, one does not have to wonder what this encounter is. It is the
encounter, the only way out, the only adventuring outside oneself toward
the unforeseeably-other. Without hope of return. In every sense of this
expression, which is why this eschatology which awaits nothing
sometimes appears infinitely hopeless. Truthfully, in La trace de l'autre
eschatology does not only "appear" hopeless. It is given as such, and
renunciation belongs to its essential meaning. In describing liturgy,
desire, and the work of art as ruptures of the Economy and the odyssey,
as the impossibility of return to the same, Levinas speaks of an
"eschatology without hope for the self or without liberation in my
time."
Therefore, there is no way to conceptualize the encounter: it is made
possible by the other, the unforeseeable "resistant to all categories."
Concepts suppose an anticipation, a horizon within which alterity is
amortized as soon as it is announced precisely because it has let itself be
foreseen. The infinitely-other cannot be bound by a concept, cannot be
thought on the basis of a horizon; for a horizon is always a horizon of the
same, the elementary unity within which eruptions and surprises are
always welcomed by understanding and recognized. Thus we are obliged
to think in opposition to the truisms which we believedwhich we still
cannot not believe-to be the very ether of our thought and language.
To attempt to think the opposite is stifling. And it is a question not only
of thinking the opposite which is still in complicity

Present not as a total presence but as a trace. Therefore, before all
dogmas, all conversions, all articles of faith or philosophy, experience
itself is eschatological at its origin and in each of its aspects.
Face to face with the other within a glance and a speech which both
maintain distance and interrupt all totalities, this being-together as
separation precedes or exceeds society, collectivity, community. Levinas
calls it religion. It opens ethics. The ethical relation is a religious relation
(Difficile liberte [hereafter DL]). Not a religion, but the religion, the
religiosity of the religious. This transcendence beyond negativity is not
accomplished by an intuition of a positive presence; it "only institutes
language at the point where neither no nor yes is the first word" (TI) but
an interrogation. Not a theoretical interrogation, however, but a total
question, a distress and denuding, a supplication, a demanding prayer
addressed to a freedom, that is, to a commandment: the only possible
ethical imperative, the only incarnated nonviolence in that it is respect for
the other. An immediate respect for the other himself-one might say,
although without following any literal indication by Levinas-because it
does not pass through the neutral element of the universal, and through
respect-in the Kantian sense 26- for the law.
This restitution of metaphysics then permits the radicalization and
systematization of the previous reductions of phenomenology and ontology.
The act of seeing is at the outset a respectful knowledge, and light passes for the

intuitive contact (in ethics, in the sense given to it by Levinas, the

logic")." Doubtless this encounter of the unforeseeable itself is the only

non-being, while the same and the other are-the theoretical relation is
ontology. According to Levinas, the latter always brings the other back into
the midst of the same and does so for the benefit of the unity of Being.

the identification of the same, the light in which I provide myself with what

empirical freedom, even if it is called reason within history. Reason
would be nature. Metaphysics begins when theory criticizes itself as

120 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

ontology, as the dogmatism and spontaneity of the same, and when
metaphysics, in departing from itself, lets itself be put into question by the
other in the movement of ethics. Although in fact it is secondary,
metaphysics as the critique of ontology is rightfully and philosophically
primary. If it is true that "Western philosophy most often has been an
ontology" dominated since Socrates by a Reason which receives only
what it gives itself,27 a Reason which does nothing but recall itself to itself,
and if ontology is tautotology and egology, then it has always neutralized the
other, in every sense of the word. Phenomenological neutralization, one
might be tempted to say, gives the most subtle and modern form to this
historical, political and authoritarian neutralization. Only metaphysics can
free the other from the light of Being or from the phenomenon which
"takes away from Being its resistance."
Heideggerean "ontology," despite its seductive appearance, would not
escape this framework. It would still remain "egology" and even
"egoism": "Sein and Zeit has argued perhaps but one sole thesis: Being is
inseparable from the comprehension of Being (which unfolds as time);
Being is already an appeal to subjectivity. The primacy of ontology for
Heidegger does not rest on the truism: 'to know the existent it is neces
sary to have comprehended the Being of the existent.' To affirm the
priority of Being over the existent is, indeed, to decide the essence of
philosophy; it is to subordinate the relation with someone, who is an
existent (the ethical relation), to a relation with the Being of the existent,
which, impersonal, permits the apprehension, the domination of the
existent (a relationship of knowing), subordinates justice to free
dom... the mode of remaining the same in the midst of the other" (TI,
p. 45). Despite all the misunderstandings which may be embedded in

nonetheless oppressive and possessive. By another paradox, the phil
osophy of the neutral communicates with a philosophy of the site, of
rootedness, of pagan violence, of ravishment, of enthusiasm, a phil
osophy offered up to the sacred, that is, to the anonymous divinity, the
divinity without the Deity (DL). It is a "shameful materialism" in that it
is complete, for at heart materialism is not primarily sensualism, but a
recognized primacy of the neutral (TI). The notion of primacy, employed so
frequently by Levinas, well translates the gesture of his entire critique.
According to the indication present in the notion of archia, the
philosophical beginning is immediately transposed into an ethical or
philosophical command. From the very first, primacy indicates principle and
chief. All the classical concepts interrogated by Levinas are thus dragged
toward the agora, summoned to justify themselves in an ethico-political
language that they have not always sought-or believed that they sought-to
speak, summoned to transpose themselves into this language by confessing
their violent aims. Yet they already spoke this language in the city, and
spoke it well, by means of the detours of philosophy and despite
philosophy's apparent disinterest, notwithstanding its eventual return to
power. Here we find the premises for a non-Marxist reading of philosophy
as ideology. The ways chosen by Levinas are decidedly difficult: rejecting
idealism and the philosophies of subjectivity, he must also denounce the
neutrality of a "Logos which is the verb of no one" (TI). (It could no doubt
be demonstrated that Levinas, uncomfortably situated in the difference
between Husserl and Heidegger-and, indeed, by virtue of the history of his
thought-always criticizes the one in a style and according to a scheme
borrowed from the other, and finishes by sending them off into the wings
together as partners in the "play of the same" and as accomplices in the
same historico-philosophical coup.) The verb must not only be the verb of
someone-it must overflow, in its movement toward the other, what is called
the speaking subject. Neither the philosophies of the neutral nor

then makes possible every logos or every rationalism. A total logos still, in
order to be logos, would have to let itself be proffered toward the other
beyond its own totality. If, for example, there is an ontology or a logos of
the comprehension of the Being (of beings), it is in that "already the
comprehension of Being is said to the existent, who again arises behind
the theme in which he is presented. This 'saying to the other'-this
relationship to the other as interlocutor, this relation with an existentprecedes all ontology; it is the ultimate relation in Being. Ontology
presupposes metaphysics" (TI, pp. 47-48). "Prior to the unveiling of
Being in general, as the basis of knowledge and meaning of Being, there
is a relationship with the existent which is expressed; before the
ontological level, the ethical level." Ethics is therefore metaphysics.
"Morality is not a branch of philosophy, but first philosophy."
The absolute overflowing of ontology-as the totality and unity of the
same: Being-by the other occurs as infinity because no totality can constrain
it. The infinity irreducible to the representation of infinity, the infinity
exceeding the ideation in which it is thought, thought of as more than I
can think, as that which cannot be an object or a simple "objective
reality" of the idea-such is the pole of metaphysical transcendence. After
the epekeina tes ousias, the Cartesian idea of infinity made metaphysics emerge
for a second time in Western ontology. But what

neither Plato nor Descartes recognized (along with several others, if we
may be permitted not to believe to the same extent as Levinas in their
solitude among the philosophical crowd which understands neither true
transcendence nor the strange idea of Infinity) is that the expression of
this infinity is the face.
The face is not only a visage which may be the surface of things or
animal facies, aspect, or species. It is not only, following the origin of
the word, what is seen, seen because it is naked. It is also that which sees. Not
so much that which sees things-a theoretical relation-but that which
exchanges its glance. The visage is a face only in the face-to-face. As
Scheler said (but our citation must not make us forget that Levinas i5 nothing
less than Schelerian): "I see not only the eyes of an other, I see

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS ~t

uses the eye as its instrument, but is itself therein manifest. We have,
however, already stated, when referring to the external covering of the
human body, that in contrast with the bodies of animals, the heart of
life pulses through and throughout it. And in much the same sense it
can be asserted of art that it has to invent every point of the external
appearance into the direct testimony of the human eye, which is the
source of soul-life, and reveals spirit."28 This is perhaps the occasion to
emphasize, concerning a precise point, a theme that we will enlarge
upon later: Levinas is very close to Hegel, much closer than he admits,
and at the very moment when he is apparently opposed to Hegel in the
most radical fashion. This is a situation he must share with all anti
Hegelian thinkers, and whose final significance calls for much thought.
Here, in particular, on the relations between desire and the eye,
between sound and theory, the convergence is as profound as the
difference, being neither simply added to nor juxtaposed with it. In
effect, like Levinas Hegel thought that the eye, not aiming at "consumption," suspends desire. It is the very limit of desire (and perhaps,
thereby, its resource) and is the first theoretical sense. We must not
conceive light and the eye's opening on the basis of any physiology, but
on the basis of the relation between death and desire. After having spoken of
taste, touch, and smell, Hegel again writes, in the Aesthetics: "Sight, on the
other hand, possesses a purely ideal relation to objects by means of light,
a material which is at the same time immaterial, and which suffers on its
part the objects to continue in their free selfsubsistence, making them
appear and reappear, but which does not, as the atmosphere or fire does,
consume them actively either by imperceptible degrees or patently.
Everything, then is an object of the appetiteless vision, [la vue exempte de
desirs] which, however, in so far as it remains unimpaired in its integrity,
merely is disclosed in its form
and colour."29
This neutralization of desire is what makes sight excellent for Hegel. But
for Levinas, this neutralization is also, and for the same reasons, the first
violence, even though the face is not what it is when the glance is absent.
Violence, then, would be the solitude of a mute glance, of a face

Did not Hegel say this too? "If we ask ourselves now in which
point to the eye. For in the eye the soul concentrates itself; it not merely

by itself, contrary to what one may be led to believe, does not respect the
other. Respect, beyond grasp and contact, beyond touch, smell and

124

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

taste, can be only as desire, and metaphysical desire does not seek to
consume, as do Hegelian desire or need. This is why Levinas places
sound above light. ("Thought is language and is thought in an element
analogous to sound and not to light." What does this analogy mean here, a
difference and a resemblance, a relation between the sensible sound and
the sound of thought as intelligible speech, between sensibility and
signification, the senses and sense? This is a question also posed by
Hegel, admiring the word Sinn.)
In Totality and Infinity the movement of metaphysics is thus also the
transcendence of hearing in relation to seeing. But in Hegel's Aesthetics too:
"The remaining ideal sense is hearing. This is in signal contrast to the one
just described. Hearing is concerned with the tone, rather than the form
and colour of an object, with the vibration of what is corporeal; it requires
no process of dissolution, as the sense of smell requires, but merely a
trembling of the object, by which the same is in no wise impoverished.
This ideal motion, in which through its sound what is as it were the
simple individuality [subjectivite] the soul of the material thing expresses
itself, the ear receives also in an ideal way, just as the eye shape and
colour, and suffers thereby what is ideal or not external in the object to
appeal to what is spiritual or non-corporeal."" But:
Hearing, which, as also the sight, does not belong to the senses of
action [lens pratiques] but those of contemplation [sens thEoriques]; and
is, in fact, still more ideal than sight. For the unruffled, aesthetic observation
of works of art no doubt permits the objects to stand out quietly in their
freedom just as they are without any desire to impair that effect in any way;
but that which it apprehends is not that which is itself essentially ideally
composed, but rather on the contrary, that which receives its consistency
in its sensuous existence. The ear, on the contrary, receives the result of
that ideal vibration of material substance, without placing itself in a practical
relation towards the objects, a result by means of which it is no longer the
material object in its repose, but the first example of the more ideal activity
of the soul''

itself which is apprehended"
The question of the analogy would thus lead us back to the notion of
trembling, which seems to us decisive in Hegel's Aesthetics in that it opens

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

125

the passage to ideality. Further, in order to confront systematically
Hegel's and Levinas's thoughts on the theme of the face, one would
have to consult not only the pages of the Phenomenology of the Mind devoted
to physiognomy, but also paragraph 411 of the Encyclopedia on mind,
face, and language.
For reasons now familiar to us, the face-to-face eludes every cat
egory. For within it the face is given simultaneously as expression and
as speech. Not only as glance, but as the original unity of glance and
speech, eyes and mouth, that speaks, but also pronounces its hunger.
Thus it is also that which hears the invisible, for "thought is language,"
and "is thought in an element analogous to sound and not to light."
This unity of the face precedes, in its signification, the dispersion of
senses and organs of sensibility. Its signification is therefore irredu
cible. Moreover, the face does not signify. It does not incarnate, envelop,
or signal anything other than self, soul, subjectivity, etc. Thought is
speech, and is therefore immediately face. In this, the thematic of the
face belongs to the most modern philosophy of language and of the
body itself The other is not signaled by his face, he is this face: "Absolutely present, in his face, the Other-without any metaphor-faces
me."" The other, therefore, is given "in person" and without allegory
only in the face. Let us recall what Feuerbach, who also made the
themes of height, substance, and face communicate with each other,
said on this subject: "That which is situated highest in space is also in its
quality the highest part of man, that which is closest to him, that which
one can no longer separate from him-and this is his head. If I see a man's
head, it is the man himself who I see; but if I only see his torso, I see no
more than his torso."33 That which can no longer be separated from.. is substance in
its essential predicates and "in itself" Levinas also often says kath'auto
and "substance" in speaking of the other as face. The face is presence, ousia.
The face is not a metaphor, not a figure. The discourse on the face is
neither allegory nor, as one might be tempted to believe, prosopopoeia.
Consequently the height of the face (in relation to the rest of the body)
perhaps determines in part (in part only, as we will see later) the expression
most-high which we examined above. If the height of the mosthigh, as
we might be tempted to say, does not belong to space (and this is why the
superlative must destroy space as it constructs the metaphor),

126

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

it is not because it is foreign to space, but because (within) space it is the
origin of space, orienting space through speech and glance. through the
face, the chief who commands body and space from above. (Aristotle,
indeed, compares the transcendental principle of the good to the chief of
the armies; however, he overlooks both the face, and the fact that the god
of the armies is the Face.) The face does not signify, does not present itself
as a sign, but expresses itself, offering itself in person, in itself, kath'auto: "the
thing in itself expresses itself" To express oneself is to be behind the sign. To
be behind the sign: is this not, first of all, to be capable of attending (to) one's
speech, to assist it, according to the expression used in the Phaedrus as
argument against Theuth (or Hermes)-an expression Levinas makes his
own on several occasions. Only living speech, in its mastery and
magisteriality, is able to assist itself; and only living speech is expression
and not a servile sign-on the condition that it is truly speech, "the
creative voice, and not the accomplice voice which is a servant" (E.
Jabes). And we know that all the gods of writing (Greece, Egypt, Assyria,
Babylonia) have the status of auxiliary gods, servile secretaries of the
great god, lunar and clever couriers who occasionally dethrone the king
of the gods by dishonorable means. The written and the work are not
expressions but signs for

Levinas.
Along with the reference to the epekeina tes ousias, this is at very least
the second Platonic theme of Totality and Infinity. It is also to be found in
Nicholas of Cusa. "While the worker abandons his work, which then
pursues its independent destiny, the verb of the professor is inseparable

escaping better than speech from empirical urgencies. That, by neutralizing
the demands of empirical "economy," writing's essence is more
"metaphysical" (in Levinas's sense) than speech? That the writer
absents himself better, that is, expresses himself better as other,
addresses himself to the other more effectively than the man of speech?
And that, in depriving himself of the enjoyments and effects of his signs, the
writer more effectively renounces violence? It is true that he perhaps
intends only to multiply his signs to infinity, thus forgetting-at very
least-the other, the infinitely other as death, and thus practicing writing
as deferral and as an economy of death. The limit between violence and
nonviolence is perhaps not between speech and writing but within each of
them. The thematic of the trace (which Levinas distinguishes from the
effect, the path, or the sign which is not related to the other as the invisible
absolute) should lead to a certain rehabilitation of writing. Is not the "He"
whom transcendence and generous absence uniquely announce in the
trace more readily the author of writing than of speech? The work,
trans-economy, the pure expenditure as determined by Levinas, is neither
play nor death. It is not simply to be confused with either the letter or
with speech. It is not a sign, and therefore its concept cannot include the
concept of the work found in Totality and Infinity. Levinas is thus at once
quite dose to and quite far from Nietzsche and Bataille.
Maurice Blanchot speaks of his disagreement with this preeminence of
oral discourse, which resembles "the tranquil humanist and Socratic
speech which brings us close to the speaker."35 Moreover, how could
Hebraism belittle the letter, in praise of which Levinas writes so well? For
example: "To admit the action of literature on men-this is perhaps the
ultimate wisdom of the West, in which the people of the Bible will be
recognized" (DL); and "The spirit is free in the letter, and subju

from the very person who proffers it."" The critique of the work thus

sense, the "speech activity" in which I "am absent, missing from my

"frankness" of expression essentially an aspect of living speech for him who
is not God? This question is meaningless for Levinas, who con`
ceives the face in terms of the "resemblance" of man and God. Are no

"protection against the madness of a direct contact with the Sacred"
(DL). The aspect of living and original speech itself which Levinas seeks
to save is clear. Without its possibility, outside its horizon, writing is
nothing. In this sense, writing will always be secondary. To liberate it
from this possibility and this horizon, from this essential secondari
ness, is to deny it as writing, and to leave room for a grammar or a
lexicon without language, for cybernetics or electronics. But it is only

127

128 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

in God that speech, as presence, as the origin and horizon of writing, is
realized without defect. One would have to be able to show that only
this reference to the speech of God distinguishes Levinas's intentions
from those of Socrates in the Phaedrus; and that for a thought of original
finitude this distinction is no longer possible. And that if writing is
secondary at this point, nothing, however, has occurred before it.
As for Levinas's ties to Blanchot, it seems to us that despite the
frequent rapprochements he proposes, the profound and incontestable
affinities between them all belong to the critical and negative moment,
within the hollow space of finitude in which messianic eschatology
comes to resonate, within the expectation of expectation in which
Levinas has begun to hear a response. This response is still called
expectation, of course, but Levinas no longer has to await it. The affinity
ceases, it seems to us, at the moment when eschatalogical positivity
retrospectively comes to illuminate the common route, to lift the
finitude and pure negativity of the question, when the neutral is
determined. Blanchot could probably extend over all of Levinas's propositions what he says about the dissymetry within the space of communication: "Here, I believe, is what is decisive in the affirmation

which we must hear, and which must be maintained independently
of the theological context in which it occurs." But is this possible?
Independent of its "theological context" (an expression that Levinas would
most likely reject) does not this entire discourse collapse?
To be behind the sign which is in the world is afterward to remain
invisible to the world within epiphany. In the face, the other is given
over in person as other, that is, as that which does not reveal itself, as that
which cannot be made thematic. I could not possibly speak of the
Other, make of the other a theme, pronounce the Other as object, in
the accusative. I can only, I must only speak to the other; that is, I must
call him in the vocative, which is not a category, a case of speech, bu
rather the bursting forth, the very raising up of speech. Categories must
be missing for the Other not to be overlooked; but for the Other not to
be overlooked, He must present himself as absence, and must appear as

reach it only as I must reach it. But I must only reach it as the inaccessible,
the invisible, the intangible. Secret, separate, invisible like Gyjes ("the very
condition of man")-this is the very state, the very status of what is called the
psyche. This absolute separation, this natural atheism, this lying freedom
in which truth and discourse take root-all this is a "great glory for the
creator." An affirmation which, for once at least, is hardly disorienting.
For the face to present the other without metaphor, speech must not
only translate thought. Thought, of course, already must be speech, but
above all the body must also remain a language. Rational knowledge must
not be the first word of words. If one is to believe Levinas, Husserl and
Heidegger, at bottom, accepted the classical subordination of language to
thought, and body to language. On the contrary, MerleauPonty, "better
than others," would have shown "that disincarnated thought, thinking of
speech before speaking it, thought as constitutive of the world of speech,
was a myth." But by the force of a movement proper to Levinas, he
accepts this extreme "modern" audacity only to redirect it toward an
infinitism that this audacity itself must suppose, according to himself;
and the form of this infinitism is often quite classical, pre-Kantian rather
than Hegelian. Thus, the themes of one's own body as language and as
intentionality cannot get around the classical dangers, and thought
cannot first be language unless it is acknowledged that thought is first and
irreducibly a relation to the other (which it seems to us did not escape
Merleau-Ponty);36 but a relation to an irreducible other who summons me
without possibility of return from without, for in this order is
presented the infinity which no thought can enclose and which forbids
all monologue "even if it had

the corporal intentionality' of Merleau-Ponty." Despite all appearances
and all habitual thinking, it must be acknowledged here that the dissociation of thought and language, and the subordination of the latter to
the former, are proper to a philosophy of finitude. And this demonstration
would refer us once more to the Cartesian Cogito of the third Meditation,
beyond Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and Husserl. And does so according to a
schema that seems to us to support the entirety of
Levinas's thought: the other is the other only if his alterity is absolutely

130 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

As speech and glance the face is not in the world, since it opens and
exceeds the totality. This is why it marks the limit of all power, of all
violence, and the origin of the ethical. In a sense, murder is always
directed against the face, but thereby always misses it. "Murder exerts a
power over that which escapes power. Still, a power, for the face
expresses itself in the sensible; but already impotence, because the face rips
apart the sensible." "The Other is the only being who I may wish to kill,"
but the only one, also, who orders that "thou shalt commit no murders,"
and thus absolutely limits my power. Not by opposing me with another
force in the world, but by speaking to me, and by looking at me from an
other origin of the world, from that which no finite power can restrict:
the strange, unthinkable notion of unreal resistance. Since his 1953 article
(already cited), Levinas no longer, to our knowledge, speaks of
"intelligible resistance"-an expression whose sense still belongs at least
literally, to the realm of the same, and which was utilized, apparently, only
to signify an unreal resistance. In Totality and
Infinity Levinas speaks of "ethical resistance."
That which escapes the concept as power, therefore, is not existence in
general, but the existence of the Other. And first of all because,
despite all appearances, there is no concept of the Other. We would
have to reflect upon this word "Other" [Autrui] in an artisan-like way, in the
realm where philosophy and philology constrain each other, uniting
their concerns and their rigor-this word "Other" circumscribed in
silence by the capital letter which ever increases the neutrality of the
other, and which we use so familiarly, even though it is the very
disorder of our conceptuality. Is it only a common noun without
concept? But, first of all, is it a noun? It is not an adjective, or a
pronoun; therefore it is a substantive and such it is classed by the

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

language, that which is always "in regimen" and in the least generality
is, in its meaning, undeclinable and beyond genre. What is the origin
of this case of meaning in language, of this regimen in which language
places meaning? Nor is autrui a proper noun, even though its anonym
ity signifies but the unnamable source of every proper noun. We would
have to examine patiently what emerges in language when the Greek
conception of heteron seems to run out of breath when faced by the alterhuic;
what happens when the heteron seems to become incapable of mastering what
it alone, however, is able to precomprehend by concealing it as alterity
(other in general), and which, in return, will reveal to heteron its
irreducible center of meaning (the other as other [autrui]). We would
have to examine the complicity of the concealment and the
precomprehension which does not occur within a conceptual movement,
for the French word autrui does not designate a category of the genre autre.
We would have to examine this thought of the other in general (which is
not a genre), the Greek thought within which this nonspecific difference
realizes (itself in) our history. Or, rather: what does autre mean before its Greek
determination as heteron, and its JudeoChristian determination as autrui?
This is the kind of question which Levinas seems to contest profoundly:
according to him, only the irruption of the Other permits access to the
absolute and to the irreducible alterity of the other. We would have to
examine, therefore, this Huic of autrui whose transcendence is not yet that of a
thou. Here, Levinas's opposition to Buber or to Gabriel Marcel becomes
meaningful. After opposing the magisterial height of the You to the intimate
reciprocity of the Me-Thou (TI), Levinas seems to move toward a philosophy
of the Ille, of the He (11) in his meditation of the Trace (that is, of the neighbor
as a distant stranger, according to the original ambiguity of the word
translated as the "neighbor" to be loved). A philosophy of the He who
would not be an impersonal object opposed to the thou, but the invisible
transcendence of the Other." If the face's expression is not revelation, then
the unrevealable is expressed beyond all thematization, beyond all
constitutive analysis, all phenomenology. At its various stages, the

attempts to reassemble the description in the fifth of the Cartesian

ego, as a phenomenon of the ego, by and for a nomadic subject proceeding by appresentative analogy. All the difficulties encountered by
Husserl could be "surmounted" if the ethical relationship were recognized as the original face-to-face, as the emergence of absolute alterity, the
emergence of an exteriority which can be neither derived, nor
engendered, nor constituted on the basis of anything other than itself An
absolute outside, an exteriority infinitely overflowing the monad of the ego
cogito. Here again, Descartes against Husserl, the Descartes of the Third
Meditation allegedly misconstrued by Husserl. While Descartes, in his
reflections on the cogito, becomes aware that infinity not only cannot be
constituted as a (dubitable) object, but has already made infinity possible as
a cogito overflowing the object, (a nonspatial overflowing, against which
metaphor shatters), Husserl, on the other hand, "sees in the cogito a
subjectivity with no support from without, constituting the idea of
infinity itself, and providing himself with it as object" (TI). Now, the
infinite(-ly other) cannot be an object because it is speech, the origin of
meaning and the world. Therefore, no phenomenology can account for
ethics, speech, and justice.
But if all justice begins with speech, all speech is not just. Rhetoric may
amount to the violence of theory, which reduces the other when it leads the
other, whether through psychology, demagogy, or even pedagogy which is
not instruction. The latter descends from the heights of

theorem, is offered and exposed as denuding, as demanding supplication, as the unthinkable unity of a speech able to assist itself and a
glance which calls for assistance.
Asymmetry, non-light, and commandment then would be violence
and injustice themselves-and, indeed, so they are commonly
understood-if they established relations between finite beings, or if the
other was but a negative determination of the (finite or infinite) same. But
we have seen that this is not the case. Infinity (as infinitely other) cannot
be violent as is totality (which is thus always defined by Levinas, always
determined by an option, that is, an initial decision of his discourse, as
finite totality: totality, for Levinas, means a finite totality. This functions as
a silent axiom.) This is why God alone keeps Levinas's world from
being a world of the pure and worst violence, a world of immorality
itself. The structures of living and naked experience described by
Levinas are the very structures of a world in which war would ragestrange conditional-if the infinitely other were not infinity, if there were,
by chance, one naked man, finite and alone. But in this case, Levinas
would no doubt say, there no longer would be any war, for there would
be neither face nor true asymmetry. Therefore the naked and living
experience in which God has already begun to speak could no longer be
our concern. In other words, in a world where the face would be fully
respected (as that which is not of this world), there no longer would be
war. In a world where the face no longer would be absolutely respected,
where there no longer would be a face, there would be no more cause
for war. God, therefore, is implicated in war.

the master, whose absolute exteriority does not impair the disciple's
freedom. Beyond rhetoric, speech uncovers the nudity of the face,
without which no nudity would have any meaning. All nudity, "even
the nudity of the body experienced in shame," is a "figure of speech
quite explicit in is Ontology Fundamental? "The nudity of the face is not a
stylistic figure." And it is shown, still in the form of negative theology;
that this nudity is not even an opening, for an opening is relative to a
"surrounding plenitude." The word "nudity" thus destroys itself after
serving to indicate something beyond itself. An entire reading and
interrogation of Totality and Infinity could be developed around thi
affirmation. For this affirmation seems to us quite implicitly-perhaps
even too implicitly-to support the decisive division between what'
Levinas calls the face and that which is Beyond the Face, the section which
considers, aside from the Phenomenology of Eros, Love, Fecundity, and

His name too, like the name of peace, is a function within the system of
ar, the only system whose basis permits us to speak, the only system
hose language may ever be spoken. With or without God, there ould
be no war. War supposes and excludes God. We can have a
relation to God only within such a system. Therefore war-for war there isis the difference between the face and the finite world without a face. But is
not this difference that which has always been called the world, m which
the absence-presence of God plays? Only the play of the world permits us to
think the essence of God. In a sense that our language-and Levinas's alsoaccommodates poorly the play of the world precedes
God.

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

The face-to-face, then, is not originally determined by Levinas as the visa-vis of two equal and upright men. The latter supposes the face-toface of
the man with bent neck and eyes raised toward the God on high.
Language is indeed the possibility of the face-to-face and of beingupright, but it does not exclude inferiority, the humility of the glance at
the father as the glance of the child made in memory of having been
expulsed before knowing how to walk, and of having been delivered, prone
and infans, into the hands of the adult masters. Man, one might say, is a
God arrived too early, that is, a God who knows himself forever late in
relation to the already-there of Being. But it is certain that these last
remarks-and this is the least one might say-do not belong to the genre
of commentary. And we are not referring, here, to the themes known
under the name of psychoanalysis, nor to the embryological or
anthropological hypothesis on the structurally premature birth of man's
offspring. Let it suffice us to know that man is
born. 38
God's name is often mentioned, but this return to experience, and to
"things themselves," as a relation to the infinite(ly) other is not theological, even if it alone is capable, afterward, of founding theological
discourse, which up to now has "imprudently considered the idea of the
relationship between God and creation in ontological terms" (TI). The
foundation ofmetaphysics-in Levinas's sense-is to be encountered in the
return to things themselves, where we find the common root of
humanism and theology: the resemblance between man and God,

man's visage and the Face of God. "The Other resembles God" (ibid.). Via
the passageway of this resemblance, man's speech can be lifted up toward
God, an almost unheard of analogy which is the very movement of
Levinas's discourse on discourse. Analogy as dialogue with God:'
"Discourse is discourse with God.... Metaphysics is the essence of this
language with God." Discourse with God, and not in God as participation.
Discourse with God, and not discourse on God and his attributes as
theology. And the dissymetry of my relation to the other, this "curvature
of inter-subjective space signifies the divine intention of all truth." I
"is, perhaps, the very presence of God." Presence as separation,
presence-absence-again the break with Parmenides, Spinoza and

blance which is not the "ontological mark" of the worker imprinted on
his product, or on "beings created in his image and resemblance"
(Malebranche);39 a resemblance which can be understood neither in
terms of communion or knowledge, nor in terms of participation and
incarnation. A resemblance which is neither a sign nor an effect of
God. Neither the sign nor the effect exceeds the same. We are "in the
Trace of God." A proposition which risks incomparability with every
allusion to the "very presence of God." A proposition readily converted into
atheism: and if God was an effect of the trace? If the idea of divine presence (life,
existence, parousia, etc.), if the name of God was but the movement of
erasure of the trace in presence? Here it is a question of knowing whether
the trace permits us to think presence in its system, or whether the reverse
order is the true one. It is doubtless the true order. But it is indeed the order of
truth which is in question. Levinas's thought is maintained between these
two postulations.
The face of God disappears forever in showing itself Thus are
reassembled in the unity of their metaphysical signification, at the very
heart of the experience denuded by Levinas, the diverse evocations of the
Face of Yahweh, who of course is never named in Totality and Infinity. The face
of Yahweh is the total person and the total presence of "the Eternal
speaking face to face with Moses," but saying to him also: "Thou canst
not see my face: for there shall be no man see me and live.... thou
shalt stand upon a rock: and it shall come to pass, while my glory
passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee
with my hand while I pass by: And I will take away mine hand, and thou
shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen" (Exodus 33:2023). The face of God which commands while hiding itself is at once
more and less a face than all faces. Whence, perhaps, despite all Levinas's
precautions, the equivocal complicity of theology and metaphysics in
Totality and Infinity. Would Levinas subscribe to this infinitely ambiguous
sentence from the Book of Questions by Edmond

Jabes: "All faces are His; this is why HE has no face"?
The face is neither the face of God nor the figure of man: it is their
resemblance. A resemblance which, however, we must think before, or
without, the assistance of the Same.40

III DIFFERENCE AND ESCHATOLOGY
The questions whose principles we now will attempt to indicate are all, in
several senses, questions of language: questions of language and the
question of language. But if our commentary has not been too unfaithful, it
is already clear that there is no element of Levinas's thought which is
not, in and of itself, engaged by such questions.
Of the original polemic
First, let it be said, for our own reassurance: the route followed by
Levinas's thought is such that all our questions already belong to his
own interior dialogue, are displaced into his discourse and only listen
to it, from many vantage points and in many ways.
A. Thus, for example, De 1'existence a 1'existant and Le temps et l'autre seemed to
proscribe the "logic of genre," as well as the categories of the Same and
Other. These lacked the originality of the experience to which Levinas
wished to lead us back: "To the cosmos which is Plato's world is opposed
the world of the mind, in which the implications of eros are not reduced to
the logic of genre, in which the ego is substituted for the some, and Others
for the other." Now, in Totality and Infinity, where the
categories of Same and Other return in force, the vis demonstrandi and
very energy of the break with tradition is precisely the adequation of
Ego to the Same, and of Others to the Other. Without using these terms
themselves, Levinas often warned us against confusing identity and
ipseity, Same and Ego: idem and ipse. This confusion, which, in a certain
way, is immediately practiced by the Greek concept of autos and the
German concept of selbst, does not occur as spontaneously in French;
nevertheless, it returns as a kind of silent axiom in Totality and Infinity 41.
We have seen this: according to Levinas there would be no interior
difference, no fundamental and autochthonous alterity within the ego.
If, formerly, interiority, the secret and original separation, had permit
red the break with the classical use of the Greek concepts of Same and
Other, the amalgamation of Same and Ego (Same and Ego horriogen
ized, and homogenized with the concept, as well as with the finite
totality) now permits Levinas to include within the same condemna

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS 137

Lion both the Greek and the most modern philosophies of subjectivity,
the philosophies most careful to distinguish, as did Levinas previously,
the Ego from the Same and Others from the other. Without close
attention to this double movement, to this progress which seems to
contest its own condition and its own initial stage, we would miss the
originality of this protest against the concept, the state and totality: it is not
made, as is generally the case, in the name of subjective existence, but
against it. Simultaneously against Hegel and against Kierkegaard.
Levinas often warns us against confusing-as one is so tempted to dohis anti-Hegelianism with a subjectivism, or with a Kierkegaardian type of
existentialism, both of which would remain, according to Levinas,
violent and premetaphysical egoisms. "It is not I who do not accept the
system, as Kierkegaard thought, it is the other." Can one not wager that
Kierkegaard would have been deaf to this distinction? And that he, in turn,
would have protested against this conceptuality? It as subjective existence,
he would have remarked perhaps, that the other does not accept the
system. The other is not myself-and who has ever maintained that it is?-but
it is an Ego, as Levinas must suppose in order to maintain his own discourse.
The passage from Ego to other as an Ego is the passage to the essential, nonempirical egoity of subjective existence in general. The philosopher Kierkegaard
does not only plead for Soren Kierkegaard, ("the egoistic cry of a subjectivity
still concerned with Kierkegaard's happiness or salvation"), but for
subjective existence in general (a noncontradictory expression); this is why
his discourse is philosophical, and not in the realm of empirical egoism.
The name of a philosophical subject, when he says I, is always, in a certain
way, a pseudonym. This is a truth that Kierkegaard adopted systematically,
even while protesting against the "possibilization" of individual existence
which resists the concept. And is not this essence of subjective existence
presupposed by the respect for the other, which can be what it is-the otheronly as subjective existence? In order to reject the Kierkegaardian notion of
subjective existence Levinas should eliminate even the notions of an essence
and a truth of subjective existence (of the Ego, and primarily of the Ego of
the Other). Moreover, this gesture would comply with the logic of the
break with phenomenology and ontology. The least one might say is that
Levinas does not do so, and cannot do so, without renouncing philosophical
discourse. And, if you

138 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

will, the attempt to achieve an opening toward the beyond of philosophical discourse, by means of philosophical discourse, which can
never be shaken off completely, cannot possibly succeed within
language-and Levinas recognizes that there is no thought before language
and outside of it-except by formally and thematically posing the question of the
relations between belonging and the opening, the question of closure. Formally-that is
by posing it in the most effective and most formal, the most
formalized, way possible: not in a logic, in other words in a philosophy,
but in an inscribed description, in an inscription of the relations
between the philosophical and the nonphilosophical, in a kind of
unheard of graphics, within which philosophical conceptuality would be no
more than a function.
Let us add, in order to do him justice, that Kierkegaard had a sense of the
relationship to the irreducibility of the totally-other, not in the egoistic
and esthetic here and now, but in the religious beyond of the concept, in
the direction of a certain Abraham. And did he not, in turn-for we
must let the other speak-see in Ethics, as a moment of Category and
Law, the forgetting, in anonymity, of the subjectivity of religion? From his
point of view, the ethical moment is Hegelianism itself, and he says so
explicitly. Which does not prevent him from reaffirming ethics in
repetition, and from reproaching Hegel for not having constituted a
morality. It is true that Ethics, in Levinas's sense, is an Ethics without law
and without concept, which maintains its nonviolent purity only before
being determined as concepts and laws. This is not an objection: let us not
forget that Levinas does not seek to propose laws or moral rules, does
not seek to determine a morality, but rather the essence of the ethical
relation in general. But as this determination does not offer itself as a
theory of Ethics, in question then, is an Ethics of Ethics. In this case, it is
perhaps serious that this Ethics of Ethics can occasion neither a determined
ethics nor determined laws without negating and forgetting itself
Moreover, is this Ethics of Ethics beyond all laws? Is it not the Law of
laws? A coherence which breaks down the coherence of the discourse
against coherence-the infinite concept, hidden within the protest against
the concept.
If juxtaposition with Kierkegaard has often imposed itself upon us,
despite the author's own admonitions, we are certain that as concerns
the essential in its initial inspiration Levinas's protest against

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

139

Hegelianism is foreign to Kierkegaard's protest. Inversely, a confrontation
of Levinas's thought with Feuerbach's anti-Hegelianism would
necessarily uncover, it seems to us, more profound convergences and
affinities that the meditation of the Trace would confirm further still. We are
speaking here of convergences, and not of influences; primarily because the
latter is a notion whose philosophical meaning is not clear to us; and next
because, to our knowledge, Levinas nowhere alludes to Feuerbach or to
Jaspers.
But why does Levinas return to categories he seemed to have rejected
previously in attempting this very difficult passage beyond the debatewhich is also a complicity-between Hegelianism and classical antiHegelianism?
We are not denouncing, here, an incoherence of language or a contradiction in the system. We are wondering about the meaning of a
necessity: the necessity of lodging oneself within traditional conceptuality
in order to destroy it. Why did this necessity finally impose itself upon
Levinas? Is it an extrinsic necessity? Does it not touch upon only an
instrument, only an "expression," which can be put between quotation
marks? Or does it hide, rather, some indestructible and unforeseeable
resource of the Greek logos? Some unlimited power of envelopment, by
which he who attempts to repel it would always
already be overtaken?
B. During the same period, Levinas had expelled the concept of exteriority.
The latter referred to an enlightened unity of space which neutralized
radical alterity: the relation to the other, the relation of Instants to each
other, the relation to Death, etc.-all of which are not relations of an Inside
to an Outside. "The relation with the other is a relation with a Mystery. It is
the other's exteriority, or rather his alterity, for exteriority is a property
of space, and brings the subject back to himself through the light
which constitutes his entire being" (TA). Now Totality and Infinity, subtitled
Essay on Exteriority, does not only abundantly employ the notion of exteriority.
Levinas also intends to show that true exteriority is not spatial, for space is the
Site of the Same. Which means that the Site is always a site of the Same. Why
is it necessary still to use the word "exteriority" (which, if it has a meaning,
if it is not an algebraic X, obstinately beckons toward space and light)
in order to signify a

1 4 0 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
nonspatial relationship? And if every "relationship" is spatial, why is it
necessary still to designate as a (nonspatial) "relationship" the respect
which absolves the other? Why is it necessary to obliterate this notion of
exteriority without erasing it, without making it illegible, by stating that
its truth is its untruth, that true exteriority is not spatial, that is, is not
exteriority? That it is necessary to state infinity's excess over totality in the
language of totality; that it is necessary to state the other in the language
of the Same; that it is necessary to think true exteriority as nonexteriority, that
is, still by means of the Inside-Outside structure and by spatial metaphor; and
that it is necessary still to inhabit the metaphor in ruins, to dress oneself in
tradition's shreds and the devil's patches-all this means, perhaps, that
there is no philosophical logos which must not first let itself be
expatriated into the structure Inside-Outside. This

deportation from its own site toward the Site, toward spatial locality is the
metaphor congenital to the philosophical logos. Before being a rhetorical
procedure within language, metaphor would be the emergence of
language itself And philosophy is only this language; in the best of
only speak it, state the metaphor itself, which amounts to thinking the
metaphor within the silent horizon of the nonmetaphor: Being. Space
being the wound and finitude of birth (of the birth) without which one
could not even open language, one would not even have a true or false "
exteriority to speak of Therefore, one can, by using them, use up tradi-?
tion's words, rub them like a rusty and devalued old coin; one can say,,
that true exteriority is nonexteriority without being interiority, and
one can write by crossing out, by crossing out what already has been
crossed out: for crossing out writes, still draws in space. The syntax of

ously, at the very heart of conceptuality itself This is because they do
n signify an immersion in space. The structure Inside-Outside or
n
Day-Night has no meaning in a pure space given over to itself and
disoriented. It emerges on the basis of an included origin, an inscribed
eastern horizon which is neither within nor without space. This text of
the glance is also the text of speech. Therefore it can be called Face. But
one must not expect, henceforth, to separate language and space, to
empty language of space, to snatch speech away from light, to speak
while a Hand hides Glory. In vain would one exile any given word
("inside," "outside," "exterior," "interior," etc.), and in vain would
one burn or emprison the letters of light, for language in its entirety
already has awakened as a fall into light. That is, if you will, language
arises with the sun. Even if "the sun is never named... its power is in our
midst" (Saint-John Perse). To say that the infinite exteriority of the other is
not spatial, is non-exteriority and non-interiority, to be unable to designate it
otherwise than negatively-is this not to acknowledge that the infinite (also
mount to acknowledging that
the structure "inside-outside," which is language itself, marks the original
finitude of speech and of whatever befalls it? No philosophical language
will ever be able to reduce the naturality of a spatial praxis in
language; and one would have to meditate the unity of Leibniz's disUnction between "civil language" and "scholarly" or philosophical
language. And here one would have to meditate even more patiently

1 4 2 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
it seems to us, has attempted this more profoundly than Hegel. Without
naively using the category of chance, of happy predestination or of the
chance encounter, one would have to do for each concept what Hegel
does for the German notion of Aufhebung, whose equivocality and presence in
the German language he calls delightful: "Aufheben has in the German
language a double sense: that of preserving, maintaining, and that of leaving
off, bringing to an end. To preserve, moreover, has a negative sense....
Lexicologically, these two determinations of the Aufheben may be
considered as two meanings of the word. It is remarkable that a language
comes to use one and the same word to express two opposed meanings.
Speculative thought is delighted [my italics] to find in language words which by
themselves have a speculative sense; the German language possesses several
of these" (Wissenschaft der Logik 1, pp. I 24-2S). In the Vorlesungen fiber die
Philosophie der Geschichte (Lectures on the Philosophy of History) Hegel also notes that
the union of two meanings (historia rerun gestarum and res fiestas) of the word
Geschichte "in our language" is not a "simple exterior contingency."
Henceforth, if I cannot designate the (infinite) irreducible alterity of the
Other except through the negation of (finite) spatial exteriority, perhaps
the meaning of this alterity is finite, is not positively infinite. The infinitely
other, the infinity of the other, is not the other as a positive infinity, as
God, or as resemblance with God. The infinitely Other would not be what
it is, other, if it was a positive infinity, and if it did not maintain within
itself the negativity of the indefinite, of the apeiron. Does not "infinitely
other" primarily signify that which does not come to an end, despite my
interminable labor and experience? Can one respect the Other as Other,
and expel negativity-labor-from transcendence, as Levinas seeks to do?
The positive Infinity (God)-if these words are meaningful-cannot be
infinitely Other. If one thinks, as Levinas does, that positive Infinity
tolerates, or even requires, infinite alterity, then one must renounce all
language, and first of all the words infinite and other. Infinity cannot be
understood as Other except in the form of the in-finite. As soon as one
attempts to think Infinity as a positive plenitude (one pole of Levinas's
nonnegative transcendence), the other becomes unthinkable, impossible,
unutterable. Perhaps Levinas calls us toward this unthinkable-impossibleunutterable beyond (tradition's) Being and Logos. But it must not be
possible

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

either to think or state this call. In any event, that the positive plenitude of
classical infinity is translated into language only by betraying itself in a
negative word (in-finite), perhaps situates, in the most profound way,
the point where thought breaks with language. A break which
afterward will but resonate throughout all language. This is why the
modern philosophies which no longer seek to distinguish between
thought and language, nor to place them in a hierarchy, are essentially
philosophies of original finitude. But then they should be able to abandon
the word "finitude," forever prisoner of the classical framework. Is this
possible? And what does it mean to abandon a classical notion?
The otlrer cannot be what it is, infinitely other, except in finitude and
mortality (mine and its). It is such as soon as it comes into language, of
course, and only then, and only if the word other has a meaning-but
has not Levinas taught us that there is no thought before language? This is
why our questions certainly would be less bothersome for a classical
infinitism of the Cartesian type, for example, which would dissociate
thought and language, the latter never going as fast or as far as the
former. Not only would these questions be less bothersome for a classical
infinitism, but they could be its own questions. In another way: to
neutralize space within the description of the other, in order thereby to
liberate positive infinity-is this not to neutralize the essential finitude of a
face (glance-speech) which is a body, and not, as Levinas continually insists,
the corporeal metaphor of etherealized thought? Body: that is, also
exteriority, locality in the fully spatial, literally spatial, meaning of the
word; a zero point, the origin of space, certainly, but an origin which
has no meaning before the of, an origin inseparable from genitivity and
from the space that it engenders and orients: an inscribed origin. The
inscription is the written origin: traced and henceforth inscribed in a system,
in a figure which it no longer governs. Without which there no longer
would be a body proper to oneself. If the face of the other was not also,
irreducibly, spatial exteriority, we would still have to distinguish between
soul and body, thought and speech; or better, between a true, nonspatial
face, and its mask or metaphor, its spatial figure. The entire Metaphysics
of the Face would collapse. Again, this question could be derived as much
from a classical infinitism (duality of thought and language, but also of
thought and body) as from the most modern philosophy of finitude.
This strange alliance in the

143

144

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

question perhaps signifies that within philosophy and within language,
within philosophical discourse (supposing there are any others), one cannot
simultaneously save the themes of positive infinity and of the face (the
nonmetaphorical unity of body, glance, speech, and thought). This last
unity, it seems to us, can be thought only within the horizon of infinite
(indefinite) alterity as the irreducibly common horizon of Death and
the Other. The horizon of finitude or the finitude of the horizon.
But, let us repeat, all this within philosophical discourse, where the thought of
Death itself (without metaphor) and the thought of a positive Infinity have
never been able to understand each other. If the face is body, it is mortal.
Infinite alterity as death Cannot be reconciled with infinite alterity as
positivity and presence (God). Metaphysical transcendence cannot be at
once transcendence toward the other as Death and transcendence
towards the other as God. Unless God means Death, which after all has
never been excluded by the entirety of the classical philosophy within
which we understand God both as Life and as the Truth of Infinity, of
positive Presence. But what does this exclusion mean if not the exclusion of
every particular determination? And that God is nothing (determined), is not
life, because he is everything? and therefore is at once All and Nothing, Life
and Death. Which means that God is or appears, is named, within the
difference between All and Nothing, Life and Death. Within difference, and at
bottom as Difference itself. This difference is what is called History. God is
inscribed in it.
It will be said that Levinas stands opposed to precisely this kind of
philosophical discourse. But in this combat, he already has given up the best
weapon: disdain of discourse. In effect, when confronted by the . classical
difficulties of language we are referring to, Levinas cannot provide himself
with the classical resources against them. At arms with the problems which
were equally the problems of negative theology and of Bergsonism, he
does not give himself the right to speak, as they did, in a language resigned
to its own failure. Negative theology was spoken in a speech that knew
itself failed and finite, inferior to logos as God's understanding. Above all,
negative theology never undertook a Discourse with God in the face to face,
and breath to breath, of two free speeches; and this despite the humility and
the haughtiness of breaking off, or undertaking, the exchange. Analogously,
Bergson had the right to announce the intuition of duration, and to
denounce intellectual

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

spatialization, within a language given over to space. It was not a ques
tion of saving, but of destroying discourse within "metaphysics," the
science which allegedly does without symbols" (Bergson). Antagon
istic metaphors were multiplied systematically in this autodestruction
of language which advocated silent metaphysical intuition. Language
being defined as a historical residue, there was no contradiction in
utilizing it, for better or for worse, in order to denounce its own
betrayal, and then to abandon it to its own insufficiency as rhetorical
refuse, speech lost to metaphysics. Like negative theology, a philosophy of
intuitive communion gave itself the right (correctly or incorrectly,
another problem) to travel through philosophical discourse as through a
foreign medium. But what happens when this right is no longer given,
when the possibility of metaphysics is the possibility of speech? When
metaphysical responsibility is responsibility for language, because
"thought consists of speaking" (TI), and metaphysics is a language with
God? How to think the other, if the other can be spoken only as
exteriority and through exteriority, that is, nonalterity? And if the speech
which must inaugurate and maintain absolute separation is by its essence
rooted in space, which cannot conceive separation and absolute alterity? If,
as Levinas says, only discourse (and not intuitive contact) is righteous, and
if, moreover, all discourse essentially retains within it space and the Same
does this not mean that discourse is originally violent? And that the
philosophical logos, the only one in which peace may be declared, is
inhabited by war? The distinction between discourse and violence42 always
will be an inaccessible horizon. Nonviolence would be the telos, and not the
essence of discourse. Perhaps it will be said that something like discourse
has its essence in its telos, and the presence of its present in its future. This
certainly is so, but on the condition that its future and its telos be
nondiscourse: peace as a certain silence, a certain beyond of speech, a certain
possibility, a certain silent horizon of speech. And telos has always had the
form of presence, be it a future presence. There is war only after the opening
of discourse, and war dies out only at the end of discourse. Peace, like
silence, is the strange vocation of a language called outside itself by itself
But since finite silence is also the medium of violence, language can only
indefinitely tend toward justice by acknowledging and practicing the
violence within it. Violence against violence. Economy of

146

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

violence. An economy irreducible to what Levinas envisions in the
word. If light is the element of violence, one must combat light with a
certain other light, in order to avoid the worst violence, the violence of the
night which precedes or represses discourse. This vigilance is a
violence chosen as the least violence by a philosophy which takes history,
that is, finitude, seriously; a philosophy aware of itself as historical in
each of its aspects (in a sense which tolerates neither finite totality, nor
positive infinity), and aware of itself, as Levinas says in another sense, as
economy. But again, an economy which in being history, can be at home
neither in the finite totality which Levinas calls the Same nor in the
positive presence of the Infinite. Speech is doubtless the first defeat of

violence, but paradoxically, violence did not exist before the possibility of
speech. The philosopher (man) must speak and write within this war of
light, a war in which he always already knows himself to be engaged;
a war which he knows is inescapable, except by denying discourse,
that is, by risking the worst violence. This is why this avowal of the war
within discourse, an avowal which is not yet peace, signifies the opposite
of bellicosity; the bellicosity-and who has shown this
better than Hegel?-whose best accomplice within history is irenics. Within
history which the philosopher cannot escape, because it is not history in
the sense given to it by Levinas (totality), but is the history of the
departures from totality, history as the very movement of transcendence, of
the excess over the totality without which no totality would

Of transcendental violence

In addition, metaphysics, unable to escape its ancestry in light, always
supposes a phenomenology in its very critique of phenomenology, and
especially if, like Levinas's metaphysics, it seeks to be discourse and
instruction.

A. Does metaphysics suppose this phenomenology only as a method, as
a technique, in the strict sense of these words? Although he rejects the
majority of the literal results of Husserl's researches, Levinas keeps to the
methodological inheritance: "The presentation and development of the
notions employed owes everything to the phenomenological method"
(TI; DL). But are not the presentation and development of ideas but the
vestments of thought? And can a method be borrowed, like a tool?
Thirty years earlier, in the wake of Heidegger, did not Levinas
maintain that method cannot be isolated? For method always shelters,
especially in Husserl's case, "an anticipated view of the 'sense' of the being
which one encounters" (THI). Levinas wrote at this time: "Consequently,
in our exposition we cannot separate the theory of intuition, as a
philosophical method, from what might be called Husserl's ontology"
(THI).
Now, what the phenomenological method refers to, explicitly and in the
last analysis (and this would be too easy to show), is Western
philosophy's very decision, since Plato, to consider itself as science, as
theory: that is, precisely as that which Levinas wishes to put into
question by the ways and means of phenomenology.

appear as such. History is not the totality transcended by eschatology,
metaphysics, or speech. It is transcendence itself. If speech is a move
ment of metaphysical transcendence, it is history, and not beyond
history. It is difficult to think the origin of history in a perfectly finite
totality (the Same), as well as, moreover, in a perfectly positive infinity;
If, in this sense, the movement of metaphysical transcendence is his
tory, it is still violent, for-and this is the legitimate truism from which
Levinas always draws inspiration-history is violence. Metaphysics' is
economy: violence against violence, light against light: philosophy (in
general). About which it can be said, by transposing Claudel's inten
tion, that everything in it "is painted on light as if with condensed
light, like the air which becomes frost." This becoming is war. T
polemic is language itself. Its inscription.

B. Beyond its method, the aspect of "Husserl's essential teaching" (TI)
which Levinas intends to retain is not only its supple and necessary
descriptions, the fidelity to the meaning of experience, but also the
concept of intentionality. An intentionality enlarged beyond its repre
sentative and theoretical dimension, beyond the noetico-noematical
structure which Husserl incorrectly would have seen as the primordial
structure. Repression of the infinite would have kept Husserl from
access to the true depths of intentionality as desire and as metaphysical
transcendence toward the other beyond phenomenality or Being. This
repression would occur in two ways.

1 4 8 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
On the one hand, in the value of adequation. As vision and theoretical
intuition, Husserlian intentionality would be adequation. This latter
would exhaust and interiorize all distance and all true alterity. "Vision, in
effect, is essentially an adequation of exteriority to interiority: exteriority is
reabsorbed in the contemplating soul, and, as an adequate idea, is revealed a
priori, resulting in a Sinngebung" (TI). Now, "intentionality, in which thought
remains adequation to its object, does not define ... consciousness at its
fundamental level." Certainly Husserl is not named here, at the very
moment when Levinas speaks of intentionality as adequation; one may
always suppose that by the expression "intentionality, in which thought
remains adequation," Levinas means "an intentionality such that, etc., an
intentionality in which at least, etc." But the context, numerous other
passages and the allusion to the Sinngebung, all clearly indicate that
Husserl, in the letter of his texts, was unable to recognize that "as
intentionality all knowledge already supposes the idea of infinity, which
is adequation par excellence" (TI). Thus, supposing that Husserl had
foreseen the infinite horizons which overflow objectivity and adequate
intuition, he would have interpreted them, literally, as "thoughts aiming
at objects": "What does it matter if in Husserlian phenomenology,
understood literally, these unsuspected horizons are interpreted, in turn,
as thoughts aiming at objects!" (cited above).
On the other hand, supposing that the Husserlian Cogito opened onto the
infinite, according to Levinas, it would open onto an objectinfinity, an
infinity without alterity, a false infinity: "If Husserl sees in the cogito a
subjectivity with no support outside itself, he is constituting the idea of
infinity itself, giving it to himself as an object." The "false-infinity," a
Hegelian expression which Levinas never uses, nevertheless seems to
us, perhaps because it is Hegelian, to haunt numerous gestures of
denunciation in Totality and Infinity. As it was for Hegel, the "false-infinity"
for Levinas would be the indefinite, negative form of infinity. But, since
Levinas conceives true alterity as nonnegativity (nonnegative
transcendence), he can make the other the true infinity, and make the
same (in strange complicity with negativity) the

false-infinity. Which would have seemed absolutely mad to Hegel (and to all
the metaphysics expanded and rethought in him): how can alterity be
separated from negativity, how can alterity be separated from the

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS 1 4 9

"false infinity"? Or inversely, how could absolute sameness not be
infinity? If, as Levinas says, the same is a violent totality, this would
mean that it is a finite totality, and therefore is abstract, more other than
the other (than an other totality), etc. The same as finite totality would
not be the same, but still the other. Levinas would be speaking of the other
under the rubric of the same, and of the same under the rubric of the
other, etc. If the finite totality was the same, it could not be thought, or
posed as such, without becoming other than itself (and this is war). If it
did not do so, it could not enter into war with others (finite totalities),
nor could it be violent. Henceforth, not being violent, it would not be the
same in Levinas's sense (finite totality). Entering into war-and war there isit is conceived, certainly, as the other's other, that is, it gains access to the
other as an other (self). But again, it is no longer a totality in Levinas's
sense. In this language, which is the only language of Western philosophy,
can one not repeat Hegelianism, which is only this language coming into
absolute possession of itself?
Under these conditions, the only effective position to take in order not
to be enveloped by Hegel would seem to be, for an instant, the
following: to consider the false-infinity (that is, in a profound way,
original finitude) irreducible. Perhaps this is what Husserl does, at
bottom, by demonstrating the irreducibility of intentional incompleteness, and therefore of alterity; and by showing that since consciousness is irreducible, it can never possibly, by its own essence,
become self-consciousness, nor be reassembled absolutely close to itself
in the parousia of an absolute knowledge. But can this be said, can one think
the "false infinity" as such (time, in a word), can one pause alongside it
as alongside the truth of experience, without already (an already which
permits us to think time!) having let the true infinity, which then must be
recognized as such, be indicated, presented, thought and stated? What
we call philosophy, which perhaps is not the entirety of thought, cannot
think die false, nor even choose the false, without paying homage to the
anteriority and the superiority of the true (same relationship between
the other and the same). This last question, which indeed could be
Levinas's question to Husserl, would demonstrate that as soon as he speaks
against Hegel, Levinas can only confirm Hegel, has confirmed him already.
But is there a more rigorously and, especially, a more literally

150

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

Husserlian theme than the theme of inadequation? Of the infinite
overflowing of horizons? Who was more obstinately determined than
Husserl to show that vision was originally and essentially the inadequation
of interiority and exteriority? And that the perception of the transcendent
and extended thing was essentially and forever incomplete? That
immanent perception occurred within the infinite horizon of the flux of
experience? (cf, for example, Ideas 1, paragraph 83, passim). And above all,
who better than Levinas first gave us to understand these Husserlian
themes? Therefore, it is not a question of recalling their existence, but of
asking whether Husserl finally summarized inadequation, and reduced the
infinite horizons of experience to the condition of available objects. And
whether he did so by the secondary interpretation of which Levinas accuses
him.
We can hardly believe so. In the two intentional directions of which we
have just spoken, the Idea in the Kantian sense designates the infinite
overflowing of a horizon which, by reason of an absolute and essential
necessity which itself is absolutely principled and irreducible, never can
become an object itself, or be completed, equaled, by the intuition of
an object. Even by God's intuition. The horizon itself cannot become an
object because it is the unobjectifiable wellspring of every object in
general. This impossibility of adequation is so radical that neither the
originality nor the apodicticity of evident truths are necessarily adequations. (Cf,
for example, Ideas I, sec. 3; Cartesian Meditations, sec. 9, passim.)

(Of course, this does not imply that certain possibilities of adequate
evident truths-particular and founded ones-are overlooked by
Husserl.) The importance of the concept of horizon lies precisely in its
inability to make any constitutive act into an object, and in that it
the work of objectification to infinity. In phenomenology there is never
a constitution of horizons, but horizons of constitution. That the infin
ity of the Husserlian horizon has the form of an indefinite opening,
and that it offers itself without any possible end to the negativity of
constitution (of the work of objectification) does this not certainly
keep it from all totalization, from the illusion of the immediate pres
ence ence of a plenitudinous infinity in which the other suddenly becomes
unfindable? If a consciousness of infinite inadequation to the infinite
(and even to the finite) distinguishes a body of thought careful to
respect exteriority, it is difficult to see how Levinas can depart from'",;;

Husserl, on this point at least. Is not intentionality respect itself? The
eternal irreducibility of the other to the same, but of the other appearing as
other for the same? For without the phenomenon of other as other no
respect would be possible. The phenomenon of respect supposes the
respect of phenomenality. And ethics, phenomenology.
In this sense, phenomenology is respect itself, the development and
becoming-language of respect itself This was Husserl's aim in stating that
reason does not tolerate being distinguished into theoretical, practical, etc.
(cff above). This does not mean that respect as ethics is derived from
phenomenology, that it supposes phenomenology as its premise, or as a
previous or superior value. The presupposition of phenomenology is of
a unique kind. It "commands" nothing, in the worldly (real, political, etc.)
sense of commandment. It is the very neutralization of this kind of
commandment. But it does not neutralize the worldly type of
commandment in order to substitute another type of commandment for
it. It is profoundly foreign to all hierarchies. Which is to say that ethics
not only is neither dissipated in phenomenology nor submitted to it, but
that ethics finds within phenomenology its own meaning, its freedom and
radicality. Moreover, it seems incontestable to us that the themes of
nonpresence (temporalization and alterity) contradict that which makes
phenomenology a metaphysics of presence, working it ceaselessly, and we
emphasize this elsewhere.

C. Can Levinas separate himself from Husserl more legitimately as
concerns theoretism and the primacy of the consciousness of the
object? Let us not forget that the "primacy" necessarily in question
here is that of the object or of objectivity in general. Now phenomenology has surely contributed nothing if not an infinite renewal,
enlargement, and suppling of the notion of object in general. The
ultimate jurisdiction of evident truths is infinitely open, is open for
every type of possible object, that is, for every conceivable sense present
for consciousness in general. No discourse (for example, the discourse
in Totality and infinity which seeks to reawaken ethical truths to their
absolute independence, etc.) could be meaningful, could be thought
or understood, if it did not draw upon this layer of phenomenological
evidence in general. It suffices that ethical meaning be
Nought in order for Husserl to be right. Not only nominal definitions

1 5 2 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
but, before them, possibilities of essence which guide all concepts, are
presupposed when one speaks of ethics, of transcendence, of infinity, etc.
These expressions must have a meaning for concrete consciousness in
general, or no discourse and no thought would be possible. This domain
of absolutely "prior" truths is the domain of the transcendental
phenomenology in which a phenomenology of ethics must take root. This
rooting is not real, does not signify a real dependence; it would be vain
to reproach transcendental phenomenology for being in fact incapable of
engendering ethical values or behaviors (or, amounting to the same thing
for being able to repress them, more or less directly). Since every
determined meaning, every thought meaning, every noema (for example,
the meaning of ethics) supposes the possibility of noerna in general, it is fitting
to begin rightfully with transcendental phenomenology. To begin rightfully
with the general possibility of a noema which-let us recall this decisive
point-is not a real (reell) moment for Husserl, and therefore is without
any real (hierarchical or other) relationship to anything else: anything else
being capable of conception only in noematicity. In particular, this
means that from Husserl's point of view ethics in fact, in existence and in
history, could

not be subordinated to transcendental neutralization, nor be submitted to it in
any way. Neither ethics, nor anything else in the world, moreover.
Transcendental neutralization is in principle, by its meaning, foreign to all
factuality, all existence in general. In fact it is neither before nor after
ethics. Neither before nor after anything that is.
Thus, one may speak of ethical objectivity, or of ethical values or
imperatives as objects (noemas) with all their originality, without
reducing this objectivity to any of those which incorrectly (but the
fault is not Husserl's) function as the model for what commonly is
understood as objectivity (theoretical objectivity, political, technical,, s
natural, etc. objectivity). Truthfully, there are two meanings of the-'
aims at; and the more hidden sense in which appearance in general i s
maintained, including the appearance of the nontheoretical (in the first
sense) in particular. In this second sense, phenomenology is indeed a
theoretism, but it is so in the extent to which all thought and all
language are tied to theoretism, de facto and de jute. Phenomenology.
measures this extent. I know the meaning of the nontheoretical as

such (for example, ethics or the metaphysical in Levinas's sense), with a
theoretical knowledge (in general), and I respect it as such, as what it is, in
its meaning. I have regard 43 for recognizing that which cannot be
regarded as a thing, as a facade, as a theorem. I have regard for the face
itself
D. But, as we know, the fundamental disagreement between Levinas
eand Husserl is not here. Nor does it bear upon the ahistoricity of
meaning with which Levinas formerly reproached Husserl, and concerning which the latter had "held in store surprises" (as Levinas's
eschatology was to surprise us thirty years later in speaking "from beyond
the totality or history" TI). Which supposes, once more, that the
totality
is finite (a supposition in no w a y inscribed in its concept), that history
as such can be a finite totality, and that there is no history beyond the
finite totality. Perhaps one would have to show, as was suggested above, that
history is impossible, meaningless, in the finite totality, and that it is
impossible, meaningless, in the positive and actual infinity; that history
keeps to the difference between totality and infinity, and that history
precisely is that which Levinas calls transcendence and eschatology. A
system is neither finite nor infinite. A structural totality escapes this alternative
in its functioning. It escapes the archaeological and the eschatological, and
inscribes them in itself
The disagreement appears definite as concerns the Other. As we
have seen: according to Levinas, by making the other, notably in the
Cartesian Meditations, the ego's phenomenon, constituted by analogical
appresentation on the basis of belonging to the ego's own sphere,
Husserl allegedly missed the infinite alterity of the other, reducing it to the
same. To make the other an alter ego, Levinas says frequently, is to
neutralize its absolute alterity.

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

very form of the encounter 44 described by Levinas), impossible to respect
it in experience and in language, if this other, in its alterity, does not
appear for an ego (in general). One could neither speak, nor have any
sense of the totally other, if there was not a phenomenon of the totally
other, or evidence of the totally other as such. No one more than Husserl
has been sensitive to the singular and irreducible style of this evidence,
and to the original non-phenomenalization indicated within it. Even if
one neither seeks nor is able to thematize the other of which one does not
speak, but to whom one speaks, this impossibility and this imperative
themselves can be thematized (as Levinas does) only on the basis of a
certain appearance of the other as other for an ego. Husserl speaks of
this system, of this appearance, and of the impossibility of thematizing the
other in person. This is his problem: "They, (the other egos) however, are
not simple representations or objects represented within me, synthetic
unities of a process of verification taking place 'within me,' but precisely
'others' ... 'subjects for this same world ... subjects who perceive the
world ... and who thereby
experience me, just as I experience the world and in it, 'others' "
(Cartesian Meditations). It is this appearance of the other as that which I
can never be, this originary nonphenomenality, which is examined as
the ego's intentional phenomenon.
(b) For-and here we are keeping to the most manifest and most
massively incontestable meaning of the fifth of the Cartesian Meditations

whose course is so mazelike-Husserl's most central affirmation con
cerns the irreducibly mediate nature of the intentionality aiming at the
other as other. It is evident, by an essential, absolute and definitive self
evidence that the other as transcendental other (other absolute origin
and other zero point in the orientation of the world), can never be
given to me in an original way and in person, but only through ana

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

translates the recognition of the radical separation of the absolute origins,
the relationship of absolved absolutes and nonviolent respect for the
secret: the opposite of victorious assimilation.
Bodies, transcendent and natural things, are others in general for my
consciousness. They are outside, and their transcendence is the sign of an
already irreducible alterity. Levinas does not think so; Husserl does, and
thinks that "other" already means something when things are in
question. Which is to take seriously the reality of the external world.
Another sign of this alterity in general, which things share here with
others, is that something within them too is always hidden, and is
indicated only by anticipation, analogy and appresentation. Husserl states
this in the fifth of the Cartesian Meditations: analogical appresentation
belongs, to a certain extent, to every perception. But in the case of the other as
transcendent thing, the principled possibility of an originary and original
presentation of the hidden visage is always open, in principle and a priori.
This possibility is absolutely rejected in the case of Others. The alterity of the
transcendent thing, although already irreducible, is such only by means of
the indefinite incompleteness of my original perceptions. Thus it is
incomparable to the alterity of Others, which is also irreducible, and adds to
the dimension of incompleteness (the body of the Other in space, the
history of our relations, etc.) a more profound dimension of
nonoriginality-the radical impossibility of going around to see things from
the other side. But without the first alterity, the alterity of bodies (and the
Other is also a body, from the beginning), the second alterity could
never emerge. The system of these two alterities, the one inscribed in
the other, must be thought together: the alterity of others, therefore, by a
double power of indefiniteness. The stranger is infinitely other because by
his essence no enrichment of his profile can give me the subjective face of
his experience from his perspective, such as he has lived it. Never will this
experience be given to me originally, like everything which is mir eigenes,

the unsurpassable necessity of (nonobjective) mediation. If I did not
approach the other by way of analogical appresentation, if I attained to,

proper to me. This transcendence of the nonproper no longer is that of
the entirety, always inaccessible on the basis of always partial attempts:
transcendence of Infinity, not of Totality.
Levinas and Husserl are quite close here. But by acknowledging in
this infinitely other as such (appearing as such) the status of an inten
tional modification of the ego in general, Husserl gives himself the right

156

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

to speak of the infinitely other as such, accounting for the origin and the
legitimacy of his language. He describes the phenomenal system of
nonphenornenality. Levinas in fact speaks of the infinitely other, but by
refusing to acknowledge an intentional modification of the egowhich would be a violent and totalitarian act for him-he deprives
himself of the very foundation and possibility of his own language.
What authorizes him to say "infinitely other" if the infinitely other does not
appear as such in the zone he calls the same, and which is the neutral level of
transcendental description? To return, as to the only possible point of
departure, to the intentional phenomenon in which the other appears as
other, and lends itself to language, to every possible language, is perhaps to give
oneself over to violence, or to make oneself its accomplice at least, and to
acquiesce-in the critical sense-to the violence of the fact; but in question,
then, is an irreducible zone of factuality, an original, transcendental
violence, previous to every ethical choice, even supposed by ethical
nonviolence. Is it meaningful to speak of a pre
ethical violence? If the transcendental "violence" to which we allude is
tied to phenomenality itself, and to the possibility of language, it then
would be embedded in the root of meaning and logos, before the latter
had to be determined as rhetoric, psychagogy, demagogy, etc.
(c) Levinas writes: "The other, as other, is not only an alter ego. It is
what I myself am not" (EE and TA). "Decency" and "everyday life"
incorrectly lead us to believe that "the other is known through sym
pathy, as an other like myself, as alter ego" (TA). This is exactly what
Husserl does not do. He seeks to recognize the other as other only in its
form as ego, in its form of alterity, which cannot be that of things in
the world. If the other were not recognized as a transcendental alter ego,

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

this is an absolute impossibility. The other as alter ego signifies the other
as other, irreducible to my ego, precisely because it is an ego, because it
has the form of the ego. The egoity of the other permits him to say "ego"
as I do; and this is why he is Other, and not a stone, or a being without
speech in my real economy. This is why, if you will, he is face, can speak to me,
understand me, and eventually command me. Dissymmetry itself would
be impossible without this symmetry, which is not of the world, and
which, having no real aspect, imposes no limit upon alterity and
dissymmetry-makes them possible, on the contrary. This dissymmetry is an
economy in a new sense; a sense which would probably be intolerable to
Levinas.
Despite the logical absurdity of this formulation, this economy is the
transcendental symmetry of two empirical asymmetries. The other, for
me, is an ego which I know to be in relation to me as to an other.
Where have these movements been better described than in The Phenomenology of the Mind? The movement of transcendence toward the other, as
invoked by Levinas, would have no meaning if it did not bear within it, as
one of its essential meanings, that in my ipseity I know myself to be other
for the other. Without this, "I" (in general: egoity), unable to be the other's
other, would never be the victim of violence. The violence of which
Levinas speaks would be a violence without victim. But since, in the
dissymmetry which he describes, the author of violence could never be
the other himself, but always the same (ego), and since all egos are others
for others, the violence without victim would be also a violence without
author. And all these propositions can be reversed without difficulty. It
will be easily understood that if the Parmenides of the Poem gives us to
believe, through interposed historical phantasms, that he lent himself to
parricide several times, the great and fearful white shadow which spoke
to the young Socrates continues to smile

it would be entirely in the world and not, as ego, the origin of the
world. To refuse to see in it an ego in this sense is, within the ethical
order, the very gesture of all violence. If the other was not recognized
as ego, its entire alterity would collapse. Therefore, it seems that one
may not suppose that Husserl makes of the other an other like myself
(in the factual sense of the word), or a real modification of my life,
tions. If the Other was a real moment of my egological life, if "indu
sion of an other monad within my own" (Cartesian Meditations) was real, I'
would perceive it originaliter. Husserl does not cease to emphasize char

157

hen we undertake grand discourses on separate beings, unity, differ
ence, the same and the other. To what exercises would Parmenides give
himself over, at the frontiers of Totality and Infinity, if we attempted to make him
understand that ego equals same, and that the other is what it is only as the
absolute infinitely other absolved of its relationship to the Same. For
example: (1) The infinitely other, he would say perhaps, can
be what it is only if it is other, that is, other than. Other than must be other
than myself. Henceforth, it is no longer absolved of a relation to an ego.

158 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
Therefore, it is no longer infinitely, absolutely other. It is no longer what
it is. If it was absolved, it would not be the other either, but the Same.
(2) The infinitely other cannot be what it is-infinitely otherexcept by
being absolutely not the same. That is, in particular, by being other than
itself (non ego). Being other than itself, it is not what it is. Therefore, it is
not infinitely other, etc.
At bottom, we believe, this exercise is not just verbiage, or dialectical
virtuosity in the "play of the Same." It would mean that the expression
"infinitely other" or "absolutely other" cannot be stated and thought
simultaneously; that the other cannot be absolutely exterior45 to the
same without ceasing to be other; and that, consequently, the same is not
a totality closed in upon itself, an identity playing with itself, having only
the appearance of alterity, in what Levinas calls economy, work, and
history. How could there be a "play of the Same" if alterity itself was not
already in the Same, with a meaning of inclusion doubtless betrayed by the
word in? Without alterity in the same, how could the "play of the Same"
occur, in the sense of playful activity, or of dislocation, in a machine or
organic totality which plays or works? And it could be shown that for Levinas
work, always enclosed inside totality and history, fundamentally remains a
game. A proposition that we can accept, with several precautions, more
easily than he.
Finally, let us confess our total deafness to propositions of this type:
"Being occurs as multiple, and as divided into Same and Other. This is its
ultimate structure" (TI). What is the division of being between the same

and the other? Is it a division between the same and the other, which does not
suppose, at very least, that the same is the other's other, and the other
the same as oneself? We are not only thinking of Parmenides exercise,
playing with the young Socrates. The Stranger in the Sophist
who, like Levinas, seems to break with Eleatism in the name of alterity,
knows that alterity can be thought only as negativity, and above all, can be
said only as negativity, which Levinas begins by refusing; he knows
too, that differing from Being, the other is always relative, is stated pros,,,
eteron, which does not prevent it from being an eidos (or a genre, in a
itself" already supposing, as Heidegger notes in Identity and Difference,'
eksastan auto tauton). Levinas, from his perspective, would refuse to

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

1 59

assimilate the Other to the eteron in question here. But how can the
"Other" be thought or said without reference-we do not say
reduction-to the alterity of the eteron in general? This last notion,
henceforth, no longer has the restricted meaning which permits its
simple opposition to the notion of Other, as if it was confined to the
region of real or logical objectivity. The eteron, here, belongs to a more
profound and original zone than that in which this philosophy of
subjectivity (that is, of objectivity), still implicated in the notion of the
Other, is expanded.
The other, then, would not be what he is (my fellow man as foreigner) if he were not alter ego. This is a self-evidence greatly prior to
"decency" and to the dissimulations of "daily life." Does not Levinas
treat the expression alter ego as if alter were the epithet of a real subject (on a
pre-eidetic level)? As an ephithetical, accidental modification of my real
(empirical) identity? Now, the transcendental syntax of the expression
alter ego tolerates no relationship of substantive to adjective, of absolute to
epithet, in one sense or the other. This is its strangeness. A necessity due to
the finitude of meaning: the other is absolutely other only if he is an ego,
that is, in a certain way, if he is the sarne as I. Inversely, the other as
res is simultaneously less other (not absolutely other) and less "the same"
than I. Simultaneously more and less other, which means, once more, that
the absolute of alterity is the same. And this contradiction (in terms of a
formal logic which Levinas follows for once, since he refuses to call the
other alter ego), this impossibility of translating my relation to the Other
into the rational coherence of language-this contradiction and this
impossibility are not the signs of "irrationality": they are the sign,
rather, that one may no longer draw inspiration from within the
coherence of the Logos, but that thought is stifled in the region of the
origin of language as dialogue and difference. This origin, as the
concrete condition of rationality, is

nothing less than "irrational," but it could not be "included" in
language. This origin is an inscribed inscription.
Further, every reduction of the other to a real moment of my life, its
reduction to the state of empirical alter-ego, is an empirical possibility,
o rather eventuality, which is called violence; and violence presup
poses the necessary eidetic relationships envisaged in Husserl's descriptions.
For, on the contrary, to gain access to the egoity of the alter ego

160 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
as if to its alterity itself is the most peaceful gesture possible. We do not say
absolutely peaceful. We say economical. There is a transcendental and preethical
violence, a (general) dissymmetry whose archia is the same, and which
eventually permits the inverse dissymmetry, that is, the ethical
nonviolence of which Levinas speaks. In effect, either there is only the
same, which can no longer even appear and be said, nor even exercise
violence (pure infinity or finitude); or indeed there is the same and the other,
and then the other cannot be the other-of the sameexcept by being the
same (as itself: ego), and the same cannot be the same (as itself: ego)
except by being the other's other: alter ego. That I am also essentially the
other's other, and that I know I am, is the evidence of a strange
symmetry whose trace appears nowhere in Levinas's descriptions.
Without this evidence, I could not desire (or) respect the other in ethical
dissymmetry. This transcendental violence, which does not spring from an
ethical resolution or freedom, or from
a certain way of encountering or exceeding the other, originally institutes
the relationship between two finite ipseities. In effect, the necessity of
gaining access to the meaning of the other (in its irreducible alterity)
on the basis of its "face," that is, its nonphenomenal phenomenon, its
nonthematic theme, in other words, on the basis of an intentional
modification of my ego (in general), (an intentional modification
upon which Levinas indeed must base the meaning of his discourse);
and the necessity of speaking of the other as other, or to the other as
other, on the basis of its appearing-for-me-as-what-it-is: the other (an

which, however, already signifies alteration of the same, of the other as
what it is) could be determined rigorously on a purely ethical level,
without prior eidetic-transcendental analysis of the relations between
ego and alter-ego in general, betweeen several origins of the world in
general. That the other appears as such only in its relationship to the
same, is a self-evidence that the Greeks had no need to acknowledge in
the transcendental egology which would confirm it later; and, it is
violence as the origin of meaning and of discourse in the reign of
finitude.46 The difference between the same and the other, which is not
a difference or a relation among others, has no meaning in the infinite,
except to speak, as Hegel does and against Levinas, of the anxiety of the
infinite which determines and negates itself Violence, certainly, appears
within the horizon of an idea of the infinite. But this horizon is not the
horizon of the infinitely other, but of a reign in which the difference
between the same and the other, differance, would no longer be valid, that is,
of a reign in which peace itself would no longer have meaning. And first of
all because there would be no more phenomenality or meaning in general.
The infinitely other and the infinitely same, if these words have meaning for a
finite being, is the same. Hegel himself recognized negativity, anxiety or war
in the infinite absolute only as the movement of the absolute's own history,
whose horizon is a final pacification in which alterity would be absolutely
encapsulated, if not lifted up, in parousia.47 How are we to interpret the necessity
of thinking the fact of what is first of all on the horizon in what is generally called
the end of history? Which amounts to asking what the thought of the other as
other means, and whether or not the light of the "as such" is dissimulation in
this unique case. Unique case? No, we must reverse the terms: "other" is the
name, "other" is the meaning of this unthinkable unity of light and

appearing which dissimulates its essential dissimulation, takes it out of
the light, stripping it, and hiding that which is hidden in the other), as
the necessity from which no discourse can escape, from its earliest
origin-these necessities are violence itself, or rather the transcendental
origin of an irreducible violence, supposing, as we said above, that it is

night. What "other" means is phenomenality as disappearance. Is it a
question, here, of a "third route excluded by these contradictory ones"

other, is at the same time nonviolence, since it opens the relation to the

appear, cannot be stated as tertiary. If it is called "trace," the word can
emerge only as a metaphor whose philosophical elucidation will cease
lessly call upon "contradictions." Without which its originality-that

will permit access to the other to be determined, in ethical freedom, as
violence (for example, as the dissimulation or oppression of the other
by the same, a notion which Levinas employs as self-evident, and

which distinguishes it from the Sign (the word conventionally chosen by
phenomenon supposes original contamination by the sign.

162 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
War, therefore, is congenital to phenomenality, is the very emergence
of speech and of appearing. Hegel does not abstain by chance from
pronouncing the word "man" in the Phenomenology of the Mind; and he
describes war (for example, the dialectic of the Master and the Slave)
without anthropological reference, within the realm of a science of
consciousness, that is, of phenomenality itself, in the necessary structure of its
movement: a science of experience and of consciousness.
Discourse, therefore, if it is originally violent, can only do itself violence, can
only negate itself in order to affirm itself, make war upon the war which
institutes it without ever being able to reappropriate this negativity, to the
extent that it is discourse. Necessarily without reappropriating it, for if it did
so, the horizon of peace would disappear into the night (worst violence as
previolence). This secondary war, as the avowal of violence, is the least
possible violence, the only way to repress the worst violence, the violence of
primitive and prelogical silence, of an unimaginable night which would
not even be the opposite of day, an absolute violence which would not
even be the opposite of nonviolence: nothingness or pure non-sense.
Thus discourse chooses itself violently in opposition to nothingness or
pure non-sense, and, in philosophy, against nihilism. For this not to be so,
the eschatology which animates Levinas's discourse would have to have
kept its promise already, even to the extent of no longer being able to
occur within discourse as eschatology, and as the idea of a peace "beyond
history." The "messianic triumph" "armed against evil's revenge" would
have to have been ushered in. This messianic triumph, which is the
horizon of Levinas's book, but which "overflows its framework" (TI),
could abolish violence only by suspending the difference (conjunction or
opposition) between the same and the other, that is, by suspending the idea
of peace. But here and now (in a present in general), this horizon cannot
be stated, an end cannot be stated, eschatology is not possible, except
through violence. This infinite passage through violence is what is
called history. To overlook the irreducibility of this last violence, is to
revert-within the order of philosophical discourse which one cannot
seek to reject, except by risking the worst violence-to an infinitist dogma
tism in pre-Kantian style, one which does not pose the question of
responsibility for its own finite philosophical discourse. It is true that
the delegation of this responsibility to God is not an abdication, God

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

not being a finite third party: thus conceived, divine responsibility
neither excludes nor diminishes the integrity of my own responsibility,
the responsibility of the finite philosopher. On the contrary, divine
responsibility requires and calls for this latter responsibility, as its telos or
its origin. But the fact of the inadequation of these two responsibilities,
or of this unique responsibility for itself-this history or anxiety of the
infinite-is not yet a theme for the pre-Kantian, or rather even pre-Hegelian,
rationalists.
Nor will it be so for as long as the absolutely principial self-evidence, in
Levinas's own terms, of "the impossibility for the ego not to be itself"
is not dissolved. The ego cannot not be itself even when it ventures
out toward the other, nor could it venture forth with this impossibility,
which thus "marks the innate tragedy of the ego, the fact that it is riveted
to its own being" (EE), according to Levinas's strong statement. And above
all, marks the fact that the ego knows this. This knowledge is the first
discourse and first word of eschatology; it is that which permits separation
and speaking to the other. It is not a knowledge among others, but is
knowledge itself. "It is this 'always-beingone-and-yet-always-other'
which is the fundamental characteristic of knowledge, etc." (Schelling).
No philosophy responsible for its language can renounce ipseity in
general, and the philosophy or eschatology of separation may do so less
than any other. Between original tragedy and messianic triumph there
is philosophy, in which violence is returned against violence within
knowledge, in which original finitude appears, and in which the other is
respected within, and by, the same. This finitude makes its appearance
in an irreducibly open question which is the philosophical question in general:
why is the essential, irreducible, absolutely general and unconditioned form of
experience as a venturing forth toward the other still egoity? Why is an
experience which would not be lived as my own (for an ego in general,
in the eidetictranscendental sense of these words) impossible and
unthinkable? This unthinkable and impossible are the limits of reason in
general. In other words: why finitude, if, as Schelling had said, "egoity is the
general principle of finitude"? And why Reason, if it is true that "Reason and
Egoity, in their true Absoluteness, are one and the same" (Schelling), and
true that "reason ... is a kind of universal and essential structure of transcendental subjectivity in general" (Husserl)? The philosophy which is

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

the discourse of this reason as phenomenology cannot answer such a
question by essence, for every answer can be made only in language,
and language is opened by the question. Philosophy (in general) can
only open itself to the question, within it and by it. It can only let itself be
questioned.
Husserl knew this. And he called the irreducibly egoic essence of
experience "archi-factuality" (Urtatsache), nonempirical factuality, transcendental factuality (a notion to which attention has never been paid,
perhaps). "This I am is for me, for the I who says it and understands it
accordingly, the primordial intentional foundation of my world (der intentionale
Urgrund fur meine Welt). 9%48 My world is the opening in which all experience
occurs, including, as the experience par excellence, that which is transcendence toward the Other as such. Nothing can appear outside the
appurtenance to "my world" for "I am." "Whether it is suitable or not,
whether it appears to me monstrous (due to whatever prejudices) or not, I
must stand firm before the primordial fact (die Urtatsache, der ich standhalten muss), from
which I cannot turn my glance for an instant, as a philosopher. For
philosophical children this indeed may be the dark corner to which the
ghosts of solipsism, or of psychologism or relativism, return. The true
philosopher will prefer, instead of fleeing from these ghosts, to illuminate
the dark corner."49 Understood in this sense, the intentional relationship of
"ego to my world" cannot be opened on the
basis of an infinite-other radically foreign to "my world," nor can it be
imposed upon me by a God who determines this relationship: "The
subjective a priori is that which precedes the Being of God and of
everything, without exception, which exists for me, a thinking being.
God too, is for me what he is by my own conscious production; I
cannot look away from this in the anguished fear of what may be
considered blasphemy, but on the contrary must see in it the problem.
Here too, just as concerning the alter ego, 'conscious production' does
not mean that I invent and fashion this supreme transcendence."50 God
no more really depends upon me than does the alter-ego. But he has
meaning only for an ego in general. Which means that before all atheism
or all faith, before all theology, before all language about God or with
God, God's divinity (the infinite alterity of the infinite other, for
example) must have a meaning for an ego in general. Let us note in
passing that the "subjective a priori" recognized by transcendental

1 65

phenomenology is the only possible way to check the totalitarianism of the
neutral, the impersonal "absolute Logic," that is, eschatology without
dialogue and everything classed under the conventional-quite
conventional-rubric of Hegelianism.
The question about egoity as transcendental archi-factuality can be
repeated more profoundly in the direction of the archi-factuality of the
"living present." For egological life has as its irreducible and absolutely
universal form the living present. There is no experience which can be
lived other than in the present. The absolute impossibility of living
other than in the present, this eternal impossibility, defines the
unthinkable as the limit of reason. The notion of a past whose meaning
could not be thought in the form of a (past) present marks the
impossible-unthinkable-unstatable not only for philosophy in general but even for a
thought of being which would seek to take a step outside philosophy.
This notion, however, does become a theme in the meditation of the trace
announced in Levinas's most recent writings. In the living present, the
notion of which is at once the most simple and most difficult of
notions, all temporal alterity can be constituted and appear as such: as
other past present, other future present, other absolute origins relived
in intentional modification, in the unity and actuality of my living present.
Only the actual unity of my living present permits other presents (other
absolute origins) from appearing as such, in what is called memory or
anticipation (for example, but in truth in the constant movement of
temporalization). But only the alterity of past and future presents permits
the absolute identity of the living present as the self-identity of non-self
identity. One would have to shows' on the basis of the Cartesian Meditations,
and given the reduction of every problem of factual genesis, how the question of
anteriority in the relation between the constitution of other as other present
and the constitution of the other as Others is a false question, which must
refer to a common structural root. Although in the Cartesian Meditations
Husserl evokes only the analogy of the two movements (Sec. 52), in many of
the unpublished works he seems to hold them to be inseparable.
In the last analysis, if one wishes to determine violence as the necessity
that the other not appear as what it is, that it not be respected except
in, for, and by the same, that it be dissimulated by the same in the very
freeing of its phenomenon, then time is violence. This

166 WRITING

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

AND DIFFERENCE

movement of freeing absolute alterity in the absolute same is the
movement of temporalization in its most absolutely unconditioned
universal form: the living present. If the living present, the absolute form
of the opening of time to the other in itself, is the absolute form of
egological life, and if egoity is the absolute form of experience, then the
present, the presence of the present, and the present of presence, are all
originally and forever violent. The living present is originally marked by
death. Presence as violence is the meaning of finitude, the meaning of
meaning as history.
But why? Why finitude? Why history?52 And why may we, on what
basis may we, examine this violence as finitude and as history? Why the why?
And from whence does it permit itself to be understood in its
philosophical determination?
Levinas's metaphysics in a sense presupposes-at least we have
attempted to show this-the transcendental phenomenology that it seeks
to put into question. And yet the legitimacy of this putting into question
does not seem to us any less radical. What is the origin of the question
about transcendental archi-factuality as violence? Upon what basis does
one ask questions about finitude as violence? Upon what basis does the
original violence of discourse permit itself to be commanded to be
returned against itself, to be always, as language, the return against itself
which recognizes the other as other? Of course, one cannot answer these
questions (for example, by saying that the question about the violence of
finitude can be posed only on the basis of finitude's other and the idea of
infinity), except by undertaking a new discourse which once more will
seek to justify transcendental
phenomenology. But the naked opening of the question, its silent
opening, escapes phenomenology, as the origin and end of phenom
enology's logos. The silent opening of the question about history as
finitude and violence permits the appearance of history as such; it is the
call (to) (of) an eschatology which dissimulates its own opening,
covers this opening with its own noise as soon as the opening stands

forth and is determined. This is the opening of a question, in the
inversion of transcendental dissymmetry, put to philosophy as logos,'
finitude, history, violence: an interpellation of the Greek by the''
non-Greek at the heart of a silence, an ultralogical affect of speech, a
question which can be stated only by being forgotten in the language

167

of the Greeks; and a question which can be stated, as forgotten, only in the
language of the Greeks. The strange dialogue of speech and silence. The
strange community of the silent question of which we spoke above. It
seems to us that this is the point at which, beyond any misunderstandings
about Husserl's literal ambitions, phenomenology and eschatology can open a
dialogue interminably, be opened in it, calling each
other to silence.

Of ontological violence
Silence is a word which is not a word, and breath an object
which is not an object.
(G. Bataille)

Does not the movement of this dialogue also govern the explication with
Heidegger? It would not be surprising. To be persuaded of this, it would
suffice to notice, in the most schematic way possible, the following: in order
to speak, as we have just spoken, of the present as the absolute form of
experience, one already must understand what time is, must understand the ens of
the praes-ens, and the proximity of the Being of this ens. The present of presence
and the presence of the present suppose the horizon, the precomprehending
anticipation of Being as time. If the meaning of Being always has been
determined by philosophy as presence, then the question of Being, posed on
the basis of the transcendental horizon of time (first stage, in Being and Time) is
the first tremor of philosophical security, as it is of self-confident presence.
Now, Husserl never unfolded this question of Being. If phenomenology carries this question within itself each time that it considers the
themes of temporalization, and of the relationship to the alter ego, it
nonetheless remains dominated by a metaphysics of presence. The
question of Being does not govern its discourse.
Phenomenology in general, as the passageway to essentiality, presupposes an anticipation of the esse of essence, the unity of the esse prior to its
distribution into essence and existence. Via another route, one could
probably show that Husserl silently presupposes a metaphysical
anticipation or decision when, for example, he affirms Being (Sein) as the
nonreality (Realitut) of the ideal (Ideal). Ideality is unreal, but it is-as

object or as thought-being. Without a presupposed access to a meaning of
Being not exhausted by reality, the entire Husserlian theory of ideality
would collapse, and with it all of transcendental phenomenology. For
example, Husserl could no longer write: "Offenbar muss uberhaupt jeder
Versuch, das Sein des Idealen in Fin mogliches Sein von Realem
umzudeuten, daran scheitern, dass Moglichkeiten selbst wieder ideale
Gegenstande sind. So wenig in der realen Welt Zahlen im allgemeinen,
Dreiecke im allgemeinen zu finden rind so wenig Moglichkeiten"
("Manifestly every attempt to reinterpret the Being of the ideal as a
possible Being of the real must fail, on the whole, for the possibilities
themselves are in turn ideal. In the real world, one finds as few
possibilities as one does numbers in general, or triangles in general)." 53
The meaning of Being-before each of its regional determinations-must
be thought first, if one is to distinguish the ideal which is not only from
the real which it is not, but also from the fictional which belongs to the
domain of the possible real. ("Naturally, it is not our intention to place the
Being of the ideal on the same level as the Being-thought of the fictional or the
absurd."" Hundreds of analogous texts could be cited.) But if Husserl can write
this, and if, therefore, he presupposes access to a meaning of Being in
general, how can he distinguish his idealism as a theory of knowledge
from metaphysical idealism? The latter too, posited the unreal Being of the
ideal. Husserl
doubtless would respond, thinking of Plato, that the ideal was realized
within metaphysical idealism, that is, that it was substantified, hypos
tasized, as soon as it was not understood essentially, in each of its
aspects, as noema, and as soon as one imagined that it could be without
in some way being thought or envisaged. This situation would not have
been totally modified later when the eidos became originally and essen
tially noema only in the Understanding or Logos of an infinite subject:
God. But to what extent does transcendental idealism, whose way is
opened thereby, escape the horizon-at the very least-of this infinite
subjectivity? This cannot be debated here.
However, if he had previously opposed Heidegger to Husserl,
Levinas now contests what he calls "Heideggerean ontology": "The
primacy of ontology for Heidegger does not rest on the truism, 'To
know the existent it is necessary to have comprehended the Being of the
existent.' To affirm the priority of Being over the existent is to decide

the essence of philosophy; it is to subordinate the relation with someone, who
is an existent, (the ethical relation) to a relation with the Being of the existent,
which, impersonal, permits the apprehension, the domination of the
existent (a relationship of knowing), subordinates justice to freedom"
(TI, p. 45). This ontology would be valid for every existent, "except for
the other.""
Levinas's phrase overwhelms "ontology": not only would the thought
of the Being of the existent have the impoverished logic of the truism, but
it escapes this poverty only in order to seize and to murder the Other. It is
a laughably self-evident but criminal truism, which places ethics under
the heel of ontology.
Therefore, what of "ontology" and the "truism" ("in order to know the
existent it is necessary to have comprehended the Being of the existent")?
Levinas says that "the primacy of ontology does not rest" on a "truism." Is
this certain? If the truism (true, truth) is fidelity to truth (that is, to the Being
of what is as what it is, and such as it is), it is not certain that thought
(Heidegger, for example) has ever sought to avoid it. "What is strange
about this thought of Being is its simplicity," says Heidegger, at the
very moment, moreover, when he demonstrates that this thought
entertains no theoretical or practical aims. "The accomplishment of this
thought is neither theoretical nor practical; no more does it consist in the
union of these two modes of behavior."56 Is not this gesture of return to
what is within the dissociation of theory and practice also Levinas's
gesture?57 Does he not have to define metaphysical transcendence,
therefore, as a not (yet) practical ethics? We are concerned here with
some rather strange truisms. It is "by the simplicity of its essence" that
"the thought of Being makes itself unknowable for us.""
If, on the contrary, by "truism" one understands, in the realm of
judgment, analytic affirmation and the poverty of tautology, then the
incriminated proposition is perhaps the least analytic of all; for if there were
to be only one thought in the world which escapes the form of the
truism, it would be this one. First, what Levinas envisages in the word
"truism" is not a judicative proposition but a truth previous to judgment,
which in turn founds all possible judgment. A banal truism is the
repetition of the subject in the predicate. Now, Being is not simply a
predicate of the existent, no more than it is the existent's

subject. If it is taken as essence or as existence (as Being-such or Beingthere), if it is taken as copula or as position of existence, or, more
profoundly and more originally, if it is taken as the unitary focal point of
all these possibilities, then the Being of the existent does not belong to the
realm of predication, because it is already implied in all predication in
general, and makes predication possible. And it makes every synthetic or
analytic judgment possible. It is beyond genre and categories,
transcendental in the scholastic sense, before scholasticism had made of
the transcendental a supreme and infinite existent, God himself. It must
be a singular truism that, through which is sought, in the most profound
way, as the most concrete thought of all thoughts, the common root of
essence and existence, without which no judgment, no language would
be possible, and which every concept can only presuppose, by
dissimulating it.59 But if "ontology" is not a truism, or at least a truism
among others, and if the strange difference between Being and the
existent has a meaning, or is meaning, can one speak of the "priority" of
Being in relation to the existent? An important question, here, for it is
this alleged "priority" which, for Levinas, would enslave ethics to
"ontology.
There can be an order of priority only between two determined
things, two existents. Being, since it is nothing outside the existent, a
theme which Levinas had commented upon so well previously, could in
no way precede the existent, whether in time, or in dignity, etc. Nothing is
more clear, as concerns this, in Heidegger's thought. Henceforth, one
cannot legitimately speak of the "subordination" of the existent to Being,
or, for example, of the ethical relation to the ontological relation. To
precomprehend or explicate the implicit relation of Being to the existent60
is not to submit the existent (for example, someone) to Being in a violent
fashion. Being is but the Being-of this existent, and does not exist outside
it as a foreign power, or as a hostile or neutral impersonal element. The
neutrality so often denounced by Levinas can only be the characteristic of
an undetermined existent, of an anonymous optic power, of a conceptual
generality, or of a principle. Now, Being is not a principle, is not a
principial existent, an archia which would permit Levinas to insert the face
of a faceless tyrant under the name of Being. The thought of Being (of
the existent) is radically foreign to the search for a principle, or even
for a root (although

certain images lead us to believe this, occasionally), or for a "tree of
knowledge": it is, as we have seen, beyond theory, and is not the first
word of theory. It is even beyond all hierarchies. If every "philosophy,"
every "metaphysics," has always sought to determine the first existent, the
excellent and truly existent existent, then the thought of the Being of the
existent is not this metaphysics or first philosophy. It is not even ontology
(cf. above), if ontology is another name for first philosophy. Since it is
not first philosophy concerned with the archi-existent, that is, the first
thing or first cause which governs, then the thought of Being is neither
concerned with, nor exercises, any power. For power is a relationship
between existents. "Such thinking has no result. It produces no effect"
(Humanismus). Levinas writes: "Ontology, as first philosophy, is a
philosophy of power" (TI). This is perhaps true. But we have just seen
that the thought of Being is neither ontology, nor first philosophy, nor. a
philosophy of power. Foreign to every first philosophy, it is not opposed
to any kind of first philosophy. Not even to morals, if, as Levinas says,
"morals is not a branch of philosophy but first philosophy" (TI). Foreign to
the search for an ontic archia in general, for an ethical or political archia in
particular, it is not foreign, in the sense understood by Levinas who accuses it
precisely of this foreignness, in the way violence is foreign to
nonviolence, or evil to good. One may say of it what Alain said of
philosophy: it "is no more politics" (or ethics) ... than it is agriculture."
Which does not mean that it is an industry. Radically foreign to ethics,
it is not a counterethics, nor a subordination of ethics to a function in
the realm of ethics that is already secretly violent: the neutral. Levinas
always reconstructs, and not only in the case of Heidegger, the polis or kind
of social organization whose delicate outline he believes can be traced
through a discourse offered neither as sociological, nor as political, nor as
ethical. Thus it is paradoxical to see the Heideggerean city governed by a
neutral power, by an anonymous discourse, that is, by the "one" (man)
whose inauthenticity Heidegger was the first to describe. And if it is true,
in a difficult sense, that the Logos, according to Heidegger, "is the Logos of
no one," this certainly does not mean that it is the anonymity of
oppression, the impersonality of the State, or the neutrality of the "one
says." It is anonymous only as the possibility of the name and of
responsibility. "But if man must one day arrive in the neighborhood of

172

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

Being, he must first learn to exist in that which has no name" (Humanism).
Did not the Kabbala also speak of the unnameable possibility of the Name?
The thought of Being, therefore, can have no human design, secret or not.
Taken by itself, it is doubtless the only thought which no anthropology,
no ethics, and above all, no ethico-anthropological psychoanalysis will
ever enclose."
Quite the contrary. Not only is the thought of Being not ethical
violence, but it seems that no ethics-in Levinas's sense-can be opened
without it. Thought-or at least the precomprehension of Beingconditions (in its own fashion, which excludes every ontic conditionality:
principles, causes, premises, etc.) the recognition of the essence of the existent
(for example someone, existent as other, as other self, etc.). It conditions the
respect for the other as what it is: other. Without this acknowledgment,
which is not a knowledge, or let us say without this "letting-be" of an
existent (Other) as something existing outside me in the essence of what
it is (first in its alterity), no ethics would be possible. "To let be" is an
expression of Heidegger's which does not mean, as Levinas seems to
think,62 to let be as an "object of comprehension first," and, in the case of
the Other, as "interlocutor
afterward." The "letting-be" concerns all possible forms of the exist
ent, and even those which, by essence, cannot be transformed into
"objects of comprehension."63 If it belongs to the essence of the other
first and foremost to be an "interlocutor" and to be "interpellated,"
then the "letting-be" will let the Other be what it is, will respect it as
interpellated-interlocutor. The "letting-be" does not only, or by privil
ege, concern impersonal things. To let the other be in its existence and
essence as other means that what gains access to thought, or (and) what
thought gains access to, is that which is essence and that which is
existence; and that which is the Being which they both presuppose.
Without this, no letting-be would be possible, and first of all, the
letting be of respect and of the ethical commandment addressing itself
to freedom. Violence would reign to such a degree that it would no
longer even be able to appear and be named.
Therefore, the "relation to the Being of the existent" cannot possibly
dominate the "relation to the existent." Heidegger not only would
criticize the notion of a relation to Being, just as Levinas criticizes that of

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

173

a relation to the other, but also the notion of domination: Being is not elevated,
is not the land of the existent, for elevation belongs to the existent.
There are few themes which have demanded Heidegger's insistence to
this extent: Being is not an excellent existent.
That Being is not above the existent does not imply that it is beside it. For
then it would be another existent. Therefore, it is difficult to speak of "the
ontological significance of the existent in the general economy of Being-which
Heidegger simply places beside Being through a distinction ..." (EE) It is
true that Levinas acknowledges elsewhere that "if there is distinction, there
is not separation" (TA); and this is already to acknowledge the impossibility
of every relationship of ontic domination between Being and existent. In
reality, there is not even a distinction in the usual sense of the word, between
Being and existent. For reasons of essence, and first because Being is
nothing outside the existent, and because the opening amounts to the onticoontological difference, it is impossible to avoid the ontic metaphor in order
to articulate Being in language, in order to let Being circulate in
language. This is why Heidegger says of language that it is "lichtendverbergende Ankunft des seins sdbst" (Humanismus). At one and the same time
language illuminates and hides Being itself. Nevertheless, Being itself is alone in
its absolute resistance to every metaphor. Every philology which allegedly reduces
the meaning of Being to the metaphorical origin of the word "Being,"
whatever the historical (scientific) value of its hypotheses, misses the
history of the meaning of Being. This history is to such an extent the history
of a liberation of Being as concerns the determined existent, that one existent among others has come to be thought of as the eponymous existent of
Being, for example, respiration. Renan and Nietzsche, for example, refer to
respiration as the etymological origin of the word Being when they wish to
reduce the meaning of what they take to be a concept-the indeterminate
generality of Being-to its modest metaphorical origin. (Renan: On the Origin
of Language. Nietzsche: The Birth of Philosophy)." Thus is explained all of
empirical history, except precisely for the essential, that is, the thought that
respiration and non-respiration are, for example. And are in a determined
way, among other ontic determinations. Etymological empiricism, the
hidden root of all empiricism, explains everything except that at a given
moment the metaphor, has been thought as metaphor, that is, has been
ripped apart as the veil of Being.

174 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

This moment is the emergence of the thought of Being itself, the very
movement of metaphoricity. For this emergence still, and always, occurs
beneath an other metaphor. As Hegel says somewhere, empiricism always
forgets, at very least, that it employs the words to be. Empiricism is
thinking by metaphor without thinking the metaphor as such.
Concerning "Being" and "respiration," let us permit ourselves a
juxtaposition which does not only have the value of a historical curiosity. In
a letter to X . . ., dated March 1638, Descartes explains that the proposition
" 'I breathe, therefore I am' concludes nothing, if it has not been proven
previously that one exists, or if one does not imply: I think that I breathe
(even if I am mistaken in this), therefore I am; and it is nothing other to state
in this sense I breathe, therefore I am than I think, therefore I am." Which means, in
terms of what concerns us here, that the meaning of respiration is always
but a dependent and particular determination of my thought and my
existence, and a fortiori of thought and of Being in general. Supposing
that the word "Being" is

derived from a word meaning "respiration" (or any other determined
thing), no etymology or philology-as such, and as determined
sciences-will be able to account for the thought for which "respiration"
(or any other determined thing) becomes a determination of Being
among others. Here, for example, no philology will be able to account
for the gesture of Descartes's thought. One must travel
other roads-or an other reading of Nietzsche-in order to trace the
genealogy of the unheard-of meaning of Being.
This is a first reason why the "relation with an existent," with some
one (the ethical relation), cannot be "dominated" by "a relation with
Second reason: the "relation with the Being of the existent," which
is in no way a relation, above all is not a "relation of knowledge."65 It is

is because it is not science that Heidegger sometimes refuses it even the
name of ontology, after having distinguished it from metaphysics, and

apprehended per genus et differentiam specificam" (EDE). Now, according to
Levinas, all violence is a violence of the concept; and both Is Ontology
Fundamental? and Totality and Infinity interpret the thought of Being as a
concept of Being. Opposing himself to Heidegger, Levinas writes, among
many other similar passages: "In our relation with the Other, the latter
does not affect us on the basis of a concept" (Is Ontology
Fundamental?). According to Levinas, it is finally the absolutely
undetermined concept of Being which offers the Other to our understanding, that is, to our power and our violence. Now Heidegger is
emphatic on this point: the Being which is in question is not the concept to which
the existent (for example, someone) is to be submitted (subsumed). Being
is not the concept of a rather indeterminate and abstract predicate, seeking
to cover the totality of existents in its extreme universality: (1) because it is
not a predicate, and authorizes all predication; (2) because it is "older" than the
concrete presence of the ens; (3) because belonging to Being does not cancel
any predicative difference, but, on the contrary, permits the emergence of
every possible difference.66 Being is therefore transcategorical, and
Heidegger would say of it what Levinas says of the other: it is "refractory to
the category" (TI). "The question of Being as a question of the possibility
of the concept of Being arises from the preconceptual comprehension of
Being, 1161 writes Heidegger, opening a dialogue and a repetition, (as
concerns the Hegelian concept of pure Being as nothingness), which will
not cease to deepen and, in the style which is almost always that of
Heidegger's dialogue with the thinkers of tradition, will not cease to permit
Hegel's discourse to grow and to speak-Hegel's discourse as that of all
of

metaphysics (Hegel included, or rather, being entirely included in
Hegel).
Thus, the thought or pre-comprehension of Being signifies nothing
less than a conceptual or totalitarian com-prehension. What we have
just said of Being could also be said of the same .6B To treat Being

1 7 6 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
determination, in effect, presupposes the thought of Being. Without it, how
can one give meaning to Being as other, as other self, to the
irreducibility of the existence and the essence of the other, and to the
consequent responsibility? etc. "This prerogative ... of being answerable to oneself
as essent, in short, this prerogative of existing, involves in itself the necessity of a
comprehension of Being."69 If to understand Being is to be able to let be
(that is, to respect Being in essence and existence, and to be responsible
for one's respect), then the understanding of Being always concerns
alterity, and par excellence the alterity of the Other in all its originality:
one can have to let be only that which one is not. If Being is always to be
let be, and if to think is to let Being be, then Being is indeed the other of
thought. But since it is what it is only by the letting-be of thought, and
since the latter is thought only by virtue of the presence of the Being
which it lets be, then thought and Being, thought and the other, are the
same; which, let us recall, does not mean identical, or one, or equal.
This amounts to stating that the thinking of Being does not make of
the other a species of the genre Being. Not only because the other

is "refractory to the category," but because Being is not a category.
Like the Other, Being is not at all the accomplice of the totality,
whether of the finite totality, (the violent totality of which Levinas
speaks) or of an infinite totality. The notion of totality is always related
to the existent. It is always a "metaphysical" or "theological" notion,
and the notions of finite and infinite take on meaning in
relation to it.70 Foreign to the finite totality, or to the infinity of
existents, foreign in the sense specified above, foreign without being
another existent or another totality of existents, Being could not
oppress or enclose the existent and its differences. If the glance of the
command, then I must be able to let be the other in his freedom 4

VIOLENCE AND METAPH YSIcS

violences of the an-archy whose possibility, in history, is still the
accomplice of archism.
Just as he implicitly had to appeal to phenomenological self
evidences against phenomenology, Levinas must ceaselessly suppose
and practice the thought of precomprehension of Being in his dis
course, even when he directs it against "ontology." Otherwise, what
would "exteriority as the essence of Being" mean (TI)? And that
"eschatology places one in relation to Being, beyond the totality or history,
and not with Being beyond past and present" (TI)? And "to support
pluralism as the structure of Being" (DL)? And that "the encounter
with the face is, absolutely, a relation to what is. Perhaps man alone is
substance, and this is why he is face"?" Ethico-metaphysical transcendence therefore presupposes ontological transcendence. The
epekeina tes ousias (in Levinas's interpretation) would not lead beyond Being
itself, but beyond the totality of the existent or the existent-hood of the
existent (the Being existent of the existent), or beyond ontic history.
Heidegger also refers to the epekeina tes ousias in order to announce ontological
transcendence,72 but he also shows that the undetermined agathon toward
which transcendence breaks through has
been determined too quickly.
Thus, the thought of Being could not possibly occur as ethical violence. On the contrary, without it one would be forbidden to let be the
existent, and one would enclose transcendence within identification and
empirical economy. By refusing, in Totality and infinity, to accord any dignity
to the ontico-ontological difference, by seeing in it only a ruse of war, and
by calling the intra-ontic movement of ethical transcendence (the
movement respectful of one existent toward another) metaphysics, Levinas
confirms Heidegger in his discourse: for does not the latter see in
metaphysics (in metaphysical ontology) the forgetting of

Being and the dissimulation of the ontico-ontological difference?

As Being is not the lord of the existent, its priority (ontic metaphor)
It thinks Being in an implicit fashion, as is inevitable in every language. This

into question, which makes the search for an archia tremble. Only th
thought of Being can do so, and not traditional "philosophy 'o

metaphysics, and must first occur as the metaphysics of metaphysics in the
question "What is Metaphysics?" But the difference between the
implicit and the explicit is the entirety of thought; and if correctly
determined, it imprints its form on all ruptures and on the most radical

178 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
questions. "It is true," says Heidegger once more, "that Metaphysics
represents the existent in its Being, and thus thinks the Being of the
existent. But it does not think the difference of Being and the
existent." 14
For Heidegger, it is therefore metaphysics (or metaphysical on
tology) which remains a closure of the totality, and transcends the
existent only toward the (superior) existent, or toward the (finite or
infinite) totality of the existent. This metaphysics essentially would be
tied to a humanism which never asks itself "in what manner the
essence of man belongs to the truth of Being ."75 "What is proper to all
metaphysics is revealed in its 'humanism 11116 Now, Levinas simul
taneously proposes to us a humanism and a metaphysics. It is a ques
tion of attaining, via the royal road of ethics, the supreme existent, the
truly existent ("substance" and "in itself" are Levinas's expressions) as
other. And this existent is man, determined as face in his essence as man
on the basis of his resemblance to God. Is this not what Heidegger has in
mind when he speaks of the unity of metaphysics, humanism and
onto-theology? "The encounter with the face is not only an
anthropological fact. It is, absolutely speaking, a relation with what is.
Perhaps man alone is substance, and this is why he is face." Certainly. But
it is the analogy between the face and God's visage that, in the most
classical fashion, distinguishes man from animal, and determines man's
substantiality: "The Other resembles God." Man's substantiality, which
permits him to be face, is thus founded in his resemblance to God, who
is therefore both The Face and absolute substantiality. The theme of the
Face thus calls for a second reference to Descartes. Levinas never formulates
it: it is, as recognized by the Schoolmen, the ambiguity of the notion of
substance as concerns God and his creatures (cff for example, Principes, I,
sec. 51). By means of more than one mediation we thus are referred to the
Scholastic problem of the analogy. We do not intend to enter into it here."
Let us simply notice that conceived on the

basis of a doctrine of analogy, of "resemblance," the expression
"human face" is no longer, at bottom, as foreign to metaphor as
Levinas seems to wish. ". . . The Other resembles God...." Is this not the
original metaphor? The question of Being is nothing less than a
disputation of the metaphysical truth of this schema; which, let us note in
passing, "atheistic humanism" employs precisely in order to denounce

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

179

the very process of alienation. The question of Being draws back into this
schema, this opposition of humanisms, in the direction of the thought
of Being presupposed by the determination of the existentman, the
existent-God, and the analogical relationship between them; for the
possibility of this relationship can be opened solely by the preconceptual
and pre-analogical unity of Being. It is a question neither of substituting
Being for God, nor of founding God on Being. The Being of the existent
(for example, God)" is not the absolute existent, nor the infinite existent,
nor even the foundation of the existent in general. This is why the
question of Being cannot budge the metaphysical edifice of Totality and
Infinity (for example). It is simply forever out of reach for the "inversion of
the terms" ontology and metaphysics that Levinas proposes. The theme of this
inversion, therefore, does not play an indispensable role, have meaning
and necessity, except in the economy and coherence of Levinas's book in its
entirety.
What would it mean, for metaphysics and for humanism, to ask "in
what manner the essence of man belongs to the truth of Being"
(Humanismus)? Perhaps this: would the experience of the face be possible,
could it be stated, if the thought of Being were not already implied in
it? In effect, the face is the inaugural unity of a naked glance and of a right
to speech. But eyes and mouth make a face only if, beyond need, they
can "let be," if they see and they say what is such as it is, if they reach the
Being of what is. But since Being is, it cannot simply be produced, but
precisely must be respected by a glance and a speech; Being must
provoke them, interpellate them. There is no speech without the
thought and statement of Being. But as Being is nothing outside the
determined existent, it would not appear as such without the possibility
of speech. Being itself can only be thought and stated. It is the
contemporary of the Logos, which itself can only be as the Logos of Being,
saying Being. Without this double genitivity, speech, cut off from Being and
enclosed in the determined existent, would be only (according to
Levinas's terminology) the cry of need before desire, the gesture of the
self in the realm of the homogenous. It is only then, in the reduction or
subordination of thought to Being, that "philosophical discourse itself"
would not be "only a failed act, the pretext for an uninterrupted
psychoanalysis or philology or sociology in which the appearance of
discourse vanishes into the All" (TI). It is

180 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

only then that the relation to exteriority would no longer catch its
breath. The metaphysics of the face therefore encloses the thought of
Being, presupposing the difference between Being and the existent at
the same time as it stifles it.
If this difference is original, if to think Being outside the existent is
to think nothing, or if it is to think nothing no more than it is to approach
the existent other than in its Being, doubtless one has some right to say
with Levinas (excepting the ambiguous expression "Being in general")
that "the relation to the expressed existent preexists ... the unveiling of
Being in general ... ; at the ontological plane, the ethical one" (TI; my
italics). If preexistence has the ontic sense which it must have, then this
is incontestable. In fact, in existence the relationship with the expressed
existent precedes the unveiling, the explicit thinking, of Being itself
With the limitation that there is no expression, in the sense of speech and
not of need, except if there is already, implicitly, thought of Being.
Likewise, in fact, the natural attitude precedes the transcendental reduc
tion. But we know that ontological or transcendental "priority" is not
of this order, and no one has ever alleged that it was. This "priority" no
more contradicts than it confirms ontic or factual precedence. It fol
lows that Being, since it is always, in fact, determined as an existent and
is nothing outside the existent, is always dissimulated. Levinas's
phrase-the preexistence of the relation to the existent-is the very

formula of this initial concealment. Being not existing before the
Existent-and this is why it is History-it begins by hiding itself beneath its
determination. This determination as the revelation of the existent
(Metaphysics) is the very veiling of Being. There is nothing accidental or
regrettable about this. "The unconcealing of the existent, the clarity

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

permits the reemergence of the notion of "eschatology," as it appears, for
example, in Holzwege: "Being itself ... is in itself eschatological" (p. 302).
The relationship between this eschatology and messianic eschatology
requires closer examination. The first supposes that war is not an accident
which overcomes Being, but rather Being itself. "Das Sent selber das
Strittige ist" (Brief uber den Humanismus, p.189). A proposition which must
not be understood in consonance with Hegelianism: here, negativity
has its origin neither in negation, nor in the anxiety of an infinite and
primary existent. War, perhaps, is no longer even conceivable as negativity.
Heidegger, as is well known, calls the original dissimulation of Being
beneath the existent, which is prior to the error in judgment, and
which nothing precedes in the ontic order, erring [Irren: erring, going
astray]: "Every epoch of world history is an epoch of erring"
(Holzwege p. 311). If Being is time and history, then erring and the
epochal essence of Being are irreducible. Henceforth, how can one accuse
this thought of interminable wandering of being a new paganism of the
Site, a complacent cult of the Sendentary? (TI, DL).79 Here, the solicitation of
the Site and the Land is in no way, it must be emphasized, a passionate
attachment to territory or locality, is in no way a provincialism or
particularism. It is, at very least, as little linked to empirical
"nationalism" as is, or should be, the Hebraic nostalgia for the Land, a
nostalgia provoked not by an empirical passion, but by the irruption of a
speech or a promise." Is not to interpret the Heideggerean theme of the
Land or the Dwelling as a nationalism or a Barresism first of all to express
an allergy-the word, the accusation, which Levinas plays upon so often-to
the "climate" of Heidegger's philosophy? Levinas acknowledges,
moreover, that his "reflections," after having submitted to inspiration by "the
philosophy of Martin Heidegger, I'll are governed by a profound need to
depart from the climate of this philosophy"

accorded to it, darkens the light of Being. Being draws back in that it is
of the thinking of Being as of a thought dominated by the theme of
unveiling (TI)? Without this dissimulation of Being by the existent,
there would be nothing, and there would be no history. That Being'
occurs in all respects as history and as world means that it can only,

(EE). In question here is a need whose natural legitimacy we would be

historical "epochs" are metaphysical (ontotheological) determinations

physical concepts. In the strange light of this being-history Heidegget

Heidegger, as for the Jew and the Poet. The proximity of the Site is

the last to question; what is more, we believe that its climate is never
totally exterior to thought itself. But does not the naked truth of the other
appear beyond "need," "climate," and a certain "history"? And

182

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

always held in reserve, says Holderlin as commented on by Heidegger.81 The
thinking of Being thus is not a pagan cult of the Site, because the Site is
never a given proximity but a promised one. And then also because it is
not a pagan cult. The Sacred of which it speaks belongs neither to religion
in general, nor to a particular theology, and thus cannot be determined by
any history of religion. It is first the essential experience of divinity or
of deity. As the latter is neither a concept nor a reality, it must provide
access to itself in a proximity foreign to mystical theory or affectivity,
foreign to theology and to enthusiasm. Again, in a sense which is
neither chronological nor logical, nor ontical in general, it precedes every
relationship to God or to the Gods. This last relationship, of whatever type,
in order to be lived and stated supposes some precomprehension of the
Deity, of God's Being-god, of the "dimension of the divine" of which
Levinas also speaks by saying that it "is opened on the basis of the human
face" (TI). This is all, and as usual it is simple and difficult. The sacred is the
"only essential space of divinity which in turn opens only a dimension
for the gods and the god . . ."(Humanis-mus). This space (in which Heidegger
also names Elevation)82 is within faith and atheism. Both presuppose it.
"It is only on the basis of the truth of Being that the essence of the
Sacred can be thought. It is only on the basis of the
essence of the Sacred that the essence of Divinity must be thought. It is
only in the light of the essence of Divinity that one can think and say
what the word 'God' must designate" (Humanismus). This precompre
hension of the Divine cannot not be presupposed by Levinas's dis
course at the very moment when he seeks to oppose God to the Sacred
divine. That the gods or God cannot be indicated except in the Space of
the Sacred and in the light of the deity, is at once the limit and the
wellspring of finite-Being as history. Limit, because divinity is not God. In
a sense it is nothing. "The sacred, it is true, appears. But the god
remains distant."83 Wellspring, because this anticipation as a thought
of Being (of the existent God) always sees God coming, opens the possi
bility (the eventuality) of an encounter with God and of a dialogue

That the Deity of God, which permits the thinking and naming of
God, is nothing, and above all is not God himself, is what Meister
Eckhart, in particular, said this way: "God and the deity are as different

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

183

from one another as heaven and earth.... God operates, deity does not
operate, has nothing to operate, has no operation in it, has never any
operation in view" (Sermon Nolite timere cos). But this deity is still
determined as the essence-of-the-threefold-God. And when Meister
Eckhart seeks to go beyond these determinations, the movement which he
sketches seems to remain enclosed in ontic transcendence. "When I said that
God was not a Being and was above Being, I did not thereby contest his
Being, but on the contrary attributed to him a more elevated Being" (Quasi stella
matutina...). This negative theology is still a theology and, in its literality at least,
it is concerned with liberating and acknowledging the ineffable transcendence
of an infinite existent, "Being above Being and superessential negation." In
its literality at least, but the difference between metaphysical ontotheology,
on the one hand, and the thought of Being (of difference), on the other,
signifies the essential importance of the letter. Since everything occurs in
movements of increasing explicitness, the literal difference is almost the
entire difference of thought. This is why, here, when the thought of Being
goes beyond optic determinations it is not a negative theology, nor even a
negative ontology.
"Ontological" anticipation, transcendence toward Being, permits, then,
an understanding of the word God, for example, even if this
understanding is but the ether in which dissonance can resonate. This
transcendence inhabits and founds language, and along with it the
possibility of all Being-together; the possibility of a Mitsein much more
original than any of the eventual forms with which it has often been
confused: solidarity, the team, companionship." Implied by the discourse
of Totality and infinity, alone permitting to let be others in their truth, freeing
dialogue and the face to face, the thought of Being is thus as dose as
possible to nonviolence.
We do not say pure nonviolence. Like pure violence, pure nonviolence is a
contradictory concept. Contradictory beyond what Levinas calls "formal
logic." Pure violence, a relationship between beings without face, is not
yet violence, is pure nonviolence. And inversely: pure nonviolence, the
nonrelation of the same to the other (in the sense understood by
Levinas) is pure violence. Only a face can arrest violence, but can do so, in
the first place, only because a face can provoke it. Levinas says it well:
"Violence can only aim at the face" ("La violence ne pent

184 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

viser qu'un visage" TI). Further, without the thought of Being which
opens the face, there would be only pure violence or pure nonviolence.
Therefore, the thought of Being, in its unveiling, is never foreign to a
certain violence." That this thought always appears in difference, and
that the same-thought (and) (of) Being-is never the identical, means
first that Being is history, that Being dissimulates itself in its occurrence,
and originally does violence to itself in order to be stated and in order to
appear. A Being without violence would be a Being which would
occur outside the existent: nothing; nonhistory; nonoccurrence;
nonphenomenality. A speech produced without the least violence would
determine nothing, would say nothing, would offer nothing to the other;
it would not be history, and it would show nothing: in every sense of the
word, and first of all the Greek sense, it would be speech without phrase.
In the last analysis, according to Levinas, nonviolent language would be a
language which would do without the verb to be, that is, without
predication. Predication is the first violence. Since the verb to be and the
predicative act are implied in every other verb, and in every common
noun, nonviolent language, in the last analysis, would be a language of pure
invocation, pure adoration, proffering only proper nouns in order to call to
the other from afar. In effect, such a language would be purified of all
rhetoric, which is what Levinas explicitly desires; and purified of the first
sense of rhetoric, which we can invoke without artifice, that is, purified
of every verb. Would such a language still deserve its name? Is a
language free from all rhetoric possible? The Greeks, who taught us what
Logos meant, would never have accepted this. Plato tells us in the Cratylus
(425a), the Sophist (262 ad) and in Letter VII (342b), that there is no
Logos which does not suppose the interlacing of nouns and verbs.
Finally, if one remains within Levinas's intentions, what would a
language without phrase, a language which would say nothing, offer to the
other? Language must give the world to the other, Totality and Infinity tells us. A
master who forbids himself the phrase would give nothing. He would have no
disciples but only slaves. The work-or liturgy-that is
the expenditure which breaks with economy, and which must not be
thought, according to Levinas, as a Game, would be forbidden to him.'

Thus, in its most elevated nonviolent urgency, denouncing the

VIOLENCE AND METAPHYSICS

185

passage through Being and the moment of the concept, Levinas's
thought would not only propose an ethics without law, as we said
above, but also a language without phrase. Which would be entirely
coherent if the face was only glance, but it is also speech; and in speech it is
the phrase which makes the cry of need become the expression of desire.
Now, there is no phrase which is indeterminate, that is, which does not
pass through the violence of the concept. Violence appears with
articulation. And the latter is opened only by (the at first preconceptual)
circulation of Being. The very elocution of nonviolent metaphysics is its
first disavowal. Levinas doubtless would not deny that every historical
language carries within it an irreducible conceptual moment, and therefore
a certain violence. From his point of view, the origin and possibility of the
concept are simply not the thought of Being, but the gift of the world to
the other as totally-other (cf, for example, TI, p.175). In its original
possibility as offer, in its still silent intention, language is nonviolent (but
can it be language, in this pure intention?). It becomes violent only in its
history, in what we have called the phrase, which obliges it to articulate
itself in a conceptual syntax opening the circulation of the same, permitting
itself to be governed both by "ontology" and by what remains, for Levinas,
the concept of concepts: Being. Now, for Levinas, the concept of Being
would be only an abstract means produced for the gift of the world to the other
who is above Being. Hence, only in its silent origin, before Being, would
language be nonviolent. But why history? Why does the phrase impose
itself? Because if one does not uproot the silent origin from itself
violently, if one decides not to speak, then the worst violence will
silently cohabit the idea of peace? Peace is made only in a certain silence, which
is determined and protected by the violence of speech. Since speech says
nothing other than the horizon of this silent peace by which it has itself
summoned and that it is its mission to protect and to prepare, speech
indefinitely remains silent. One never escapes the economy of war.
It is evident that to separate the original possibility of speech-as nonviolence and gift-from the violence necessary in historical actuality is to
prop up thought by means of transhistoricity. Which Levinas does
explicitly, despite his initial critique of Husserlian "anhistoricism." For
Levinas, the origin of meaning is nonhistory, is "beyond history." One
would then have to ask whether it is any longer possible

to identify thought and language as Levinas seeks to do; and one would
have to ask whether this transhistoricity of meaning is authentically
Hebraic in its inspiration; and finally, whether this nonhistory uproots
itself from history in general, or only from a certain empirical or ontic
dimension of history. And whether the eschatology invoked can be
separated from every reference to history. For our own reference to history, here, is only
contextual. The economy of which we are speaking does not any longer accommodate the
concept of history such as it has always functioned, and which it is difficult, if not impossible, to lift
from its teleological or eschatological horizon.
The ahistoricity of meaning at its origin is what profoundly separates
Levinas from Heidegger, therefore. Since Being is history for the latter, it
is not outside difference, and thus, it originally occurs as (nonethical)
violence, as dissimulation of itself in its own unveiling. That language,
thereby, always hides its own origin is not a contradiction, but history
itself. In the ontological-historicalB7 violence which permits the thinking of
ethical violence, in economy as the thought of Being, Being is
necessarily dissimulated. The first violence is this dissimulation, but it is
also the first defeat of nihilistic violence, and the first epiphany of Being.
Being, thus, is less the primum cognitum, as was said, than the first
dissimulated, and these two propositions are not contradictory. For Levinas,
on the contrary, Being (understood as concept) is the first dissimulating, and
the ontico-ontological difference thereby would neutralize difference, the
infinite alterity of the totally-other. The ontico-ontological difference,
moreover, would be conceivable only on the basis of the idea of the
Infinite, of the unanticipatable irruption of the totally-other existent. For
Levinas, as for Heidegger, language would be at once a coming forth
and a holding back [reserve], enlightenment and obscurity; and for
both, dissimulation would be a conceptual gesture. But for Levinas, the
concept is on the plane of Being; for Heidegger it is on the plane of ontic
determination.
This schema accentuates their opposition but, as is often the case, also
permits one to conjecture about their proximity: the proximity of two
"eschatologies" which by opposed routes repeat and put into question
the entire "philosophical" adventure issued from Platonism. Interrogate
it simultaneously from within and without, in the form of a question
to Hegel, in whom this adventure is thought and recapitulated. This
proximity would be indicated in questions of this type: on the

one hand, is God (the infinite-other-existent) still an existent which can be
precomprehended on the basis of a thought of Being (singularly, of
divinity)? In other words, can infinity be called an ontic determination?
Has not God always been thought of as the name of that which is not a
supreme existent precomprehended on the basis of a thought of Being? Is
not God the name of that which cannot be anticipated on the basis of the
dimension of the divine? Is not God the other name of Being (name
because nonconcept), the thinking of which would open difference and
the ontological horizon, instead of being indicated in them only?
Opening of the horizon, and not in the horizon. Through the thought of
infinity, the ontic enclosure would have already been broken-but in a
sense of the unthought that would have to be examined more closely-by
means of what Heidegger calls metaphysics and onto-theology. On the other
hand: is not the thought of Being the thought of the other before being the
homogeneous identity of the concept, and the asphixiation of the same? Is
not the beyond-history of eschatology the other name of the transition to a
more profound history, to History itself? But to a history which, unable any
longer to be itself in any original or final presence, would have to change its
name?
In other words, perhaps one might say that ontology precedes theology only by putting between brackets the content of the optic
determination which, in post-Hellenic philosophical thought, is called
God: to wit, the positive infinity. The positive infinity would only have the
(nominal) appearance of what is called an ontic determination. In truth,
it would be that which refuses to be an ontic determination which is
included as such in the thought of Being, that is, on the basis and in the
light of a thought of Being. On the contrary, it is infinity-as
nondetermination and concrete operation-which would permit the
thinking of the difference between Being and ontic determination. The
ontic content of infinity would destroy ontic closure. Implicitly or not,
the thought of infinity would open the question, and the ontico
ontological difference. Paradoxically, it would be this thought of infin
ity (what is called the thought of God) which would permit one to
affirm the priority of ontology over theology, and to affirm that the
thought of Being is presupposed by the thought of God. Doubtless, it is
for this reason that Duns Scotus or Malebranche, respectful of the pres
ence in all thought of uniform Being, or Being in general, did not believe

188 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
it necessary to distinguish between the levels of ontology (or metaphysics) and theology. Heidegger often reminds us of the "strange
simplicity" of the thought of Being: this is both its difficulty and that
which properly touches upon the "unknowable." For Heidegger, infinity
would be only one eventual determination of this simplicity. For
Malebranche, infinity is its very form: "The idea of the extended infinite
thus encloses more reality than that of the heavens; and the idea of the
infinite in all genres of Being, that which corresponds to this word, Being,
the infinitely perfect being, contains infinitely more [reality), although the
perception with which this idea affects us is the slightest of all; and is
slighter to the extent that it is more vast, and consequently infinitely slight
because infinite" (Entretien d'un philosophe chretien avec on philosophe
chinois.) Since Being is nothing (determined), it is necessarily produced i n
difference (as difference). Is, on the one hand, to say that Being is
infinite, or to say, on the other, that it is revealed as produced only "in
simultaneity with" (in Bins mit) Nothingness (What Is Metaphysics?)-which
means that it is "finite in its essence" (ibid.)
fundamentally to say anything else? But one would have to show that
Heidegger never meant "anything else" than classical metaphysics, and
that the transgression of metaphysics is not a new metaphysical or
onto-theological thesis. Thus, the question about the Being of the
existent would not only introduce-among others the question about
question, and as the answer within its question. God always would be
implied in every question about God, and would precede every

cause is presupposed. See therefore, Oratour, how easie Theologicall
difficulty is.... If that which in every question is presupposed, be in
divine matters an answer unto the question, then of God there can be no
proper question, because the answer coincides with it."

By making the origin of language, meaning, and difference the relation to
the infinitely other, Levinas is resigned to betraying his own intentions
in his philosophical discourse. The latter is understood, and
instructs, only by first permitting the same and Being to circulate
within it. A classical schema here complicated by a metaphysics of
dialogue and instruction, of a demonstration which contradicts what is
demonstrated by the very rigor and truth of its development. The
thousand-times-denounced circle of historicism, psychologism, relativism, etc. But the true name of this inclination of thought to the

recognized beneath the naivete of certain of its historical expressions. It

difference. Empiricism is its philosophical name, its metaphysical
dybreak, as soon as language awakens. But perhaps one will object that
is language which is sleeping. Doubtless, but then one must, in a

certain way, become classical once more, and again find other grounds for
the divorce between speech and thought. This route is quite, perhaps
too, abandoned today. Among others, by Levinas.
By radicalizing the theme of the infinite exteriority of the other,
Levinas thereby assumes the aim which has more or less secretly animated all the philosophical gestures which have been called empiricisms in
the history of philosophy. He does so with an audacity, a profundity, and a
resoluteness never before attained. By taking this project to its end, he
totally renews empiricism, and inverses it by revealing it to itself as
metaphysics. Despite the Husserlian and Heideggerean stages of his thought,
Levinas does not even seek to draw back from the word empiricism. On two
occasions, at least, he speaks for "the radical empiricism confident in the
instruction of exteriority" (TI). The experience of the other (of the
infinite) is irreducible, and is therefore "the experience par excellence"
(TI). And, concerning death which is indeed its irreducible resource,
Levinas speaks of an "empiricism which is in no way a positivism."" But
can one speak of an experience of the other or of difference? Has not the
concept of experience always been determined by the metaphysics of
presence? Is not experience always an encountering of an irreducible
presence, the perception of a phenomenality?
This complicity between empiricism and metaphysics is in no way
surprising. By criticizing them, or rather by limiting them with one and
the same gesture, Kant and Husserl indeed had recognized their
solidarity. It calls for closer meditation. Schelling went quite far in this
direction."
But empiricism always has been determined by philosophy, from
Plato to Husserl, as nonphilosophy: as the philosophical pretention to nonphilosophy, the inability to justify oneself, to come to one's own aid as
speech. But this incapacitation, when resolutely assumed, contests the
resolution and coherence of the logos (philosophy) at its root, instead of
letting itself be questioned by the logos. Therefore, nothing can so
profoundly solicit the Greek logos-philosophy-than this irruption of the
totally-other; and nothing can to such an extent reawaken the logos to its
origin as to its mortality, its other.
But if one calls this experience of the infinitely other Judaism (which
is only a hypothesis for us), one must reflect upon the necessity in which
this experience finds itself, the injunction by which it is

ordered to occur as logos, and to reawaken the Greek in the autistic
syntax of his own dream. The necessity to avoid the worst violence, which
threatens when one silently delivers oneself into the hands of the other in
the night. The necessity to borrow the ways of the unique philosophical
logos, which can only invert the "curvature of space" for the benefit of the
same. A same which is not the identical, and which does not enclose the
other. It was a Greek who said, "If one has to philosophize, one has to
philosophize; if one does not have to philosophize, one still has to
philosophize (to say it and think it). One always has to philosophize."
Levinas knows this better than others: "One could not possibly reject the
Scriptures without knowing how to read them, nor say philology without
philosophy, nor, if need be, arrest philosophical discourse without
philosophizing" (DL). "One must refer-I am convinced-to the medium of all
comprehension and of all understanding in which all truth is reflectedprecisely to Greek civilization, and to what it produced: to the logos, to
the coherent discourse of reason, to life in a reasonable State. This is
the true grounds of all understanding" (DL). Such a site of encounter
cannot only offer occasional hospitality to a thought which would remain
foreign to it. And still less may the Greek absent himself, having loaned his
house and his language, while the Jew and the Christian meet in his
home (for this is the encounter in question in the text just cited).
Greece is not a neutral, provisional territory, beyond borders. The history in
which the Greek logos is produced cannot be a happy accident providing
grounds for understanding to those who understand eschatological
prophecy, and to those who do not understand it at all. It cannot be outside
and accidental for any thought. The Greek miracle is not this or that, such and
such astonishing success; it is the impossibil
ity for any thought ever to treat its sages as "sages of the outside,"
according to the expression of Saint John Chrysostom. In having
proffered the epekeina tes ousias, in having recognized from its second
word (for example, in the Sophist) that alterity had to circulate at the
origin of meaning, in welcoming alterity in general into the heart of
the logos, the Greek thought of Being forever has protected itself
against every absolutely surprising convocation.
Are we Jews? Are we Greeks? We live in the difference between the
Jew and the Greek, which is perhaps the unity of what is called history.

We live in and of difference, that is, in hypocrisy, about which Levinas so
profoundly says that it is "not only a base contingent defect of man, but the
underlying rending of a world attached to both the philosophers and the
prophets" (TI, p. 24).
Are we Greeks? Are we Jews? But who, we? Are we (not a chronological, but a pre-logical question) first Jews or first Greeks? And does the
strange dialogue between the Jew and the Greek, peace itself, have the
form of the absolute, speculative logic of Hegel, the living logic which
reconciles formal tautology and empirical heterology' after having thought
prophetic discourse in the preface to the Phenomenology of the Mind? Or, on
the contrary, does this peace have the form of infinite separation and of
the unthinkable, unsayable transcendence of the other? To what horizon
of peace does the language which asks this question belong? From
whence does it draw the energy of its question? Can it account for the
historical coupling of Judaism and Hellenisrn? And what is the legitimacy,
what is the meaning of the copula in this proposition from perhaps the
most Hegelian of modern novelists: "Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes

"GENESIS AND STRUCTURE"
AND PHENOMENOLOGY
I must begin with a precaution and a confession. When, in order to approach a
philosophy, one is armed not only with a pair of concepts-here,
"structure and genesis"-that has been determined or overburdened
with reminiscences by a long problematical tradition, but also with a
speculative grid in which the classical figure of an antagonism is
apparent from the start, then the operative debate which one prepares to
undertake from within this philosophy, or on the basis of it, is in
danger of appearing to be not so much an attentive scrutiny as a
putting into question, that is, an abusive investiga don which
introduces beforehand what it seeks to find, and does

violence to the physiology proper to a body of thought. No doubt, to
at a philosophy by introducing the foreign substance of a debate
be efficacious, may surrender or set free the meaning of a latent

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

to enclose his expectations or his concern in an option, a decision, a
solution; and this would be the result of a speculative or "dialectical"
attitude, in the sense that Husserl, at least, always sought to ascribe to this
word. Not only are the metaphysicians guilty of this attitude, but often,
unbeknownst to themselves, so are the adherents of the empirical
sciences: both groups would be congenitally guilty of a certain sin of
explicationism. The phenomenologist, on the contrary, is the "true
positivist" who returns to the things themselves, and who is selfeffacing before the originality and primordiality of meanings. The process
of a faithful comprehension or description, and the continuity of
explication must dispel the shadow of a choice. Thus one might say, and
in an entirely prejudicial fashion, that Husserl, by his rejection of system
and speculative closure, and by virtue of the style of his thought, is
attuned to the historicity of meaning and to the possibility of its
becoming, and is also already respectful of that which remains open
within structure. And even when one comes to think that the opening of
the structure is "structural," that is, essential, one already has progressed to
an order heterogeneous to the first one: the difference between the (necessarily
closed) minor structure and the structurality of an opening-such,
perhaps, is the unlocatable site in which philosophy takes root.
Particularly when it speaks of and describes structures. Thus, the
presumption of a conflict between the genetic approach and the
structural approach from the outset appears to be superimposed upon the
specificity of what is given to a virgin glance. And if the question
"structure or genesis" had been exposed to Husserl ex abrupto, I wager that
he would have been quite astonished to see himself called into such a
debate; he would have answered that it depends upon what one intends
to speak about. There are some givens
which must be described in terms of structure, and others which must
be described in terms of genesis. There are layers of meaning which
appear as systems, or complexes, or static configurations, within

creation and movement, that is, in the modes of primordial origin, of
becoming, or of tradition; and these require that in speaking of them

1 95

one use the language of genesis, supposing that there is one, or that there
is only one.
The image of this fidelity to the theme of the description can be
found in Husserl's (at least apparent) fidelity to himself all along his
itinerary. To show this, I will take two examples.
1. The transition from the genetic researches in the only book
whose method, or some of whose psychologistic presuppositions,
Husserl renounced (I am thinking of Philosophie der Arithmetik), to the Logische
Untersuchungen in particular (where above all it was a question of describing the
objectivity of ideal objectivities in a certain atemporal fixedness, and in
their autonomy as concerns a certain subjective becoming). This
transition has an explicative continuity, and Husserl is so sure of this that
more than forty years later he writes: "This fixing of attention on the
formal, and a first understanding of its meaning, I acquired through my
Philosophie der Arithmetik (1891), which, despite its immaturity as a first text,
nonetheless represented a first attempt to attain clarity as to the true
meaning, the authentic and original meaning, of the concepts of set
theory and number theory, and did so by returning to the spontaneous
activities of colligation and numeration in which collections ('totalities',
'sets') and numbers are given in an originally productive way. Therefore it
was, to use my later way of expressing myself, a research deriving from
constitutive phenomenology ..." etc.'
It will be objected that fidelity is easily explained here, since it is a
question of grasping, in the dimension of the "transcendental gen

esis," an intention that was first attached perhaps more "naively" but
with sure uncertainty to a psychological genesis.
2. But one cannot say the same about the transition-within phenomenology this time-from the structural analyses of static constitution
practiced in Ideen I (1913) to the analyses of genetic constitution which
follow, and which are sometimes quite new in their content. And yet
this transition is still a simple progress which implies no "surpassing"
(as it is called) and still less an option, and especially not a repentance. It is
the deepening of a work which leaves intact what has been uncovered, a
work of excavation in which the baring of both the genetic foundations
and the original productivity not only neither
shakes nor ruins the superficial structures already unearthed, but also

196 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

brings eidetic forms once again to light, that is the "structural a
prioris"-this is Husserl's expression-of genesis itself.
Thus, in Husserl's mind at least, there was never a "structuregenesis" problem but only a privilege of one or the other of these two
operative concepts, according to the space of description, the quid or the
quomodo of the givens. In this phenomenology, where, at first glance, and if
one takes inspiration from traditional schemas, motifs of conflict or of
tension appear numerous (it is a philosophy of essences always
considered in their objectivity, their intangibility, their apriority; but, by
the same token, it is a philosophy of experience, of becoming, of the
temporal flux of what is lived, which is the ultimate reference; it is also a
philosophy in which the notion of "transcendental experience" designates
the very field of reflection, in a project which, in Kant's eyes for example,
would have derived from teratology), one finds no clashes; and the
mastery of the phenomenologist at work would have assured Husserl of
a perfect serenity in the usage of these two always complementary
operative concepts. Phenomenology, in the clarity of its intention, would
be offended, then, by our preliminary question.
Having taken these precautions as concerns Husserl's aims, I must now
confess my own. In effect, I would like to attempt to show:
First, that beneath the serene use of these concepts is to be found a
debate that regulates and gives its rhythm to the progression of the
description, that gives to the description its "animation," and whose
incompleteness, which leaves every major stage of phenomonology
unbalanced, makes new reductions and explications indefinitely
necessary.
Second, that this debate, at every instant endangering the very principles of the method, appears-I say "appears," for this is a hypothesis
which even if it is not confirmed might permit us, at least, to accentuate
the original characteristics of the Husserlian attempt-appears thus to
force Husserl to transgress the purely descriptive space and
transcendental pretention of his research, and to move toward a metaphysics of history in which the solid structure of a Telos would permit him
to reappropriate, by making it essential and by in some way pre

scribing its horizon, an untamed genesis which grew to greater and
greater expanse, and seemed to accommodate itself less and less to
phenomenological apriorism and to transcendental idealism.

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

197

I will follow alternately the thread of a debate interior to Husserl's
thought, and the thread of a combat on the flank of Husserl's field of
research into which he had to enter on two occasions; I refer to the two
polemics which placed him in opposition to those philosophies of
structure called Diltheyism and Gestaltism.
Husserl, thus, ceaselessly attempts to reconcile the structuralist demand (which
leads to the comprehensive description of a totality, of a form or a
function organized according to an internal legality in which elements
have meaning only in the solidarity of their correlation or their
opposition), with the genetic demand (that is the search for the origin
and foundation of the structure). One could show, perhaps, that the
phenomenological project itself is born of an initial failure of this
attempt.
In Philosophic der Arithmetik, the objectivity of a structure, that of numbers
and arithmetical series-and, correlatively, that of the arithmetical
attitude-is tied to the concrete genesis which must make it possible.
From the start, Husserl refuses, and will always refuse, to accept the
intelligibility and normativity of this universal structure as manna
fallen from a "heavenly place" (topos ouranios),z or as an eternal truth
created by an infinite reason. To seek out the subjective origin of
arithmetical objects and values, here, is to turn back toward perception,
toward perceptual ensembles, and toward the pluralities and totalities
found in perception in a premathematical organization. By virtue of its
style this return to perception and to acts of colligation or numeration
yields to the then frequent temptation vaguely named "psychologism."3
But Husserl indicates his reservations on more than one score and he
never reaches the point of construing an actual genetic constitution as an
epistemological validation, as Lipps, Wundt, and several others had the
tendency to do (although it is true that read attentively, and for themselves,
they would appear more prudent and less simplistic than one would be
tempted to believe on the basis of Husserl's criticisms of them).
Husserl's originality is to be recognized in that: (a) he distinguishes
number from concept, that is, from a constructum, a psychological
artifact; (b) he underlines that mathematical or logical synthesis is
irreducible to the order-in both senses of the word of psychological

198

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

temporality; (c) he bases his entire psychological analysis on the already given
possibility of an objective etwas uberhaupt, which Frege will criticize under the
denomination bloodless specter (blutloses Gespenst) but which designates the
intentionalÂ° dimension of objectivity, the transcendental relation to the
object that no psychological genesis can institute but can only presuppose
in its own possibility. Consequently, the respect for arithmetical meaning,
for its ideality and its normativity, forbids Husserl any psychological deduction
of the number at the very moment when both his stated method and the
tendencies of the period should have pushed him toward one, It remains
that the intentionality presupposed by the movement of genesis is still
conceived by Husserl as a trait, as a psychological structure of consciousness,
like character and the state of something factual. Now, the meaning of the
number can do very well without the intentionality of a factual
consciousness. This meaning, that is, this ideal objectivity and
normativity is precisely independence from any factual consciousness; and
Husserl quickly will be obliged to acknowledge the legitimacy of Frege's
criticisms: the essence of the number derives from psychology to the same
extent as does the existence of the North Sea. Moreover, neither unity nor
zero can be engendered on the basis of a multiplicity of positive acts, facts,
or psychic events. What is true for arithmetical unity is also true for the
unity of every object in general.
If Husserl gives up the psychological routes when confronted by all the
difficulties of accounting for a structure of ideal meaning on the basis of
a factual genesis, he no less rejects the logicizing conclusion with which
his critics wished to corner him. Whether in the then current Platonic
or Kantian style, this logicism was preoccupied above all with the autonomy
of logical ideality as concerns all consciousness in general, or all concrete
and non-formal consciousness. Husserl, for his part, seeks to maintain
simultaneously the normative autonomy of logical or mathematical ideality
as concerns all factual consciousness, and its original dependence in
relation to a subjectivity in general; in general, but concretely. Thus he had to
navigate between the Scylla and Charybdis of logicizing structuralism and
psychologistic genetism (even in the subtle and pernicious form of the
"transcendental psychologism" attributed to Kant). He had to open up a
new direction of philosophical attention and permit the discovery of a
concrete, but

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

199

nonempirical, intentionality, a "transcendental experience" which would
be "constitutive," that is, like all intentionality, simultaneously
productive and revelatory, active and passive. The original unity, the
common root of activity and passivity is from quite early on the very
possibility of meaning for Husserl. And this common root will ceaselessly be experienced as the common root of structure and genesis
which is dogmatically presupposed by all the ulterior problematics and
dissociations concerning them. Husserl will attempt to prepare an
access to this common radicality through the diverse "reductions,"
which are presented initially as neutralizations of psychological genesis
and even of every factual genesis in general. The first phase of
phenomenology, in its style and its objects, is structuralist, because first
and foremost it seeks to stay clear of psychologism and historicism. But
it is not genetic description in general which is disqualified, but only the
genetic description which borrows its schemas from naturalism and
causalism, and depends upon a science of "facts" and therefore on an
empiricism; and therefore, concludes Husserl, depends upon a relativism
incapable of insuring its own truth; therefore, on a skepticism. The
transition to the phenomenological attitude is made necessary, thus, by
the impotence or philosophical fragility of genetism when the latter, by
means of a positivism which does not understand itself, believes itself
capable of enclosure by a "science-offacts" (Tatsachenwissenschaft),
whether this be a natural science or a science of the mind. The expression
"worldly genesis" covers the domain of these sciences.
For as long as the phenomenological space has not been uncovered, and
for as long as the transcendental description has not been undertaken,
the problem of "structure and genesis" seems to have no meaning. Neither
the idea of structure, which isolates the different spheres of objective
signification with respect for their static originality, nor the idea of
genesis, which effects abusive transitions from one region to another,
appears adequate to clarify the problem which is already Husserl's, that is,
the problem of the foundation of objectivity.
This might appear to be inconsequential: can one not imagine, in
effect, a methodological fecundity of these two notions in the various
domains of the natural and social sciences to the extent that the latter, in
their own movement and moment, in their actual labor, do not have

to answer for the meaning and value of their objectivity? Not at all.
Even the most naive utilization of the notion of genesis, and especially of
the notion of structure, supposes at very least that the natural regions and
the domains of objectivity have been rigorously circumscribed. Now,
this prior circumscription, this elucidation of the meaning of each
regional structure can derive only from a phenomenological critique. The
latter is always rightfully primary, because it alone can answer, before every
empirical inquiry and in order for such an inquiry to be possible,
questions of this kind: what is the physical thing, what is the
psychological thing, what is the historical thing, etc. etc. ?-questions
whose answer was more or less dogmatically implied by the structural or
genetic techniques.
Let us not forget that if Philosophic der Arithmetik is the contemporary of the
most ambitious, systematic, and optimistic of psychogenetic attempts,
Husserl's first phenomenological works were developed approximately at
the same time as the first structuralist projects, or at least those which
stated structure as a theme, for it would not be difficult to show that a
certain structuralism has always been philosophy's most spontaneous
gesture. Now, Husserl states his objections to Diltheyism and Gestaltism,
those first philosophies of structure, in a way that is identical in principle
to his objections to genetism.
In Husserl's eyes the structuralism of the Weltanschauungsphilosophie is a
historicism. And despite Dilthey's vehement protests, Husserl will persist
in thinking that, like all historicism, and despite its originality, the
Weltanschauungsphilosophie avoids neither relativism nor skepticism.' For it
reduces the norm to a historical factuality, and it ends by confusing, to
speak the language of Leibniz and of the Logische Untersuchungen (vol.
I, p.188), the truths of fact and the truths of reason. Pure truth or the
pretension to pure truth is missed in its meaning as soon as one attempts,
as Dilthey does, to account for it from within a determined historical
totality, that is, from within a factual totality, a finite totality all of
whose manifestations and cultural productions are structurally solidary
and coherent, and are all regulated by the same function, by the same
finite unity of a total subjectivity. This meaning of truth, or of the
pretension to truth, is the requirement of an absolute, infinite omnitemporality and universality, without limits of any kind. The idea of
truth, that is the Idea of philosophy

or of science, is an infinite Idea, an idea in the Kantian sense. Every
totality, every finite structure is inadequate to it. Now the idea or the
project which animates and unifies every determined historical structure,
every Weltanschauung, is finite:' on the basis of the structural description of a
vision of the world one can account for everything except the infinite opening to
truth, that is, philosophy. Moreover, it is always something like an
opening which will frustrate the structuralist project. What I can never
understand, in a structure, is that by means of which it is not closed.
If Husserl attacked Diltheyismewith such violence, it is that he found in
Diltheyism a seductive attempt, a tempting aberration. Dilthey, in effect,
has the merit of protesting against the positivist naturalization of the life of
the mind. The act of "understanding" that he opposes to explication
and objectification must be the first and major route to be followed by
the sciences of the mind. Husserl thus pays homage to Dilthey, and
shows himself quite hospitable: first, to the idea of a principle of
"understanding" or of re-understanding, of "reliving" (Nachleben)notions simultaneously to be juxtaposed with the notion of Einfiihlung,
borrowed from Lipps and transformed by Husserl, and with the notion of
Reaktivierung, which is the active reliving of the past intention of an
other mind and the reawakening of a production of meaning-in question
here is the very possibility of a science of the mind; second, to the idea
that there exist totalitarian structures endowed with a unity of internal
meaning, spiritual organisms in a sense, cultural worlds all of whose
functions and manifestations are solidary and to which Weltanschauungen
correspond correlatively; third, to the distinction between physical
structures, in which the principle of relationship is external causality,
and mental structures, in which the principle of relationship is what
Husserl will call "motivation."
But this renewal is not fundamental, and it only intensifies the historicist menace. History does not cease to be an empirical science of
"facts" because it has reformed its methods and techniques, or because it
has substituted a comprehensive structuralism for causalism, atomism,
and naturalism, or because it has become more attentive to cultural
totalities. Its pretension to founding normativity on a better understood
factuality does not become more legitimate, but only

202

increases its powers of philosophical seduction. A confusion of value and
existence, and more generally, of all types of realities and all types of
idealities is sheltered beneath the equivocal category of the historical.'
Thus, the theory of the Weltanschauung must revert back or be reduced
to the strict limits of its own domain; its contours are sketched by a certain
difference between wisdom and knowledge; and by an ethical indictment and
impatience. This irreducible difference is due to an interminable
delaying [differance] of the theoretical foundation. The exigencies of life
demand that a practical response be organized on the field of historical
existence, and that this response precede an absolute science whose
conclusions it cannot await. The system of this anticipation, the structure
of this interrupted response is what Husserl calls Weltanschauung. One
might say, with some precautions, that he sees in it the situation and meaning
of a "provisional morality,"10 whether it be personal or communal.
Up to now, we have been interested in the "structure-genesis"
problem which first presented itself to Husserl outside the borders of
phenomenology. It is the radicalization of the presuppositions of
psychology and history that made the transition to the phenomenological
attitude necessary. Let us now attempt to catch up with the same problem in
the field of phenomenology, keeping in mind Husserl's methodological
premises, notably the "reduction" in its eidetic and transcendental
forms. Truthfully, we will see that it cannot be a question of the same
problem, but only of an analogous or "parallel" problem, as Husserl
would say; and the meaning of this notion of "parallelism," which we
will touch upon shortly, presents problems that are not among the least
difficult.
If the first phase of the phenomenological description and the "constitutive analyses" (a phase of which Ideas is the most elaborated trace) is
resolutely static and structural in its design, it seems to be so for at least
two reasons. (A) Reacting against the historicist or psychologistic genetism
with which he continues to be at loggerheads, Husserl systematically
excludes every genetic preoccupation." The protests made against this
attitude perhaps have contaminated and indirectly have determined
Husserl's own attitude: everything occurs as if at this point he considered
every genesis as associative, causal, factual and worldly. (B) Concerned above
all else with formal ontology and with objectivity

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

203

in general, Husserl applies himself especially to the articulation between
the object in general (whatever its regional appurtenance) and
consciousness in general (Ur-Region). He defines the forms of selfevidence in general, and thereby seeks to attain the ultimate critical and
phenomenological jurisdiction, under which the most ambitious
genetic description later will be subsumed.
Thus, if Husserl distinguishes between empirical and eidetic structure
on the one hand, and between empirical and eidetictranscendental
structure on the other, at this time he has not yet taken the same step as
concerns genesis.
Within the pure transcendentality of consciousness, at this phase of the
description, our problem would take on at least-since we must
choose-two forms. And in both cases, it is a question of closure or of
opening.
1. Differing from mathematical essences, the essences of pure consciousness are not, and in principle cannot be, exact. The difference
between exactitude and rigor recognized by Husserl is well known. An eidetic
descriptive science, such as phenomenology, may be rigorous, but it is
necessarily inexact-I would rather say "anexact" due to no failure on
its part. Exactitude is always a product derived from an operation of
"idealization" and of "transition to the limit" which can only concern an
abstract moment, an abstract eidetic element (spatiality, for example) of a
thing materially determined as an objective body, setting aside,
precisely, the other eidetic elements of a body in general. This is why
geometry is a "material" and "abstract" science." It follows that a
"geometry of experience," a "mathematics of phenomena" is
impossible: this is an "attempt doomed to miscarry."" This means in
particular, for what concerns us here, that the essences of consciousness, and therefore the essences of "phenomena" in general, cannot
belong to a structure or "multiplicity" of the mathematical type. Now
what is it that characterizes such a multiplicity for Husserl, and at this
time? In a word, the possibility of closure." Here, we cannot enter into the
intramathematical difficulties always raised by this Husserlian conception
of mathematical "definitude," especially when confronted by certain later
developments of axiomatics and by Godel's discoveries. What Husserl
seeks to underline by means of this comparison between an exact and a
morphological science, and what we must retain here, is

204

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

the principled, essential, and structural impossibility of closing a structural
phenomenology. It is the infinite opening of what is experienced, which is
designated at several moments of Husserlian analysis by reference to an Idea
in the Kantian sense, that is, the irruption of the infinite into consciousness, which
permits the unification of the temporal flux of consciousness just as it
unifies the object and the world by anticipation,
and despite an irreducible incompleteness. It is the strange presence of
this Idea which also permits every transition to the limit and the pro
duction of all exactitude.
2. Transcendental intentionality is described in Ideas I as an original
structure, an archi-structure (Ur-Struktur) with four poles and two correlations: the noetico-noematic correlation or structure and the morphehyle
correlation or structure. That this complex structure is the structure both of
intentionality, that is, the structure of the origin of meanings and of the
opening to the light of phenomenality, and that the occlusion of this
structure is non-sense itself, is indicated by at least two signs: (A) Noesis
and noema, the intentional moments of the structure, can be distinguished
in that the noema does not belong to consciousness in a real way. Within
consciousness, in general there is an agency which does not really belong to it.
This is the difficult but decisive theme
of the non-real (reell) inclusion of the noema.75 Noema, which is the
objectivity of the object, the meaning and the "as such" of the thing
for consciousness, is neither the determined thing itself in its untamed
existence (whose appearing the noema precisely is), nor is it a properly
subjective moment, a "really" subjective moment, since it is indubit
ably given as an object for consciousness. It is neither of the world nor
of consciousness, but it is the world or something of the world for
consciousness. Doubtless it can rightfully be laid bare only on the basis
of intentional consciousness, but it does not borrow from intentional
consciousness what metaphorically we might call, by avoiding the real
of consciousness, its "material." This real nonappurtenance to

any region at all, even to the archi-region, this anarchy of the noema is the
root and very possibility of objectivity and of meaning. This irregionality of
the noema, the opening to the "as such" of Being and to the
determination of the totality of regions in general, cannot be
described, stricto sensu and simply, on the basis of a determined regional
structure. This is why the transcendental reduction (to the extent that it

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

205

must remain an eidetic reduction if one is to know what one will
continue to speak about, and if one is to avoid empirical or absolute
idealism) may appear deceitful, since it does provide access to a determined
region, whatever its founding privilege. One might think that once the
nonreality of the noema was acknowledged, a conversion of the entire
phenomenological method would have followed, as well as an
abandonment of transcendental idealism along with the Reduction. But
would this not have been, then, to condemn oneself to silencewhich is
always possible, moreover-and in any event to renounce a rigor that only
the eidetic-transcendental limitation and a certain regionalism can ensure? In
any event, the transcendentality of the opening is simultaneously the origin
and the undoing, the condition of possibility and a certain impossibility of
every structure and of every systematic structuralism. (B) While the
noema is an intentional and non-real element, the hyle is a real but not
intentional element of the experienced. It is the sensate (experienced and
not real) material of affect before any animation by intentional form. It is
the pole of pure passivity, of the nonintentionality without which
consciousness could not receive anything other than itself, nor exercise its
intentional activity. This receptiveness is also an essential opening. If, on the
level at which Ideas remains, Husserl renounces the description and
interrogation of the hyle for itself and in its pure ingenuity, if he renounces
the examination of the possibilities entitled formless materials and immaterial forms,
16
if he keeps to the constituted hyle-morphic correlation, it is that his analyses
are still developed (and will they not always be so, in a certain way?) from
within a constituted temporality." Now, at its greatest depth and in its pure
specificity the hyle is primarily temporal matter. It is the possibility of
genesis itself Thus at these two poles of opening and from within the very
transcendental structure of all consciousness there would arise the necessity
for the transition to a genetic constitution and for the new "transcendental
aesthetic" which will be announced unceasingly but will be deferred
always, and within which the themes of the other and of Time were to
have permitted their irreducible complicity to appear. It is that the
constitution of the other and of time refers phenomenology to a zone in
which its "principle of principles" (as we see it, its metaphysical principle: the
original self-evidence and presence of the thing itself in person) is radically put into
question.

206

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

In any event, as can be seen, the necessity of this transition from the
structural to the genetic is nothing less than the necessity of a break or
a conversion.
Before following this movement interior to phenomenology and the
transition to the genetic analyses, let us pause for a moment at a second
border problem.
All the problematical schemas which we have just indicated belong to
the transcendental sphere. But might not a psychology renewed by the
double influence of phenomenology and Gestalt psychology, 18 one which
maintains its distance from associationism, atomism, causalism, etc., alone
pretend to assume such a description and such problematical schemas?
In a word, can a structuralist psychology, one allegedly independent from
transcendental phenomenology if not from phenomenological
psychology, make itself invulnerable to the reproach of psychologism
formerly directed against classical psychology? It was all the more
tempting to think so in that Husserl himself prescribed the
establishment of a phenomenological psychology, an "apriorical"
psychology, to be sure, but also a worldly one (in that it cannot exclude the
position of the worldly thing that the psyche is), and strictly parallel to
transcendental phenomenology. Now the overcoming of the invisible
difference which separates parallel things is not innocent: it is the most
subtle and ambitious gesture of psychologistic abuse. And this is the
principle of the critiques which Husserl addresses to the psychologies

mentioned explicitly." To avoid "naturalism" it does not suffice to
escape atomism. And in order to clarify the distance which must separate
a phenomenological psychology from a transcendental phenomen
ology, one would have to examine the nothing which prevents them
from coming together, the parallelism which liberates the space ofa
transcendental question. This nothing is what permits the transcendental
toward this nothing in which the totality of meaning and the meaning of
totality permit their origin to appear. That is, according to Finks
expression, the origin of the world.
If we had the time and the means, we would now have to approach the
developed after Ideas. I will simply note the following points.

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

207

The profound unity of this genetic description is diffracted, without
being dispersed, along three lines. (A) The logical route. The task of Erfahrung and
Urteil, Formaler and Transzendentaler Logik, and numerous analogous texts is to
undo, to "reduce" not only the superstructures of scientific
idealizations and the values of objective exactitude, but also all
predicative sedimentation belonging to the cultural layer of subjectiverelative truths in the Lebenswelt. This in order to regrasp and "reactivate"
the emergence of theoretical or practical predication in general, and on
the basis of the most untamed precultural life. (B) The egological route. In
a sense this route is already latent beneath the preceding one. First, because
in the most general fashion, phenomenology cannot and may not ever
describe anything but the intentional modifications of the eidos ego in
general." Next, because the genealogy of logic kept to the realm of cogitata
and the acts of the ego as if to its proper existence and life; and these
were read only on the basis of noematic signs and results, Now
however, as stated in the Cartesian Meditations, it is a question of returning
once more to the couple cogitocogitatum, if you will, in order to
reapprehend the genesis of the ego itself, the ego existing for itself and
"continuously constituting [itself] as existing."" Aside from the delicate
problems of passivity and activity, this genetic description of the ego will
encounter limits which we would be tempted to call definitive, but
which Husserl, of course, considers provisional. They derive from the
fact, he says, that phenomenology is only at its beginnings." In effect
the genetic description of the ego at every instant prescribes the
formidable task of a universal genetic phenomenology. This is announced
in the third route. (C) The historico-teleological route: "...a teleological reason
[runs]

throughout all historicity"23 and particularly "the unity of the history
of the ego."" This third route, which is to provide access to the
eidos of historicity in general (that is, to its telos, for the eidos of a
historicity, and thus of the movement of meaning-which is a
necessarily rational movement-can be only a norm, a value more
essence) cannot be a route among others. The eidetics of history
cannot be an eidetics among others: it embraces the totality of beings. In
effect the irruption of the logos, the accession to human consciousness of
the idea of an infinite task of reason, does not occur only
through a series of revolutions which at the same time would be

2 08

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

self-conversions, seeming to tear open a previous finitude in order to lay
bare the power of a hidden infinity and to give voice to the dynamis of a
silence. These ruptures, which at the same time are unveilings, (and also
coverings up, for the origin dissimulates itself immediately beneath the
new domain of uncovered or produced objectivity) are always already
indicated, Husserl recognizes, "in confusion and in the dark," that is, not only
in the most elementary forms of life and human history, but closer
and closer in animality and nature in general. How can such an
affirmation, made necessary by and in phenomenology itself, be totally
certain within phenomenology? For it does not only concern phenomena
that are experienced and self-evident. Does its inability to be indicated
rigorously anywhere else than in a phenomenology prevent it from alreadyor still-being a metaphysical assertion, the affirmation of a metaphysics
which articulates
itself in a phenomenological discourse? I am satisfied only to raise
these questions here.
Reason, thus, unveils itself. Reason, Husserl says, is the logos which is
produced in history. It traverses Being with itself in sight, in sight of
appearing to itself, that is, to state itself and hear itself as logos. It is speech as
auto-affection: hearing oneself speak.25lt emerges from itself in order to
take hold of itself within itself, in the "living present" of its self-presence.
In emerging from itself, hearing oneself speak constitutes itself as the
history of reason through the detour of writing. Thus it differs from itself in order
to reappropriate itself. The Origin of Geometry describes the necessity of this
exposition of reason in a worldly inscription. An exposition
indispensable to the constitution of truth and the ideality of objects, but
which is also the danger to meaning from what is outside the sign. In the
moment of writing, the sign can always "empty" itself, take flight from
awakening, from "reactivation," and may remain forever closed and
mute. As for Cournot, writing here is the "critical

epoch."
Here, one must become quite attentive to the fact that this lansonant phrases of Hegel's seemed to be for Husserl, correctly o
ncorrectly. For this logos which calls to itself and summons itself by
itself as telos, and whose dynamis tends toward its energeia or entelechiathis
logos does not occur in history and does not traverse Being as a

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

209

foreign empiricity into which both its metaphysical transcendence and
the actuality of its infinite essence would descend and condescend. Logos
is nothing outside history and Being, since it is discourse, infinite discursiveness
and not an actual infinity, and since it is meaning. Now, the irreality of
meaning was discovered by phenomenology as one of its very own
premises. Inversely, no history as self-tradition and no Being could have
meaning without the logos which is the meaning which projects and
proffers itself. Despite all these classical notions, phenomenology does not
abdicate itself for the benefit of a classical metaphysical speculation which
on the contrary, according to Husserl, would have to recognize in
phenomenology the clarified energy of its own intentions. Which
amounts to saying that in criticizing classical metaphysics,
phenomenology accomplishes the most profound project of metaphysics.
Husserl acknowledges or rather claims this himself, particularly in the
Cartesian Meditations. The results of phenomenology are "metaphysical, if it
be true that ultimate cognitions of being should be called metaphysical.
On the other hand, what we have here is anything but metaphysics, in the

customary sense with which metaphysics, as 'first philosophy,' was
instituted originally."26 "Phenomenology indeed excludes every naive
metaphysics... but does not exclude metaphysics as such."" For within the most
universal eidos of mental historicity, the conversion of philosophy into
phenomenology would be the final degree of differentiation (stage, that
is, Stufe, structural level or genetic stage)." The two previous degrees
would be, first, that of a pretheoretical culture, and next, that of the
theoretical or philosophical project (the GrecoEuropean moment)."
The presence of Telos or Vorhaben-the infinite theoretical anticipation which
simultaneously is given as an infinite practical task-for phenomenological consciousness is indicated every time that Husserl speaks
of the Idea in the Kantian sense. The latter is offered within phenomenological selfevidence as evidence of an essential overflowing of actual and adequate
self-evidence. One would have to examine quite closely the intervention
of the Idea in the Kantian sense at various points along Husserl's
itinerary. Perhaps it would appear then that this
Idea is the Idea or very project of phenomenology, that which makes it
possible by overflowing its system of self-evidences or factual

210

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

determinations, or by overflowing this system as phenomenology's
source or end.
Since Telos is totally open, is opening itself, to say that it is the most
powerful structural a priori of historicity is not to designate it as a static and
determined value which would inform and enclose the genesis of Being
and meaning. It is the concrete possibility, the very birth of history
and the meaning of becoming in general. Therefore it is structurally
genesis itself, as origin and as becoming.
All these formulations have been possible thanks to the initial distinction between different irreducible types of genesis and structure:
worldly genesis and transcendental genesis, empirical structure, eidetic
structure, and transcendental structure. To ask oneself the following
historico-semantic question: "What does the notion of genesis in general,
on whose basis the Husserlian diffraction could come forth and be
understood, mean, and what has it always meant? What does the
notion of structure in general, on whose basis Husserl operates and operates
distinctions between empirical, eidetic, and transcendental dimensions
mean, and what has it always meant throughout its displacements? And
what is the historico-semantic relationship between genesis and structure
in general?" is not only simply to ask a prior linguistic question. It is to ask the
question about the unity of the historical ground on whose basis a
transcendental reduction is possible and is motivated by itself. It is to ask
the question about the unity of the world from which transcendental
freedom releases itself, in order to make the origin of this unity appear.
If Husserl has not asked these questions in terms of his

torical philology, if he did not first ask himself about the meaning of his
operative instruments in general, it is not due to naivete, dogmatic
precipitation, or a neglect of the historical weight of language. It is
rather because to ask oneself about the meaning of the notions of
structure or genesis in general, before the dissociations introduced by,
reduction, is to interrogate that which precedes the transcendental
reduction. Now the latter is but the free act of the question, which frees,
itself from from the totality of what precedes it in order to be able to
access to this totality, particularly to its historicity and its past. Th
question of the possibility of the transcendental reduction cannot expect
an answer. It is the question of the possibility of the question, opening itself,
the gap on whose basis the transcendental I, which Hussei4

GENESIS AND STRUCTURE

211

was tempted to call "eternal" (which in his thought, in any event,
means neither infinite nor ahistorical, quite the contrary) is called upon
to ask itself about everything, and particularly about the possibility of the
unformed and naked factuality of the nonmeaning, in the
case at hand, for example, of its own death.

When I write there is nothing other than what I write. Whatever

... whatever way you turn you have not even started thinking.
(Artaud, Collected Works I, p. 89)
Naivete of the discourse we begin here, speaking toward Antonin
Artaud. To diminish this naivete we would have had to wait a long
time: in truth, a dialogue would have to have been opened between

let us say as quickly as possible--critical discourse and clinical discourse.
And the dialogue would have to have borne upon that which is beyond
their two trajectories, pointing toward the common elements of their

213

madness and the work,' driving, primarily, at their enigmatic
conjunction.
For a thousand not simply material reasons, we cannot evince, here, the
questions that these essays seem to leave unresolved, even though we
acknowledge the priority due these questions. We feel that even if, in the
best of cases, the common ground of the two discourses-the medical
commentary and the other one-has been designated from afar, in fact
the two have never been confused in any text. (And is this so because we are
concerned, first of all, with commentary? Let us throw
out these questions in order to see, further on, where Artaud necessarily
makes them land.)
We have said in fact. Describing the "extraordinarily rapid oscillations"
which in [Laplanche's] Holderlin et In question du pere produce the illusion of
unity, "permitting, in both senses, the imperceptible transfer of analogical
figures," and the crossing of the "domain included betweeen poetic forms
and psychological structures," Michel Foucault concludes that a principled
and essential conjunction of the two is impossible. Far from brushing aside
this impossibility, he posits that it proceeds from a kind of infinite
closeness: "Despite the fact that these two discourses have a demonstrably
identical content which can always be transferred from one to the other,
they are profoundly incompatible. A conjoined deciphering of poetic and
psychological structures will never reduce the distance between them.
And yet, they are always infinitely close to one another, just as is close to
something possible the possibility that founds it; the continuity of meaning
between the work and madness is possible only on the basis of the enigma of the
some which permits the absoluteness of the rupture between them to appear." But
Foucault adds a little further on: "And this is not an abstract figuration but a
historical relationship in which our culture must question itself"' Could
not the fully historical field of this interrogation, in which the overlapping of
the two discourses is as much to be constituted as it is to be restored, show
us how something that is impossible de facto

origin and their horizon. Happily for us, this horizon and this origin;'
Michel Foucault, and Jean Laplanche have questioned the problematic
passing of a discourse which, without doubling itself, without even
distributing itself (along the division between the critical and the
clinical), but with a single and simple characteristic speaks of

could present itself as impossible de jute? It would still be necessary to
conceive historicity, and the difference between the two impossi
bilities, in an unexpected way, and this initial task is not the easiest. This
historicity, long since eliminated from thought, cannot be more
thoroughly erased than at the moment when commentary, that is,

214

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

precisely, the "deciphering of structures," has commenced its reign and
determined the position of the question. This moment is even more
absent from our memory in that it is not within history.
We feel, indeed, that if clinical commentary and critical commentary
everywhere demand their own autonomy and wish to be acknowledged and respected by one another, they are no less complicit-by
virtue of a unity which refers, through as yet unconceived mediations, to
the mediation we sought an instant ago-in the same abstraction, the
same misinterpretation and the same violence. At the moment when
criticism (be it aesthetic, literary, philosophical, etc.) allegedly protects
the meaning of a thought or the value of a work against
psychomedical reductions, it comes to the same result [that a reduction
would come to] through the opposite path: it creates an example. That is to say,
a case. A work or an adventure of thought is made to bear witness, as
example or martyr, to a structure whose essential permanence
becomes the prime preoccupation of the commentary. For criticism to
make a case of meaning or of value, to take them seriously, is to
read an essence into the example which is falling between the
phenomenological brackets. And this happens according to the most
irrepressible movement of even the commentary which most respects the
untamed singularity of its theme. Although they are radically opposed for
good reasons that are well known, the psychological reduction and the eidetic reduction
function in the same way when confronted with the problem of the work or
of madness, and unwittingly pursue the same end. Assuming that
psychopathology, whatever its style, could attain in its reading the sure
profundity of a Blanchot, whatever mastery it could gain of the case of
Artaud would result in the same neutralization of "poor M.
Antonin Artaud." Whose entire adventure, in Le livre d venir, becomes
exemplary In question is a reading-an admirable one, moreover-of
the "unpower" (Artaud speaking of himself) "essential to thought"
(Blanchot). "It is as if, despite himself and through a pathetic error
from whence come his cries, he touched upon the point at which to

think is always already to be able to think no more: 'unpower,' as he calls
it, which is as if essential to thought."' The pathetic error is that part of
the example which belongs to Artaud himself: it will not be retained in
the decoding of the essential truth. The error is Artaud's history, his
erased trace on the way to truth. A pre-Hegelian concept of the

LA PAROLE 5OUFFLEE

215

relations between truth, error, and history.' "That poetry is linked to this
impossibility of thought which is thought itself, is the truth that cannot be
revealed, for it always turns away, thereby obliging him to experience it
below the point at which he would truly experience it."5 Artaud's pathetic
error: the weight of example and existence which keeps him remote from
the truth he hopelessly indicates: the nothingness at the heart of the
word, the "lack of being," the "scandal of thought separated from life,"
etc. That which belongs to Artaud without recourse-his experience
itself-can without harm be abandoned by the critic and left to the
psychologists or doctors. But "for our sake, we must not make the mistake
of reading the precise, sure, and scrupulous descriptions he gives us of this
state as psychological analyses." That which no longer belongs to
Artaud, as soon as we can read it through him, and thereby articulate,
repeat, and take charge of it, that to which Artaud is only a witness, is a
universal essence of thought. Artaud's entire adventure is purportedly
only the index of a transcendental structure: "For never will Artaud
accept the scandal of thought separated from life, even when he is given
over to the most direct and untamed experience ever undergone of the
essence of thought understood as separation, the experience of
thought's inability to affirm anything opposed to itself as the limit of its
infinite power."' Thought separated from life-this is, as is well known, one
of the great figurations of the mind of which Hegel gave several
examples.' Artaud, thus, would be another.
And Blanchot's meditation stops there: without questioning for
themselves either that which irreducibly amounts to Artaud, or the
idiosyncratic affirmation' which supports the nonacceptance of this
scandal, or what is "untamed" in this experience. His meditation stops
there or almost: it gives itself just the time to invoke a temptation
which would have to be avoided but which, in fact, never has been: "It would be
tempting to juxtapose what Artaud tells us with what Holderlin and
Mallarme tell us: that inspiration is primarily the pure point at which it is
missing. But we must resist the temptation to make overgeneralized
affirmations. Each poet says the same, which, however, is not the same, is the
unique, we feel. What is Artaud's is his alone. What he says has an intensity
that we should not bear" And in the concluding lines that follow
nothing is said of the unique. We return to

216

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

essentiality: "When we read these pages, we learn what we cannot ever
come to learn: that the fact of thinking can only be overwhelming; that
what is to be thought is that which turns away from thought within
thought, inexhaustibly exhausting itself within thought; that to suffer
and to think are linked in a secret way."9 Why this return to essentiality?
Because, by definition, there is nothing to say about the unique? We
will not rush toward this too solid commonplace here.
Blanchot must have been even more tempted to assimilate Artaud
and Holderlin in that his text devoted to the latter, La folie par excellence,10 is
advanced within the same framework. While asserting the necessity of
escaping the alternative of the two discourses ("for the mystery stems
also from this simultaneously double reading of an event which, however, is
no more situated in one than in the other of the two versions," and
primarily because this event is a demonic one which "keeps itself outside
the opposition sickness-health"), Blanchot narrows the field of medical
knowledge which misses the singularity of the event and masters every
surprise in advance. "For medical knowledge, this event is in 'the rules,'
or at least is not surprising; it corresponds to what is known about
patients inspired to write by nightmare" (p. 15). This reduction of the clinical
reduction is an essentialist reduction. While protesting, here too, against
"over-generalized ... formulations," Blanchot writes: "One cannot be
content with viewing Holderlin's fate as that of an admirable or sublime
individuality which, having too strongly desired something great, had to go
to the breaking point. His fate belongs only to him, but he himself
belongs to what he has expressed and discovered, which exists not as his
alone, but as the truth and affirmation of the essence of poetry ... He does not
decide upon his fate but upon the fate of poetry, the meaning of the truth
that he has set out to achieve.... and this movement is not his alone but the
very achievement of truth, which, despite him, at a certain point
demands that his personal reason become the pure impersonal tran
scendence from which there is no return" (p. 26). Thus the unique is
hailed in vain; it is indeed the very element which disappears from this
commentary. And not by chance. The disappearance of unicity is even
presented as the meaning of the truth of Holderlin: "Authentic speech,
the speech that mediates because the mediator disappears within it,
puts an end to its particularities and returns to the element from

LA PAROLE SOUFFLeE

217

whence it came" (p. 30). And thus, what authorizes one to say "the
poet" instead of Holderlin, what authorizes this dissolution of the
unique is a conception of the unity or unicity of the unique-here the
unity of madness and the work-as conjunction, composition or
"combination": "A like combination is not encountered twice" (p. 20).
Jean Laplanche reproaches Blanchot for his "idealist interpretation,"
"resolutely anti-'scientific' and anti-'psychological' " and proposes to
substitute another type of unitary theory for the theory of Hellingrath,
which Blanchot, despite his own differences, also leans toward." Not
wanting to renounce unitarism, Laplanche wants "to include
within a single movement his [Holderlin's] work, and his evolution
toward and within madness, even if this movement has the scansion of a
dialectic and the multilinearity of counterpoint" (p. 13). In fact, one
very quickly realizes that this "dialectic" scansion and this multilinearity do
nothing but, as Foucault correctly says, increase the rapidity of oscillations,
until the rapidity is difficult to perceive. At the end of the book, we are
still out of breath searching for the unique, which itself, as such, eludes
discourse and always will elude it: "The assimilation of the evolution of
schizophrenia to the evolution of the work that we are proposing leads to
results which absolutely cannot be generalized: in question is the
relationship of poetry to mental illness within a particular, perhaps
unique, case" (p. 132). Again, a conjoined and chance unicity. For,
once one has from afar even mentioned it as such, one returns to the
expressly criticized exemplarism'2 of Blanchot. The psychological style and,
opposed to it, the structuralist or essentialist style have almost totally
disappeared, certainly, and the philosophical gesture is seductive: it is no
longer a question of understanding the poet Holderlin on the basis of a
schizophrenic or a transcendental structure whose meaning would be
known to us, and which would hold in store no surprises. On the
contrary, in Holderlin we must read, and see designated, an access, the
best one perhaps, an exemplary access to the essence of schizophrenia in
general. And this essence of schizophrenia is not a psychological or
anthropological fact available to the determined sciences called
psychology or anthropology: "It is he [Holderlin] who reopens the
question of schizophrenia as a universal problem" (p.133). A universal and
not only human problem, not a primarily human problem because a true
anthropology could be

218

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

constituted upon the possibility of schizophrenia-which does not mean
that the possibility of schizophrenia can in fact be encountered in beings
other than man. Schizophrenia simply is not one among other attributes
of an essence of man that would have to be constituted and acknowledged
as the prerequisite basis of the study of man. Just as "in certain societies,
the accession to Law, to the Symbolic has fallen to institutions other than
that of the father" (p. 133)-whose precomprehension the institution of
paternity thus permits-similarly, analogically, schizophrenia is not one
among other dimensions or possibilities of the existent called man, but
indeed the structure that opens the truth of man. This opening is produced
in an exemplary way in the case of Holderlin. It could be thought that, by
definition, the unique cannot be an example or case of a universal figure.
But it can. Exemplarity only apparently contradicts unicity. The
equivocality lodged in the notion of example is well known: it is the
resource of the complicity between clinical discourse and critical
discourse, the complicity between the discourse which reduces meaning or
value and the one that attempts to restore them. This is what permits
Foucault to conclude for his purposes: "Holderlin occupies a unique and
exemplary place" (p. 209).
Such is the case that has been made of Holderlin and Artaud. Our
intention is above all not to refute or to criticize the principle of these
readings. They are legitimate, fruitful, true; here, moreover, they are
admirably executed, and informed by a critical vigilance which makes us
make immense progress. If, on the other hand, we seem unsure of the
treatment reserved for the unique, it is not because we think, and this
credit will have to be granted us, that subjective existence, the
originality of the work or the singularity of the beautiful, must be
protected against the violence of the concept by means of moral or
aesthetic precautions. No, inversely, when we appear to regret a silence or
defeat before the unique, it is because we believe in the necessity of
reducing the unique, of analyzing it and decomposing it by shattering it
even further. Better: we believe that no commentary can escape these
defeats, unless it destroys itself as commentary by exhuming the unity in
which is embedded the differences (of madness and the work, of the
psyche and the text, of example and essence, etc.) which implicitly
support both criticism and the clinic. This ground, which we are
approaching only by the negative route here, is historical in a sense

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

which, it seems to us, has never been given thematic value in the
commentaries of which we have just spoken, and which truthfully can
hardly be tolerated by the metaphysical concept of history. The tumultuous presence of this archaic ground will thus magnetize the discourse
which will be attracted into the resonance of the cries of Anton in Artaud.
Will be attracted from afar, again, for our initial stipulation of naivete was
not a stipulation of style.
And if we say, to begin, that Artaud teaches us this unity prior to
dissociation, we do not say so in order to construe Artaud as an
example of what he teaches. If we understand him, we expect no
instruction from him. Also, the preceding considerations are in no way
methodological prologomena or generalizations announcing a new
treatment of the case of Artaud. Rather, they indicate the very question that
Artaud wants to destroy from its root, the question whose derivativeness,
if not impossibility, he indefatigably denounced, upon which his cries
furiously and unceasingly hurled themselves. For what his howls
promise us, articulating themselves under the headings of existence, flesh,
life, theater, cruelty is the meaning of an art prior to madness and the work, an art
which no longer yields works, an artist's existence which is no longer a
route or an experience that gives access to something other than itself;
Artaud promises the existence of a speech that is a body, of a body that is a
theater, of a theater that is a text because it is no longer enslaved to a
writing more ancient than itself, an ur-text or an ur-speech. If Artaud
absolutely resists-and, we believe, as was never done before-clinical or
critical exegeses, he does so by virtue of that part of his adventure (and
with this word we are designating a totality anterior to the separation of
the life and the work) which is the very protest itself against exemplification
itself. The critic and the doctor are without resource when confronted by an
existence that refuses to signify, or by an art without works, a language
without a trace. That is to say, without difference. In pursuit of a
manifestation which would not be an expression but a pure creation of
life, which would not fall far from the body then to decline into a sign
or a work, an object, Artaud attempted to destroy a history, the history of
the dualist metaphysics which more or less subterraneously inspired the
essays invoked above: the duality of the body and the soul which supports,
secretly of

219

220

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

course, the duality of speech and existence, of the text and the body, etc.
The metaphysics of the commentary which authorized "commentaries"
because it already governed the works commented upon. Nontheatrical
works, in the sense understood by Artaud, works that are already deported
commentaries. Beating his flesh in order to reawaken it at the eve prior to
the deportation, Artaud attempted to forbid that his speech be spirited
away [souffle]" from his body.
Spirited [soufe]: let us understand stolen by a possible commentator who
would acknowledge speech in order to place it in an order, an order of
essential truth or of a real structure, psychological or other. The first
commentator, here, is the reader or the listener, the receiver
which the "public" must no longer be in the theater of cruelty."
Artaud knew that all speech fallen from the body, offering itself to
understanding or reception, offering itself as a spectacle, immediately
becomes stolen speech. Becomes a signification which I do not possess
because it is a signification. Theft is always the theft of speech or text,
of a trace. The theft of a possession does not become a theft unless the
thing stolen is a possession, unless it has acquired meaning and value
through, at least, the consecration of a vow made in discourse. And this
proposition could only foolishly be interpreted as the dismissal of
every other theory of theft advanced within the order of morals, eco
nomics, or politics. For this proposition is anterior to such discourses,
because it explicitly, and within a single question, establishes com
munication between the essence of theft and the origin of discourse in
general. Now every discourse on theft, each time that it is determined
by a given set of circumstances, has already obscurely resolved or
repressed this question, has already reassured itself into the familiarity
of an initial knowledge: everyone knows what theft means. But the
theft of speech is not a theft among others; it is confused with the very
possibility of theft, defining the fundamental structure of theft. And if
Artaud makes us think this, it is no longer as the example of a structure,
because in question is the very thing-theft-which constitutes the
structure of the example as such.
Spirited [Souffle]: at the same time let us understand inspired by an other voice
that itself reads a text older than the text of my body or than the theater of my
gestures. Inspiration is the drama, with several characters, of theft, the
structure of the classical theater in which the invisibility of

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

221

the prompter [souffleur] ensures the indispensable diflerance and intermittence
between a text already written by another hand and an interpreter
already dispossessed of that which he receives. Artaud desired the
conflagration of the stage upon which the prompter [souffleur] was possible
and where the body was under the rule of a foreign text. Artaud wanted
the machinery of the prompter [souffleur] spirited away [souflle], wanted to
plunder the structure of theft. To do so, he had to destroy, with one and
the same blow, both poetic inspiration and the economy of classical art,
singularly the economy of the theater. And through the same blow he had
to destroy the metaphysics, religion, aesthetics, etc., that supported them.
He would thus open up to Danger a world no longer sheltered by the
structure of theft. To restore Danger by reawakening the stage of crueltythis was Antonin Artaud's stated intention, at very least. It is this intention
that we will follow here, with the exception of a calculated slip.
Unpower, which appears thematically in the letters to Jacques Riviere,15
is not, as is known, simple impotence, the sterility of having "nothing to
say, or the lack of inspiration. On the contrary, it is inspiration itself: the
force of a void, the cyclonic breath [souffle] of a prompter [souffleur]
who draws his breath in, and thereby robs me of that which he first
allowed to approach me and which I believed I could say in my own
name. The generosity of inspiration, the positive irruption of a speech which
comes from I know not where, or about which I know (if I am Antonin
Artaud) that I do not know where it comes from or who speaks it, the
fecundity of the other breath [souffle] is unpower: not the absence but the
radical irresponsibility of speech, irresponsibility as the power and the
origin of speech. I am in relation to myself within the ether of a speech
which is always spirited away [souffle] from me, and which steals from me
the very thing that it puts me in relation to. Consciousness of speech, that is
to say, consciousness in general is not knowing who speaks at the moment
when, and in the place where, I proffer my speech. This consciousness is
thus also an unconsciousness ("In my unconsciousness it is others whom
I hear," 1946), in opposition to which another consciousness will
necessarily have to be reconstituted; and this time, consciousness will be
cruelly present to itself and will hear itself speak. It is within the province
of neither morals, nor logic, nor aesthetics to define this irresponsibility:

222

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

it is a total and original loss of existence itself. According to Artaud it
also, and primarily, occurs in my Body, in my Life-expressions whose sense
must be understood beyond any metaphysical determinations and beyond
the "limitations of being" which separated body from soul, speech from
gesture, etc. Loss, precisely, is the metaphysical determination into which
I will have to slip my works if they are to be understood within a world
and a literature unwittingly governed by the metaphysics for which
Jacques Riviere served as delegate. "Here, too, I fear a misunderstanding. I
would like you to realize that it is not a matter of the higher or lower
existence involved in what is known as inspiration, but of a total
absence, of a veritable dwindling away" (Artaud Anthology, [San Francisco,
1965; hereafter AA], p. 8). Artaud ceaselessly repeated this: the origin and
urgency of speech, that which impelled him into expression, was
confused with his own lack of speech, with "having nothing to say" in
his own name. "The dispersiveness of my poems, their formal defects, the
constant sagging of my thinking, are to be attributed not to lack of practice,
of mastery of the instrument I wield, of intellectual development, but to a central
collapse of the mind, to a kind of erosion, both essential and fleeting, of
my thinking, to the passing nonpossession of the material gains of my
development, to the abnormal separation of the elements of thought
.. There is thus something that is destroying my thinking, a something which does not prevent me from being what I might be, but
which leaves me, if I may say so, in abeyance. A something furtive
which takes away from me the words which I have found" (AA, pp. 10-11;
Artaud's italics).
It would be tempting, easy, and, to a certain extent, legitimate to
underline the exemplarity of this description. The "essential" and
"fleeting" erosion, "both essential and fleeting," is produced by the
"something furtive which takes away from me the words which I have
found." The furtive is fleeting, but it is more than fleeting. Furtivenessin
Latin-is the manner of the thief, who must act very quickly in order
to steal from me the words which I have found. Very quickly, because
he must invisibly slip into the nothing that separates me from my words,
and must purloin them before I have even found them, so

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

always empties out speech as it eludes itself Spoken language has
erased the reference to theft from the word "furtive," the subtle subterfuge
which makes signification slip-and this is the theft of theft, the
furtiveness that eludes itself through a necessary gesture-toward an
invisible and silent contact with the fugitive, the fleeting and the fleeing.
Artaud neither ignores nor emphasizes the proper sense of the word, but
stays within the movement of erasure: in Nerve-Scales, apropos of "wasting,"
"loss," "traps in our thought" he speaks, without being simply redundant,
of "stealthy abductions" (rapes furtifs) (Collected Works [London, 1971;
hereafter CW], 1:70-71).
As soon as I speak, the words I have found (as soon as they are words) no
longer belong to me, are originally repeated (Artaud desires a theater in
which repetition16 is impossible. CE The Theater and its Double [New York,
1958; hereafter TD], p. 82). I must first hear myself In soliloquy as in
dialogue, to speak is to hear oneself As soon as I am heard, as soon as I
hear myself, the I who hears itself who hears me, becomes the I who
speaks and takes speech from the I who thinks that he speaks and is heard
in his own name; and becomes the I who takes speech without ever cutting off
the I who thinks that he speaks. Insinuating itself into the name of the
person who speaks, this difference is nothing, is furtiveness itself: it is the
structure of instantaneous and original elusion without which no speech
could ever catch its breath [souffle]. Elusion is produced as the original
enigma, that is to say, as the speech or history (ainos) which hides its origin
and meaning; it never says where it is going, nor where it is coming from,
primarily because it does not know where it is coming from or going
to, and because this not knowing, to wit, the absence of its own
subject, is not subsequent to

this enigma but, rather, constitutes it. Elusion is the initial unity of that
stand elusion as rapt or as rape exclusively or fundamentally is within the
province of a psychology, an anthropology, or a metaphysics of
subjectivity (consciousness, unconsciousness, or the individual body). No
doubt that this metaphysics is powerfully at work in Artaud's
thought.
Henceforth, what is called the speaking subject is no longer the

divested of them. Furtiveness is thus the quality of dispossession which

2,

person himself, or the person alone, who speaks. The speaking subject
discovers his irreducible secondarity, his origin that is always already

2 24

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

eluded; for the origin is always already eluded on the basis of an
organized field of speech in which the speaking subject vainly seeks a
place that is always missing. This organized field is not uniquely a field that
could be described by certain theories of the psyche or of linguistic
fact. It is first-but without meaning anything else-the cultural field
from which I must draw my words and my syntax, the historical field
which I must read by writing on it. The structure of theft already lodges
(itself in) the relation of speech to language. Speech is stolen: since it is
stolen from language it is, thus, stolen from itself, that is, from the thief
who has always already lost speech as property and initiative. Because
its forethought cannot be predicted, the act of reading perforates the act
of speaking or writing. And through this perforation, this hole, I escape
myself. The form of the hole-which mobilizes the discourse of a certain
existentialism and a certain psychoanalysis for which "poor M. Antonin
Artaud" provides examples-communicates with a scatotheological
thematic in Artaud's works which we will examine later. That speech and
writing are always unavowably taken from a reading is the form of the
original theft, the most archaic elusion, which simultaneously hides me and
purloins my powers of inauguration. The mind purloins. The letter," inscribed
or propounded speech, is always stolen. Always stolen because it is
always open. It never belongs to its author or to its addressee, and by nature,
it never follows the trajectory that leads from subject to subject. Which
amounts to acknowledging the autonomy of the signifier as the letter's
historicity; before me, the signifier on its own says more than I believe
that I mean to say, and in relation to it, my meaning-to-say is submis
sive rather than active. My meaning-to-say finds itself lacking some
thing in relation to the signifier, and is inscribed passively, we might
say, even if the reflection of this lack determines the urgency of expres
sion as excess: the autonomy of the signifier as the stratification and
historical potentialization of meaning, as a historical system, that is, a
system that is open at some point." The oversignification which
overburdens the word "spirit" [souffle], for example, has not finished
illustrating this.

Let us not overextend the banal description of this structure. Artaud
does not exemplify it. He wants to explode it. He opposes to this
inspiration of loss and dispossession a good inspiration, the very

LA PAROLE 5OUFFLEE

225

inspiration that is missing from inspiration as loss. Good inspiration is
the spirit-breath [souffle] of life, which will not take dictation because it does
not read and because it precedes all texts. It is the spirit [souffle]
that would take possession of itself in a place where property would not
yet be theft. This inspiration would return me to true communication with
myself and would give me back speech: "The difficult part is to find out
exactly where one is, to re-establish communication with one's self The
whole thing lies in a certain flocculation of objects, the gathering of these
mental gems about one as yet undiscovered (a trouver) nucleus. /Here,
then, is what I think of thought: / I N S P I R A T I O N CERTAINLY EXISTS" (CW
1:72) The expression "as yet undiscovered" [a trouver] will later punctuate
another page. It will then be time to wonder whether Artaud does not
thereby designate, each time, the undiscoverable itself
If we wish to gain access to this metaphysics of life, then life, as the
source of good inspiration, must be understood as prior to the life of
which the biological sciences speak: "Furthermore, when we speak the
word 'life,' it must be understood we are not referring to life as we
know it from its surface of fact, but that fragile, fluctuating center
which forms never reach. And if there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing
in our time, it is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being like
victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames" (TD, p.13).
Life referred to "from its surface of fact" is thus the life of forms. In Situation
of the Flesh Artaud will oppose to it "the life-force"" (CW 1:165). The theater
of cruelty will have to reduce this difference between force and form.
What we have just called elusion is not an abstraction for Artaud. The
category of furtiveness is not valid solely for the disincarnated voice or for
writing. If difference, within its phenomenon, is the sign of theft or of the
purloined breath [souffle], it is primarily, if not in itself, the total
dispossession which constitutes me as the deprivation of myself, the
elusion of my existence, and this makes difference the simultaneous theft
of both my body and my mind: my flesh. If my speech is not my breath
[souffle], if my letter is not my speech, this is so because my spirit was
already no longer my body, my body no longer my gestures, my
gestures no longer my life. The integrity of the flesh torn by all these
differences must be restored in the theater. Thus the metaphysics of

226 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

flesh which determines Being as life, and the mind as the body itself, as
unseparated thought, "obscure" thinking (for "Clear mind is a property
of matter," CW 1:165)-this is the continuous and always unperceived
trait which links The Theater and Its Double to the early works and to the theme
of unpower. This metaphysics of the flesh is also governed by the
anguish of dispossession, the experience of having lost life, of separation
from thought, of the body exiled far from the mind. Such is the initial cry.
"I am reflecting on life. All the systems I could devise would never equal
these cries by a man occupied in rebuilding his life .... My reason will
certainly one day have to receive these unformulated forces exteriorly
shaped like a cry which are besieging me, and they may then supplant
higher thought. These are intellectual cries, cries which stem from the
marrow's delicacy. This is what I personally call the Flesh. I do not
separate my thought from my life .... But what am I in the midst of this
theory about the Flesh or more
correctly, Existence? I am a man who has lost his life and who is
seeking every way of re-integrating it in its proper place .... But I
must look into this aspect of the flesh which is supposed to give me
a metaphysics of Being and a positive understanding of life" (CW
1:164-65)
Let us not be detained here by a possible resemblance to the essence of
the mythic itself: the dream of a life without difference. Let us ask, rather,
what difference within the flesh might mean for Artaud. My body has
been stolen from me by effraction. The Other, the Thief, the great Furtive
One, has a proper name: God. His history has taken place. It has its own
place. The place of effraction can be only the opening of an orifice. The
orifice of birth, the orifice of defecation to which all other gaps refer, as if
to their origin. "It is filled, / it is not filled, / there is a void, / a lack / a
missing something / which is always taken by a parasite on flight"
(August 1947). Flight: the pun is certain.
Ever since I have had a relation to my body, therefore, ever since my
birth, I no longer am my body. Ever since I have had a body I am not
this body, hence I do not possess it. This deprivation institutes and
informs my relation to my life. My body has thus always been stolen
from me. Who could have stolen it from me, if not an Other, and how
could he have gotten hold of it from the beginning unless he had
slipped into my place inside my mother's belly, unless I had been stolen

LA PAROLE SOU FFLEE

227

from my birth, unless my birth had been purloined from me, "as if
being born has for a long time smelled of dying"? (84, p.1 1) Death yields
to conceptualization within the category of theft; it is not what we believe
we can anticipate as the termination of the process or adventure that we
(assuredly) call life. Death is an articulated form of our relationship to the
Other. I die only of the other: through him, for him, in him. My death
is represented, let one modify this word as one will. And if I die by
representation, then at the "extreme moment of death" this representative
theft has not any less shaped the entirety of my existence, from its origin.
This is why, in the last extremity " . . . one does not commit suicide
alone. / No one was ever born alone. / Nor has anyone died alone ... / ...
And I believe that there is always someone else, at the extreme moment of
death, to strip us of our own life" (AA, pp. 16162). The theme of
death as theft is at the center of "La mort et 1'homme" (Sur un dessin
de Rodez, in 84, no. 13).
And who could the thief be if not the great invisible Other, the
furtive persecutor who doubles me everywhere, that is, redoubles and
surpasses me, always arrives before me where I have chosen to go, like "the
body which pursued me" (persecuted me) "and did not follow"
(preceded me)-who could he be if not God? "A ND WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE WITH MY BODY, G O D ? " (84, p. 108). And here is the
answer: ever since the black hole of my birth, god has "flayed me alive /
during my entire existence / and has done so / uniquely because of the
fact that / it is I / who was god, / truly god, / I a man / and not the socalled ghost / who was only the projection into the clouds / of the
body of a man other than myself, / who called himself the / Demiurge /
Now, the hideous history of the Demiurge / is well known / It is the
history of the body / which pursued (and did not follow) mine / and
which, in order to go first and be born, / projected itself across my
body / and / was born / through the disemboweling of my body / of
which he kept a piece / in order to / pass himself off / as me. / Now,
there was no one but he and I, / he / an abject body / unwanted by
space, / I / a body being mad / consequently not yet having reached
completion / but evolving / toward integral purity / like the body of the
so-called Demiurge, / who, knowing that he has no chance of being
received / and yet wanting to live at any price, I found nothing better / in
order to be / than to be born at the price of my assassination.

2 28

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

/ Despite everything, my body reshaped itself / against and through a
thousand attacks of evil / and of hatred / which each time deteriorated him /
and left me dead. / And it is thus that through dying / I have come to
achieve real immortality. / And / this is the true story of things / as
they really happened / and not / as seen in the legendary atmosphere of
myths / which obscure reality" (84, pp. 108-10).
God is thus the proper name of that which deprives us of our own
nature, of our own birth; consequently he will always have spoken
before us, on the sly. He is the difference which insinuates itself
between myself and myself as my death. This is why-such is the
concept of true suicide according to Artaud-I must die away from my
death in order to be reborn "immortal" at the eve of my birth. God does
not take hold of any one of our innate attributes, but of our innateness
itself, of the innateness proper to our being itself: "There are some fools who
think of themselves as beings, as innately being. / I am he who, in order to
be, must whip his innateness. / One who must be a being innately, that is,
always whipping this sort of nonexistent kennel, 0! bitches of impossibility"
(CW, 1: 19).
Why is this original alienation conceived as pollution, obscenity,
"filthiness," etc.? Why does Artaud, bemoaning the loss of his body,
lament a loss of purity as much as he laments dispossession, lament the loss
of propriety as much as the loss of property? "I have been tortured too
much ... / ... / I have worked too hard at being pure and strong / ... / I have
sought to have a proper body too much" (84, p. 135).
By definition, I have been robbed of my possessions, my worth, my
value. My truth, what I am worth, has been purloined from me by
some One who in my stead became God at the exit from the Orifice, at
birth. God is false value as the initial worth of that which is born. And this
false value becomes Value, because it has always already doubled true value
which has never existed, or, amounting to the same thing, existed only prior
to its own birth. Henceforth, original value, the ur-value that I should have
retained within myself, or rather should have retained as myself, as my
value and my very being, that which was stolen from me as soon as I fell far
from the Orifice, and which is stolen from me again each time that a part
of me falls far from myself-this is the work, excrement, dross, the
value that is annulled because it has not been
retained, and which can become, as is well known, a persecuting arm,

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

229

an arm eventually directed against myself Defecation, the "daily separation
with the feces, precious parts of the body" (Freud), is, as birth, as my birth,
the initial theft which simultaneously depreciates 20 me and soils me. This
is why the history of God as a genealogy of stolen value is recounted as the
history of defecation. "Do you know anything more outrageously fecal /
than the history of God ..." ("Le theatre de la cruaute," in 84, p. 121).
It is perhaps due to God's complicity with the origin of the work that
Artaud also calls him the Demiurge. In question is a metonym of the
name of God, the proper name of the thief and the metaphorical name
of myself: the metaphor of myself is my dispossession within language.
In any event, God-the-Demiurge does not create, is not life, but is the
subject of teuvres and maneuvers, is the thief, the trickster, the counterfeiter,
the pseudonymous, the usurper, the opposite of the creative artist, the
artisanal being, the being of the artisan: Satan. I am God and God is Satan;
and as Satan is part of God's creation (... "the history of God / of his being:
SATAN . . . " in 84, p. 121), God is of my own creation, my double who
slipped into the difference that separates me from my origin, that is, into
the nothing that opens my history. What is called the presence of God is
but the forgetting of this nothing, the eluding of elusion, which is not an
accident but the very movement of elusion: " . . . Satan, / who with his
overflowing nipples / hid from us / only Nothingness?" (ibid.).
This history of God is thus the history of the work as excrement.
Scato-logy itself The work, as excrement, supposes separation and is
produced within separation. The work thus proceeds from the separation
of the mind from a pure body. It belongs to the mind, and to relocate
an unpolluted body is to reconstitute oneself as a body without a work.
"For one must have a mind in order / to shit, / a pure body cannot /
shit. / What it shits / is the glue of minds / furiously determined to
steal something from him / for without a body one cannot exist" (84, p.
113). One can read in Nerve-Scales: "Dear Friends, What you took to be my
works were only my waste matter" (CW 1:72).
My work, my trace, the excrement that robs me of my possessions after
I have been stolen from my birth, must thus be rejected. But to reject it is not,
here, to refuse it but to retain it. To keep myself, to keep my body and
my speech, I must retain the work within me, 21 conjoin

230

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

myself with it so that there will be no opportunity for the Thief to
come between it and me: it must be kept from falling far from my body
as writing. For "writing is all trash" (CW 1:75). Thus, that which
dispossesses me and makes me remote from myself, interrupting my
proximity to myself, also soils me: I relinquish all that is proper to me.
Proper is the name of the subject close to himself-who is what he
is-and abject the name of the object, the work that has deviated from me.
I have a proper name when I am proper. The child does not
appropriate his true name in Western society-initially in school-is not
well named until he is proper, clean, toilet-trained. The unity of these
significations, hidden beneath their apparent dispersion, the unity of the
proper as the nonpollution of the subject absolutely close to himself, does
not occur before the Latin era of philosophy (proprius is attached to proper);
and, for the same reason, the metaphysical determination of madness as
the disease of alienation could not have begun its development before this
era. (It goes without saying that we are not construing the linguistic
phenomenon as a cause or a symptom: the concept of madness, quite
simply, is solidified only during the era of the metaphysics of a proper
subjectivity.) Artaud solicits this metaphysics, shakes it when it lies to itself
and establishes the proper departure from that which is proper to oneself (the
alienation of alienation) as the condition for the phenomenon of the
proper; and Artaud still summons this metaphysics, draws upon its fund
of values, and attempts to be more faithful to it than it is to itself by
means of an absolute restoration of the proper to the eve prior to all
dissociation.
Like excrement, like the turd, which is, as is also well known, a
metaphor of the penis,d2 the work should stand upright. But the work, as
excrement, is but matter without life, without force or form. It always falls
and collapses as soon as it is outside me. This is why the work-be it poetic
or other-will never help me stand upright. I will never be erect in it.
Thus salvation, status, uprightness will be possible only in an art without
works. The work always being the work of death, the art without works
dance or the theater of cruelty-will be the art of life itself "I have
therefore said 'cruelty' as I might have said 'life"' (TD, p. 114).
Rigid with rage against God, convulsed with anger against the work,
Artaud does not renounce salvation. On the contrary, soteriology will

LA PAROLE SOUFFLE`E 231

be the eschatology of one's proper body. "It is the state of my / body
which will make / the Last Judgment" (84, p. 13 1). One's-properbodyupright-without-detritus. Evil, pollution, resides in the critical or the
clinical: it is to have one's speech and body become works, objects which
can be offered up to the furtive haste of the commentator because
they are supine. For, by definition, the only thing that is not subject to
commentary is the life of the body, the living flesh whose integrity,
opposed to evil and death, is maintained by the theater. Disease is the
impossibility of standing upright in dance and in the theater. "There is
plague, / cholera / smallpox / only because dance / and consequently
theater / have not yet begun to exist" (84, p.127).
The tradition of mad poets? Holderlin: "Yet, fellow poets, us it
behoves to stand / Bare headed beneath God's thunderstorms, / To
grasp the Father's rays, no less, with our own two hands / And, wrapping
in song the heavenly gift, / To offer it to the people."Nietzsche:
24 need I add that one must also be able to dance with the pen
' Or further: "Only those thoughts that come by walking have
any value."" On this point, as on many others, one could be tempted
to envelop these three mad poets, in the company of several others,
within the thrust of a single commentary and the continuity of a single
genealogy." A thousand other texts on standing upright and on the
dance could effectively encourage such a project. But would it not then
miss Artaud's essential decision? From Holderlin to Nietzsche, stand
ing upright and the dance remain metaphorical, perhaps. In any event,
erection is not obliged to exile itself into the work or to delegate itself
to the poem, to expatriate itself into the sovereignty of speech or
writing, into the literal uprightness of the letter or the tip of the pen.
The uprightness of the work, to be more precise, is the reign of literal
ity over breath [souffle]. Nietzsche had certainly denounced the gram
matical structure embedded within a metaphysics to be demolished;
but, did he ever question, as to its origin, the relationship between
grammatical security, which he acknowledged, and the uprightness of
the letter? Heidegger foretells this relationship in a brief suggestion in
the Introduction to Metaphysics: "In a certain broad sense the Greeks looked
on language from a visual point of view, that is, starting from the
written language. It is in writing that the spoken language comes to
stand. Language is, i.e. it stands, in the written image of the word, in

the written signs, the letters, grammata. Consequently, grammar represents
language in being. But through the flow of speech language seeps away into
the impermanent. Thus, down to our time, language has been
interpreted grammatically."" This does not contradict, but confirms,
paradoxically, the disdain of writing which, in the Phaedrus for example, saves
metaphorical writing as the initial inscription of truth upon the soul-saves
it and initially refers to it as to the most assured knowledge and the
proper meaning of writing (276a).
It is metaphor that Artaud wants to destroy. He wishes to have done
with standing upright as metaphorical erection within the written
work." This alienation of the written work into metaphor is a phenomenon that belongs to superstition. And "We must get rid of our
superstitious valuation of texts and written poetry" (TD, p. 78). Superstition
is thus the essence of our relation to God, of our persecution by
the great furtive one. The death of God 29 will ensure our salvation
because the death of God alone can reawaken the Divine. Man's
name-man as the scato-theological being, the being capable of being
soiled by the work and of being constituted by his relation to the
thieving God-designates the historical corruption of the unnamable
Divine. "And this faculty is an exclusively human one. I would even say
that it is this infection of the human which contaminates ideas that
should have remained divine; for far from believing that man invented
the supernatural and the divine, I think it is man's age-old intervention
which has ultimately corrupted the divine within him" (TD, p. 8). God
is thus a sin against the divine. The essence of guilt is scato-theological.
The body of thought in which the scato-theological essence of man
appears as such cannot simply be a metaphysical anthropology or
humanism. Rather it points to the way beyond man, beyond the meta
physics of Western theater whose "preoccupations ... stink unbeliev
ably of man, provisional, material man, I shall even say carrion man" (TD,
p. 42. Cf. also, in CW 3, the letter of insults to the Comedie-Francaise
which, in explicit terms, denounces the scatological vocation of that
institution's concept and operations).
By virtue of this rejection of the metaphorical stance within the
work, and despite several striking resemblances (here, the passage
beyond man and God), Artaud is not the son of Nietzsche. And even
less so of Holderlin. The theater of cruelty, by killing metaphor

(upright-being-outside-itself-within-the-stolen-work), pushes us into "a
new idea of Danger" (letter to Marcel Dalio in Euvres completes, [Paris, 1970],
5:95). The adventure of the Poem is the last anguish to be suppressed
before the adventure of the Theater." Before Being in its proper station.
How will the theater of cruelty save me, give me back the institution of
my flesh itself? How will it prevent my life from falling outside me? How
will it help me avoid "having lived / like the 'Demiurge' / with / a body
stolen by effraction" (84, p. 113)?
First, by summarily reducing the organ. The first gesture of the
destruction of classical theater-and the metaphysics it puts on stageis the
reduction of the organ. The classical Western stage defines a theater of
the organ, a theater of words, thus a theater of interpretation, enregistration,
and translation, a theater of deviation from the groundwork of a
preestablished text, a table written by a God-Author who is the sole
wielder of the primal word. A theater in which a master disposes of
the stolen speech which only his slaves-his directors and actors-may
make use of. "If, then, the author is the man who arranges the language of
speech and the director is his slave, there is merely a question of words.
There is here a confusion over terms, stemming from the fact that, for
us, and according to the sense generally attributed to the word director,
this man is merely an artisan, an adapter, a kind of translator eternally
devoted to making a dramatic work pass from one language into another;
this confusion will be possible, and the director will be forced to play
second fiddle to the author, only so long as there is a tacit agreement that
the language of words is superior to others and that the theater admits
none other than this one language" (TD, p. 119)." The differences upon
which the metaphysics of Occidental theater lives (author-text / directoractors), its differentiation and its divisions, transform the "slaves" into
commentators, that is, into organs. Here, they are recording organs. Now,
"We must believe in a sense of life renewed by the theater, a sense of life in
which man fearlessly makes himself master of what does not yet exist (my italics),
and brings it into being. And everything that has not been born can still
be brought to life if we are not satisfied to remain mere recording
organisms" (TD, p. 13).
But what we will call organic differentiation had already raged

within the body, before it had corrupted the metaphysics of the theater.
Organization is articulation, the interlocking of functions or of members
(artho, anus), the labor and play of their differentiation. This constitutes
both the "membering" and dismembering of my proper body. For one and
the same reason, through a single gesture, Artaud is as fearful of the
articulated body as he is of articulated language, as fearful of the
member as of the word. For articulation is the structure of my body, and
structure is always a structure of expropriation. The division of the body
into organs, the difference interior to the flesh, opens the lack through
which the body becomes absent from itself, passing itself off as, and
taking itself for, the mind. Now, "there is no mind, nothing but the
differentiation of bodies" (March, 1947). The body, which "always seeks
to reassemble itself,"" escapes itself by virtue of that which permits it
to function and to express itself; as is said of those who are ill, the body
listens to itself and, thus, disconcerts itself. "The body is the body, it is
alone / and has no need of organs, / the body is never an organism, /
organisms are the enemies of bodies, / everything one does transpires by
itself without the aid of any organ, / every organ is a parasite, it overlaps
with a parasitic function / destined to bring into existence a being which
should not be there" (84, p. 101). The organ thus welcomes the difference
of the stranger into my body: it is always the organ of my ruin, and this truth
is so original that neither the heart, the central organ of life, nor the sex, the
first organ of life, can escape it: "It is thus that there is in fact nothing more
ignominiously useless and superfluous than the organ called the heart /
which is the dirtiest means that any being could have invented for
pumping life inside me. / The movements of the heart are nothing other
than a maneuver to which being ceaselessly abandons itself above me, in
order to take from me that which I ceaselessly deny it" (84, p. 103).
Further on: "A true man has no sex" (p. 112)." A true man has no sex for
he must be his sex. As soon as the sex becomes an organ, it becomes
foreign to me,
abandons me, acquiring thereby the arrogant autonomy of a swollen
object full of itself. This swelling of the sex become a separate object is
a kind of castration. "He said he saw a great preoccupation with sex in
me. But with taut sexual organs, swollen like an object" (Art and Death,
in CW 1:108).
The organ: place of loss because its center always has the form of an

orifice. The organ always functions as an embouchure. The reconstitution
and reinstitution of my flesh will thus always follow along the lines of
my body's closing in on itself and the reduction of the organic structure: "I
was alive / and I have been here since always. / Did I eat? / No, / but when I
was hungry I retreated with my body and did not eat myself / but all that
has been decomposed, / a strange operation has taken place ... / Did I
sleep? / No, I did not sleep, / one must be chaste to know not to eat. /
To open one's mouth is to give oneself over to miasms. / No mouth, then!
/ No mouth, / no tongue, / no teeth, / no larynx, / no esophagus, / no
stomach, / no belly, / no anus. / I will reconstruct the man that I am"
(November 1947, in 84, p. 102). Further on: "(It is not especially a
question of the sex or the anus / which, moreover, are to be hewn off
and liquidated)" (84, p. 125). The reconstitution of the body must be
autarchic; it cannot be given any assistance and the body must be
remade of a single piece: "It is / I / who / I will be / remade / by me /
myself / entirely / ... by myself / who am a body / and have no regions
within me" (March 1947).
The dance of cruelty punctuates this reconstruction, and once more in
question is a place to be found: "Reality has not yet been constructed because the
true organs of the human body have not yet been assembled and put in
place. / The theater of cruelty has been created to complete this putting
into place and to undertake, through a new dance of the body of man,
the disruption of this world of microbes which is but coagulated
nothingness. / The theater of cruelty wants to make eyelids dance cheek to
cheek with elbows, patellas, femurs and toes, and to have this dance be
seen" (84, p. 101).
Thus, theater could not have been a genre among others for Artaud, who
was a man of the theater before being a writer, poet, or even a man of
the theater: an actor as much as an author, and not only because he acted a
great deal, having written but a single play, and having demonstrated
for an "aborted theater," but because theater summons the totality of
existence and no longer tolerates either the incidence of interpretation or
the distinction between actor and author. The initial urgent requirement
of an in-organic theater is emancipation from the text. Although the
rigorous system of this emancipation is found only in The Theater and Its
Double, protest against the letter had always been

236

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

Artaud's primary concern. Protest against the dead letter which absents itself
far from breath [souffle] and flesh. Artaud initially dreamed of a graphism
which would not begin as deviation, of a nonseparated inscription: an
incarnation of the letter and a bloody tatoo: "In deference to this letter
(from Jean Paulhan, 1923) I continued for a further month to work at
writing a verbally, not a grammatically, successful poem. / Then I gave up.
As far as I was concerned, the problem was not to find out what might
manage to worm its way into the structures of written language, / but
into the web of my living soul. / By which words entered like knives in
lasting carnation, / a fitting, dying incarnation under a span, the burning
island of a gallows lantern" (CW,
1:18).34
But the tattoo paralyzes gesture and silences the voice which also
belongs to the flesh. It represses the shout and the chance for a still
unorganized voice. And later, proposing the withdrawal of the theater from
text, prompter [souffleur], and the omnipotence of a primary logos,
Artaud will not simply wish to give it over to mutism. He will only
attempt the resituation and subordination of speech-the until now
enormous, pervasive, ubiquitous, bloated speech [parole soufflee]which had
exorbitantly weighed upon theatrical space. Without disappearing, speech
will now have to keep to its place; and to do so it will have to modify its
very function, will have no longer to be a language of words, of terms "in a
single defined sense" (TD, p. 118), of concepts which put an end to
thought and life. It is within the silence of definition-words that "we
could listen more closely to life" (ibid.). Thus, onomatopoeia, the
gesture dormant in all classical speech, will be reawakened, and along
with it sonority, intonation, intensity. And
the syntax governing the succession of word gestures will no longer be
a grammar of predication, a logic of "clear thinking" or of a knowing
consciousness. "When I say I will perform no written play, I mean that
I will perform no play based on writing and speech ... and that even
the spoken and written portions will be spoken and written in a new
sense" (TD, p. 111). "It is not a question of suppressing the spoken
language, but of giving words approximately the importance they have
in dreams" (TD, p. 94).35
Foreign to dance, as immobile and monumental as a definition,
materialized, that is to say, part of "clear thinking," the tattoo is thus

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

23

still all too silent. It maintains the silence of a liberated letter that speaks on
its own and assigns itself more importance than speech has in dreams.
The tatoo is a depository, a work, and it is precisely the work that must be
destroyed, as we now know. A fortiori the masterpiece: "no more
masterpieces" (the title of one of the most important texts of The Theater and
Its Double). Here again, to overthrow the power of the literal work is not to erase
the letter, but only to subordinate it to the incidence of illegibility or at
least of illiteracy. "I am writing for illiterates"36 As can be seen in certain
non-Western civilizations, precisely the ones that fascinated Artaud, illiteracy
can quite well accommodate the most profound and living culture. The
traces inscribed on the body will no longer be graphic incisions but wounds
received in the destruction of the West, its metaphysics and its theater, the
stigmata of this pitiless war. For the theater of cruelty is not a new theater
destined to escort some new novel that would modify from within an
unshaken tradition. Artaud undertakes neither a renewal, nor a critique,
nor a new interrogation of classical theater; he intends the effective,
active, and nontheoretical destruction of Western civilization and its
religions, the entirety of the philosophy which provides traditional theater
with its groundwork and decor beneath even its more apparently innovative
forms.
The stigmata and not the tattoo: thus, in the resume of what should
have been the first production of the theater of cruelty (The Conquest of
Mexico), incarnating the "question of colonization," and which "revives in a
brutal and implacable way the ever active fatuousness of Europe" (TD,
p.126), the stigmata are substituted for the text. "Out of this clash of moral
disorder and Catholic monarchy with pagan order, the subject can set off
unheard-of explosions of forces and images, sown here and there with
brutal dialogues. Men battling hand to hand, bearing within themselves,
like stigmata, the most opposed ideas" (TD, p.127).
The subversive efforts to which Artaud thus had always submitted the
imperialism of the letter had the negative meaning of a revolt for as long as
they took place within the milieu of literature as such. Thus, the initial works
surrounding the letters to Jacques Riviere. The revolutionary" affirmation
which was to receive a remarkable theoretical treatment in The Theater and its
Double nevertheless had surfaced in The Alfred Jarry Theater (1926-30). There
we already find prescribed a descent

2 38

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

toward the depth at which the distinction of theatrical organs (authortext /
director-actor-public), in the manifestation of forces, no longer would be
possible. Now this system of organic divisions, this difference, has never
been possible, except when distributed around an object, book, or
libretto. The depth sought after must thus be the depth of illegibility:
"Whatever is part of ... illegibility" "we want to see sparkle and
triumph on stage" (CW 2:23). In theatrical illegibility, in the night that
precedes the book, the sign has not yet been separated from force." It
is not quite yet a sign, in the sense in which we understand sign, but
is no longer a thing, which we conceive only as opposed to the sign. It
has, then, no chance to become, in this state, a written text or an
articulated speech; no chance to rise and to inflate itself above energeia
in order to be invested, according to Humboldt's distinction, with the
somber and objective impassivity of the ergon. Now Europe lives upon
the ideal of this separation between force and meaning as text, at the very
moment when, as we suggested above, in purportedly elevating the mind
above the letter, it states a preference for metaphorical writing. This
derivation of force within the sign divides the theatrical act, exiles the
actor far from any responsibility for meaning, makes of him an interpreter
who lets his life be breathed into [insoufe] him, and lets his words be
whispered [soufe] to him, receiving his delivery as if he were taking
orders, submitting like a beast to the pleasure of docility. Like the seated
public, he is but a consumer, an aesthete, a "pleasure-taker." The stage is no
longer cruel, is no longer
the stage, but a decoration, the luxurious illustration of a book. In the
best of cases, another literary genre. "Dialogue-a thing written and
spoken-does not belong specifically to the stage, it belongs to books,
as is proved by the fact that in all hand-books of literary history a place
is reserved for the theater as a subordinate branch of the history of the
spoken language" (TD, p. 37).
To let one's speech be spirited away [souffle] is, like writing itself, the
urphenomenon of the reserve: the abandoning of the self to the furtive, to
discretion and separation, is, at the same time, accumulation, capital
ization, the security of the delegated or deferred decision. To leave
one's speech to the furtive is to tranquilize oneself into deferral, that is to
say, into economy. The theater of the prompter [souffleur] thus con

structs the system of fear, and manages to keep fear at a distance with

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

239

the learned machinations of its materialized meditations. And, as we
know, Artaud, like Nietzsche, but through the theater, wants to return us to
Danger as Becoming. "The comtemporary theater is decadent because ...
it has broken away from ... Danger" (TD, p. 42), broken away from
Becoming: "It seems, in brief, that the highest possible idea of the theater is
one that reconciles us philosophically with Becoming" (TD, p. 109).
To reject the work, to let one's speech, body, and birth be spirited
away [souffle] by the furtive god is thus to defend oneself against the
theater of fear which multiplies the differences between myself and
myself Restored to its absolute and terrifying proximity, the stage of
cruelty will thus return me to the autarchic immediacy of my birth, my
body and my speech. Where has Artaud better defined the stage of
cruelty than in Here Lies, outside any apparent reference to the theater: "I,
Antonin Artaud, am my son / my father, my mother / and myself"
(AA, p. 238)?
But does not the theater which is no longer a colony succumb to its
own cruelty? Will it resist its own danger? Liberated from diction,
withdrawn from the dictatorship of the text, will not theatrical atheism be
given over to improvisational anarchy and to the actors' capricious
inspirations? Is not another form of subjugation in preparation? Another
flight of language into arbitrariness and irresponsibility? To thwart this
danger, which inwardly threatens danger itself, Artaud, through a strange
movement, disposes the language of cruelty within a new form of
writing: the most rigorous, authoritarian, regulated, and mathematicalthe most formal form of writing. This apparent incoherence suggests a
hasty objection. In truth, the will to maintain speech by defending oneself
against it governs, with its omnipotent and infallible logic, a reversal
that we will have to follow here.
To Jean Paulhan: "I do not believe that if you had once read my
Manifesto you could persevere in your objections, so either you have not
read it or you have read it badly. My plans have nothing to do with Copeau's
improvisations. However thoroughly they are immersed in the concrete
and external, however rooted in free nature and not in the narrow
chambers of the brain, they are not, for all that, left to the caprice of
the wild and thoughtless inspiration of the actor, especially

240

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

the actor who, once cut off from the text, plunges in without any idea of
what he is doing. I would not care to leave the fate of my plays and of the
theater to that kind of chance. No" (TD, pp. 109-10). "I give myself up to
feverish dreams, but I do so in order to deduce new laws. In delirium, I
seek multiplicity, subtlety and the eye of reason, not rash prophecies"
(CW 1:167).
If it is necessary, thus, to renounce "the theatrical superstition of the text
and the dictatorship of the writer" (TD, p. 124), it is because they could not
have imposed themselves without the aid of a certain model of speech and
writing: the speech that represents dear and willing thought, the
(alphabetic, or in any event phonetic) writing that represents
representative speech. Classical theater, the theater of diversions, was the
representation of all these representations. And this deferral, these delays,
these stages of representation extend and liberate the play of the signifier,
thus multiplying the places and moments of elusion. For the theater to be
neither subjected to this structure of language, nor abandoned to the
spontaneity of furtive inspiration, it will have to be governed according
to the requirements of another language and another form of writing. The
themes, but also occasionally the models, of writing doubtless will be
sought outside Europe, in Balinese theater, in the ancient Mexican, Hindu,
Iranian, Egyptian, etc., cosmogonies. This time, writing not only will
no longer be the transcription of speech, not only will be the writing of
the body itself, but it will be produced, within the movements of the
theater, according to the rules of hieroglyphics, a system of signs no longer
controlled by the institution of the voice. "The overlapping of images
and movements will
culminate, through the collusion of objects, silences, shouts, and
rhythms, or in a genuine physical language with signs, not words, as its
root" (TD, p. 287). Words themselves will once more become physical
signs that do not trespass toward concepts, but "will be construed in an
incantational, truly magical sense-for their shape and their sensuous
emanations" (TD, p. 125). Words will cease to flatten theatrical space
and to lay it out horizontally as did logical speech; they will reinstate
the "volume" of theatrical space and will utilize this volume "in its
undersides (dons ses dessous)" (TD, p. 124). It is not by chance, hence
forth, that Artaud speaks of "hieroglyphics" rather than ideograms:
"And it can be said that the spirit of the most ancient hieroglyphs will

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

241

preside at the creation of this pure theatrical language" (ibid.). (In
saying hieroglyphics, Artaud is thinking only of the principle of the
writing called hieroglyphic, which, as we know, did not in fact set aside all
phoneticism.)
Not only will the voice no longer give orders, but it will have to let
itself be punctuated by the law of this theatrical writing. The only way to
be done with the freedom of inspiration and with the spiriting away of
speech [la parole souf$ee] is to create an absolute mastery over breath
[le souffle] within a system of nonphonetic writing. Whence An Affective
Athleticism, the strange text in which Artaud seeks the laws of breath in the
Cabbala and in Yin and Yang, and wants "through the hieroglyph of a
breath ... to recover an idea of the sacred theater" (TD, p. 141). Having
always preferred the shout to the text, Artaud now attempts to elaborate
a rigorous textuality of shouts, a codified system of onomatopoeias,
expressions, and gestures-a veritable theatrical pasigraphy reaching
beyond empirical languages,39 a universal grammar of cruelty. "Similarly
the ten thousand and one expressions of the face caught in the form of
masks can be labeled and catalogued, so they may eventually participate
directly and symbolically in this concrete language of the stage" (TD, p.
94). Artaud even attempts to recognize, beneath their apparent
contingency, the necessity of unconscious formations; he therefore, after
a fashion, traces the form of theatrical writing from the model of
unconscious writing. This is perhaps the unconscious writing of which
Freud speaks in the "Note on the Mystic Writing Pad," as a writing which
erases and retains itself; although Freud speaks of this writing after having
warned, in The Interpretation of Dreams, against metaphorizing the
unconscious as an original text subsisting alongside the Umschrift
(transcription), and after having compared dreams, in a short text from 1913,
to "a system of writing" and even of "hieroglyphic" writing, rather than
to "a language."
Despite all appearance, that is, despite the entirety of Western metaphysics, this mathematizing formalization would liberate both the festival
and repressed ingenuity. "This may perhaps shock our European sense of
stage freedom and spontaneaous inspiration, but let no one say that this
mathematics creates sterility or uniformity. The marvel is that a sensation
of richness, of fantasy and prodigality emanates from this spectacle
ruled with a maddening scrupulosity and consciousness"

2 42

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

(TD, p. 55). "The actors with their costumes constitute veritable living,
moving hieroglyphs. And these three-dimensional hieroglyphs are in
turn brocaded with a certain number of gestures-mysterious signs
which correspond to some unknown, fabulous, and obscure reality
which we here in the Occident have completely repressed" (TD, p. 61).
How are this liberation and this raising of the repressed possible? And not
despite, but with the aid of a totalitarian codification and rhetoric of
forces? With the aid of cruelty, which initially signifies 'rigor" and
"submission to necessity" (TD, p. 102)? It is that by prohibiting chance
and by repressing the play of the machine, this new theatrical
arrangement sutures all the gaps, all the openings, all the differences.
Their origin and active movement-differing, deferralare enclosed. At this
point, eluded speech is definitively returned to us. And at this point, perhaps,
cruelty pacifies itself within its regained absolute proximity, within
another summary reduction of becoming, within the perfection and
economy of its return to the stage. "I, Antonin Artaud, am my son, /
my father, my mother, / and myself." Such is, according to Artaud's stated
desire, the law of the house, the initial organization of a dwelling space, the
ur-stage. The ur-stage is then present, reassembled into its presence, seen,
mastered, terrifying, and pacifying.
Furtive difference could not have insinuated itself with the aid of writing
but, rather, slipped in between two forms of writing, thereby placing my
life outside the work and making its origin-my flesh-into the epigraph
and breathless [essoufle] sarcophagous of my discourse. Only through
writing made flesh, only through the theatrical hieroglyphic, could the
necessary destruction of the double take place, and with it the erasure of
apo-cryphal writing which eludes my being as life, keeping me at a remove
from hidden force. Discourse can now be reunited with its birth in a
perfect and permanent self-presence. "It happens that this mannerism, this
excessively hieratic style, with its
rolling alphabet, its shrieks of splitting stones, noises of branches,
noises of the cutting and rolling of wood, compose a sort of animated
material murmur in the air, in space, a visual as well as audible whis
pering. And after an instant the magic identification is made: WE KNOW
IT IS WE WHO WERE SPEAKING" (TD, p. 67). The present knowledge of
the proper-past of our speech.

LA PAROLE SOUFFLEE

A magic identification, of course. The temporal differences would
sufficiently bear witness to this. And to say that it is magic is to say very
little. It could even be demonstrated that it is the very essence of magic. A
magic and, what is more, an unfindable identification. Unfindable is "the
grammar of this new language," which Artaud concedes "is still to be
found" (TD, p. 110). In fact, against all his intentions, Artaud had to
reintroduce the prerequisite of the written text into "productions" ...
"rigorously composed and fixed once and for all before being played"
(CEuvres completes [hereafter OC], 5:41). "All these groupings, researches,
and shocks will culminate nevertheless in a work written down, fixed in its
least details, and recorded by new means of notation. The composition, the
creation, instead of being made in the brain of an author, will be made in
nature itself, in real space, and the final result will be as strict and as
calculated as that of any written work whatsoever, with an immense
objective richness as well" (TD, pp. 11-112). Even if Artaud had not, as in fact he
did,40 had to respect the rights of the work and of the written work, does not
his very project (the reduction of the work and of difference, therefore of
historicity) indicate the very essence of madness? But this madness, as the
metaphysics of inalienable life and historic indifference-the "I speak /
from above time" (AA, p. 248)-no less legitimately has denounced, with
a gesture that does not give shelter to another metaphysics, the other madness,
as the metaphysics which lives within difference, within metaphor and the
work, and thus within alienation; and lives within them without conceiving them as such, beyond metaphysics. Madness is as much alienation
as inalienation. It is the work or the absence of the work." These two
determinations indefinitely confront one another within the closed field
of metaphysics, just as those whom Artaud calls evident or authentic
madmen confront the other madmen within history. They necessarily
confront one another and exchange themselves for each other; they
articulate themselves within the categories-acknowledged or not, but
always recognizable-of a single historico-metaphysical discourse. The
concepts of madness, alienation, or inalienation irreducibly belong to the
history of metaphysics. Or, more narrowly: they belong to the epoch of
metaphysics that determines Being as the life of a proper subjectivity. Now
difference-or deferral, with all the modifications laid bare by Artaud-can
only be conceived as such beyond

metaphysics, towards the Difference-or Duplicity-of which Heidegger
speaks. It could be thought that this latter Difference, which simultaneously
opens and conceals truth, and in fact distinguishes nothing-the
invisible accomplice of all speech-is furtive power itself, if this were
not to confuse the metaphysical and metaphorical category of the furtive
with that which makes it possible. If the "destruction"" of the history
of metaphysics, in the rigorous sense understood by Heidegger, is not a
simple surpassing of this history, one could then, sojourning in a place
which is neither within nor without this history, wonder about what links
the concept of madness to the concept of metaphysics in general: the
metaphysics which Artaud destroys and which he is still furiously
determined to construct or to preserve within the same movement of
destruction. Artaud keeps himself at the limit, and we have attempted to
read him at this limit. One entire side of his discourse destroys a tradition
which lives within difference, alienation, and negativity without seeing
their origin and necessity. To reawaken this tradition, Artaud, in sum,
recalls it to its own motifs: self-presence, unity, self-identity, the proper,
etc. In this sense, Artaud's "metaphysics," at its most critical moments,
fulfills the most profound and permanent ambition of western
metaphysics. But through another twist of his text, the most difficult one,
Artaud affirms the cruel (that is to say, in the sense in which he takes
this word, necessary) law of difference; a law that this time is raised to
the level of consciousness and is no longer experienced within
metaphysical naivete. This duplicity of Artaud's text, simultaneously more
and less than a stratagem, has unceasingly obliged us to pass over to the
other side of the limit, and thereby to demonstrate the closure of the
presence in which he had to enclose himself in order to denounce the
naive implications within difference. At this point, different things
ceaselessly and rapidly pass into each other, and the critical experience of
difference resembles the naive and metaphysical implications within difference, such
that to an inexpert scrutiny, we could appear to be criticizing Artaud's
metaphysics from the standpoint of metaphysics itself, when we are
actually delimiting a fatal complicity. Through this complicity is articulated
a necessary dependency of all destructive discourses: they
must inhabit the structures they demolish, and within them they must
shelter an indestructible desire for full presence, for nondifference:

simultaneously life and death. Such is the question that we have
attempted to pose, in the sense in which one poses a net, surrounding
the limit of an entire textual network, forcing the substitution of discourse, the detour made obligatory by sites, for the punctuality of the
position. Without the necessary duration and traces of this text, each
position immediately veers into its opposite. This too obeys a law. The
transgression of metaphysics through the "thought" which, Artaud tells
us, has not yet begun, always risks returning to metaphysics. Such is the
question in which we are posed. A question which is still and always enveloped
each time that speech, protected by the limits of a field, lets itself be
provoked from afar by the enigma of flesh which wanted properly to
be named Antonin Artaud.*

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING 247

FREUD AND THE SCENE
OF WRITING
This text is the fragment of a lecture given at the Institut de psychanalyse (Dr.
Green's seminar). At that time we were concerned with opening a debate
around certain propositions advanced in previous of my essays, notably,
Grammatology ("De la grammatologie," Critique 223-24).
Could these propositions-which here will remain present in the
background-have a place within the field of psychoanalytic questioning?
Regarding such a field, where were these propositions to be maintained, as
concerns their concepts and syntax?
The first part of the lecture touched upon this question in its greater
generality. The central concepts of this section were those of presence and of
archi-trace. We will indicate cursorily, by their general headings, the principal
stages of this first part.
1. Despite appearances, the deconstruction of logocentrism is not a
psychoanalysis of philosophy.
These appearances: the analysis of a historical repression and suppression of writing since Plato. This repression constitutes the origin of
philosophy as episteme, and of truth as the unity of logos and phone.
Repression, not forgetting; repression, not exclusion. Repression, as
Freud says, neither repels, nor flees, nor excludes an exterior force; it

contains an interior representation, laying out within itself a space of
repression. Here, that which represents a force in the form of the
writing interior to speech and essential to it has been contained outside
speech.
An unsuccessful repression, on the road to historical dismantling. It is
this dismantling that interests us, this unsuccessfulness which confers
upon its becoming a certain legibility and limits its historical
opaqueness. "Repressions that have failed will of course have more
claim on our interest than those that may have been successful; for the
latter will for the most part escape our examination" (Standard Edition of
the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, hereafter SE, XIV, 153).
The symptomatic form of the return of the repressed: the metaphor
of writing which haunts European discourse, and the systematic contradictions of the ontotheological exclusion of the trace. The repression of
writing as the repression of that which threatens presence and the
mastering of absence.
The enigma of presence "pure and simple": as duplication, original
repetition, auto-affection, and differance. The distinction between the
mastering of absence as speech and the mastering of absence as
writing. The writing within speech. Hallucination as speech and
hallucination as writing.
The relationship between phone and consciousness. The Freudian concept
of verbal representation as preconsciousness. Logophonocentrism is not a
philosophical or historical error which the history of philosophy, of the
West, that is, of the world, would have rushed into pathologically, but-is
rather a necessary, and necessarily finite, movement and structure: the
history of the possibility of symbolism in general (before the distinction
between man and animal, and even before the distinction between the
living and the nonliving); the history of differance, history as differance
which finds in philosophy as episteme, in the European form of the
metaphysical or onto
theological project, the privileged manifestation, with worldwide
dominance, of dissimulation, of general censorship of the text in
general.
2. An attempt to justify a theoretical reticence to utilize Freudian
concepts, otherwise than in quotation marks: all these concepts,

without exception, belong to the history of metaphysics, that is, to the
system of logocentric repression which was organized in order to
exclude or to lower (to put outside or below), the body of the written
trace as a didactic and technical metaphor, as servile matter or
excrement.
For example, logocentric repression is not comprehensible on the basis
of the Freudian concept of repression; on the contrary, logocentric
repression permits an understanding of how an original and individual
repression became possible within the horizon of a culture and a historical
structure of belonging.
Why it is a question neither of following Jung, nor of following the
Freudian concept of the hereditary mnemic trace. Certainly, Freudian
discourse-in its syntax, or, if you will, its labor-is not to be confused
with these necessarily metaphysical and traditional concepts. Certainly it
is not exhausted by belonging to them. Witness the precautions and the
"nominalism" with which Freud manipulates what he calls conventions
and conceptual hypotheses. And a conception of difference is attached
less to concepts than to discourse. But Freud never reflected upon the
historical and theoretical sense of these precautions.
The necessity of an immense labor of deconstruction of the metaphysical concepts and phrases that are condensed and sedimented
within Freud's precautions. The metaphysical complications of psychoanalysis and the so-called human (or social) sciences (the concepts of
presence, perception, reality, etc.). Linguistic phonologism.
The necessity of an explicit question concerning the meaning of
presence in general: a comparison of the undertakings of Heidegger and
of Freud. The epoch of presence, in the Heideggerian sense, and its central
support, from Descartes to Hegel: presence as consciousness, selfpresence conceived within the opposition of consciousness to
unconsciousness. The concepts of archi-trace and of difference: why they are
neither Freudian nor Heideggerian.
Difference, the pre-opening of the ontic-ontological difference (ef De la
grammatologie, p. 1029), and of all the differences which furrow Freudian
conceptuality, such that they may be organized, and this is only an
example, around the difference between "pleasure" and "reality," or
may be derived from this difference. The difference between the

pleasure principle and the reality principle, for example, is not
uniquely, nor primarily, a distinction, an exteriority, but rather the
original possibility, within life, of the detour, of deferral (Aufschub) and the
original possibility of the economy of death (cf Beyond the Pleasure Principle, SE
XVIII).
Difference and identity. Difference within the economy of the same. The
necessity of withdrawing the concepts of trace and of difference from all
classical conceptual oppositions. Necessity of the concept of archi-trace and
the erasure of the archia. This erasure, which maintains the legibility of the
archia, signifies a conceived relationship of belonging to the history of
metaphysics (De la grammetologie, 2:3 2).
In what ways would the Freudian concepts of writing and trace still be
threatened by metaphysics and positivism? The complicity of these two
menaces within Freud's discourse.

Worin die Bahnung sonst besteht bleibt
dahingestellt [In what pathbreaking
consists remains undetermined]. (Project fore
Scientific Psychology, 1895)
Our aim is limited: to locate in Freud's text several points of reference, and
to isolate, on the threshhold of a systematic examination, those elements
of psychoanalysis which can only uneasily be contained within
logocentric closure, as this closure limits not only the history of
philosophy but also the orientation of the "human sciences," notably of a
certain linguistics. If the Freudian break-through has an historical
originality, this originality is not due to its peaceful coexistence or
theoretical complicity with this linguistics, at least in its congenital
phonologism.'
It is no accident that Freud, at the decisive moments of his itinerary, has
recourse to metaphorical models which are borrowed not from spoken
language or from verbal forms, nor even from phonetic writing, but
from a script which is never subject to, never exterior and posterior to,
the spoken word. Freud invokes signs which do not transcribe living, full
speech, master of itself and self-present. In fact, and this will be our problem,
Freud does not simply use the metaphor of nonphonetic writing; he does not
deem it expedient to manipulate scriptural metaphors for didactic
ends. If such metaphors are

250

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

indispensable, it is perhaps because they illuminate, inversely, the
meaning of a trace in general, and eventually, in articulation with this
meaning, may illuminate the meaning of writing in the popular sense.
Freud, no doubt, is not manipulating metaphors, if to manipulate a
metaphor means to make of the known an allusion to the unknown. On
the contrary, through the insistence of his metaphoric investment he
makes what we believe we know under the name of writing enigmatic.
A movement unknown to classical philosophy is perhaps undertaken here,
somewhere between the implicit and the explicit. From Plato and
Aristotle on, scriptural images have regularly been used to illustrate the
relationship between reason and experience, perception and memory. But
a certain confidence has never stopped taking its assurance from the
meaning of the well-known and familiar term: writing. The gesture
sketched out by Freud interrupts that assurance and opens up a new kind
of question about metaphor, writing, and spacing in general.
We shall let our reading be guided by this metaphoric investment. It
will eventually invade the entirety of the psyche. Psychical content will
be represented by a text whose essence is irreducibly graphic. The structure of
the psychical apparatus will be represented by a writing machine. What
questions will these representations impose upon us? We shall not
have to ask if a writing apparatus-for example, the one described in
the "Note on the Mystic Writing Pad"-is a good metaphor for
representing the working of the psyche, but rather what apparatus we
must create in order to represent psychical writing; and we shall have
to ask what the imitation, projected and liberated in a machine, of
something like psychical writing might mean. And not if the psyche is
indeed a kind of text, but: what is a text, and what must the psyche be
if it can be represented by a text? For if there is neither machine nor
text without psychical origin, there is no domain of the psychic
without text. Finally, what must be the relationship between psyche,
writing, and spacing for such a metaphoric transition to be possible, not
only, nor primarily, within theoretical discourse, but within the history
of psyche, text, and
technology?

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING

25

Breaching and Difference
From the Project (1895) to the "Note on the Mystic Writing-Pad"
(1925), a strange progression: a problematic of breaching' is elaborated
only to conform increasingly to a metaphorics of the written trace. From a
system of traces functioning according to a model which Freud would have
preferred to be a natural one, and from which writing is entirely absent,
we proceed toward a configuration of traces which can no longer be
represented except by the structure and functioning of writing. At the
same time, the structural model of writing, which Freud invokes immediately
after the Project, will be persistently differentiated and refined in its
originality. All the mechanical models will be tested and abandoned, until
the discovery of the Wunderblock, a writing machine of marvelous
complexity into which the whole of the psychical apparatus will be
projected. The solution to all the previous difficulties will be presented in
the Wunderblock, and the "Note," indicative of an admirable tenacity, will
answer precisely the questions of the Project. The Wunderblock, in each of
its parts, will realize the apparatus of which Freud said, in the Project: "We
cannot off-hand imagine an apparatus capable of such complicated
functioning" (SE, I, 299), and which he replaced at that time with a
neurological fable whose framework and intention, in certain respects, he
will never abandon.
In 1895, the question was to explain memory in the manner of the
natural sciences, in order "to furnish a psychology that shall be a
natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes as quantitatively
determined states of specifiable material particles" (I, 295). Now, a "main
characteristic of nervous tissue is memory: that is, quite generally, a
capacity for being permanently altered by single occurrences" (I, 299).
And a "psychological theory deserving any consideration must furnish
an explanation of 'memory"' (ibid.). The crux of such an explanation, what
makes such an apparatus almost unimaginable, is the necessity of
accounting simultaneously, as the "Note" will do thirty years later, for the
permanence of the trace and for the virginity of the receiving substance, for
the engraving of furrows and for the perennially intact bareness of the
perceptive surface: in this case, of the neurones. "It would seem, therefore,
that neurones must be both influenced and also unaltered, unprejudiced
(unvoreingenommen)" (ibid.). Rejecting a

distinction, which was common in his day, between "sense cells" and
"memory cells," Freud then forges the hypothesis of "contactbarriers"
and "breaching" (Bahnung, lit. pathbreaking), of the breaking open of a path
(Bahn). Whatever may be thought of the continuities and ruptures to come,
this hypothesis is remarkable as soon as it is considered as a
metaphorical model and not as a neurological description. Breaching, the
tracing of a trail, opens up a conducting path. Which presupposes a
certain violence and a certain resistance to effraction. The path is broken,
cracked, fracta, breached. Now there would be two kinds of neurones: the
permeable neurones (0), which offer no resistance and thus retain no trace
of impression, would be the perceptual neurones; other neurones (pp),
which would oppose contact-barriers to the quantity of excitation, would
thus retain the printed trace: they "thus afford a possibility of
representing (darzustellen) memory" (ibid.). This is the first
representation, the first staging of memory. (Darstellung is representation in the
weak sense of the word, but also frequently in the sense of visual
depiction, and sometimes of theatrical performance. Our translation will
vary with the inflection of the context.) Freud attributes psychical quality
only to these latter neurones. They are the "vehicles of memory and so
probably of psychical processes in general" (I, 300). Memory, thus, is not
a psychical property among others; it is the very essence of the psyche:
resistance, and precisely, thereby, . an opening to the effraction of the
trace.
Now assuming that Freud here intends to speak only the language of full
and present quantity, assuming, as at least appears to be the case, that he
intends to situate his work within the simple opposition of quantity and
quality (the latter being reserved for the pure transparency of a
perception without memory), we find that the concept of breaching
shows itself intolerant of this intention. An equality of resistance to
breaching, or an equivalence of the breaching forces, would eliminate any
preference in the choice of itinerary. Memory would be paralyzed. It is the
difference between breaches which is the true origin of memory, and thus
of the psyche. Only this difference enables a "pathway to be preferred
(Wegbevorzugung)": "Memory is represented (dargestellt) by the differences
in the facilitations of the y,-neurones" (1, 300). We then must not say that
breaching without difference is insufficient for memory; it must be
stipulated that there is no pure

breaching without difference. Trace as memory is not a pure breaching that
might be reappropriated at any time as simple presence; it is rather the
ungraspable and invisible difference between breaches. We thus already
know that psychic life is neither the transparency of meaning nor the
opacity of force but the difference within the exertion of forces. As
Nietzsche had already said.'
That quantity becomes psyche and mneme through differences rather than
through plenitudes will be continuously confirmed in the Project itself.
Repetition adds no quantity of present force, no intensity; it reproduces the
same impression-yet it has the power of breaching. "The memory of
an experience (that is, its continuing operative power) depends on a
factor which is called the magnitude of the impression and on the
frequency with which the same impression is repeated" (I, 300). The
number of repetitions is thus added to the quantity (Q17) of the excitation,
and these two quantities are of two absolutely heterogeneous types.
There are only discrete repetitions, and they can act as such only through
the diastem which maintains their separation. Finally, if breaching can
supplement a quantity presently at work, or can be added to it, it is
because breaching is certainly analogous to quantity, but is other than it as
well: "quantity plus facilitation resulting from Qrf are at the same time
something that can replace Qr)" (I, 300-301). Let us not hasten to
define this other of pure quantity as quality: for in so doing we
would be transforming the force of memory into present consciousness
and the translucid perception of present qualities. Thus, neither the
difference between full quantities, nor the interval between repetitions
of the identical, nor breaching itself, may be thought of in terms of the
opposition between quantity and quality.' Memory cannot be derived
from this opposition, and it escapes the grasp of "naturalism" as well as
of "phenomenology."
All these differences in the production of the trace may be reinterpreted as moments of deferring. In accordance with a motif which will
continue to dominate Freud's thinking, this movement is described as the
effort of life to protect itself by deferring a dangerous cathexis, that is, by
constituting a reserve (Vorrat). The threatening expenditure or presence are
deferred with the help of breaching or repetition. Is this not already the
detour (Aufschub, lit. delay) which institutes the relation of pleasure to reality
(Beyond .......................................SE, XVIII)? Is it not already death at the

origin of a life which can defend itself against death only through an
economy of death, through deferment, repetition, reserve? For repetition
does not happen to an initial impression; its possibility is already there, in the
resistance offered the first time by the psychical neurones. Resistance itself is
possible only if the opposition of forces lasts and is repeated at the
beginning. It is the very idea of a first time which becomes enigmatic. What
we are advancing here does not seem to contradict what Freud will say
further on: "Facilitation is probably the result of the single (einmaliger)
passage of a large quantity." Even assuming that his affirmation does not lead
us little by little to the problem of phylogenesis and of hereditary breaches,
we may still maintain that in the first time of the contact between two forces,
repetition has begun. Life is already threatened by the origin of the
memory which constitutes it, and by the breaching which it resists, the
effraction which it can contain only by repeating it. It is because
breaching breaks open that Freud, in the Project, accords a privilege to
pain. In a certain sense, there is no breaching without a beginning of pain,
and "pain leaves behind it particularly rich breaches." But beyond a certain
quantity, pain, the threatening origin of the psyche, must be deferred,
like death, for it can ruin psychical "organization." Despite the
enigmas of the "first time" and of originary repetition (needless to say,
before any distinction between "normal" and "pathological" repetition),
it is important that Freud attributes all this work to the primary
function, and that he excludes any possible derivation of it. Let us
observe this nonderivation, even if it renders only more dense the
difficulty of the concepts of "primariness" and of the timelessness of the
primary process, and even if this difficulty does not cease to intensify in
what is to come. "Here we are almost involuntarily reminded of the
endeavor of the nervous system, maintained through every modification, to
avoid being burdened by a Qr/ or to keep the burden as small as possible.
Under the compulsion of the exigencies of life, the nervous system was
obliged to lay up a store of Qq. This necessitated an increase in the number
of its neurones, and these had to be impermeable. It now avoids, partly at least,
being filled with Qil (cathexis), by setting up facilitations. It will be seen, then,
that facilitation serve the primary function" (I, 301).
No doubt life protects itself by repetition, trace, differance (deferral). But we
must be wary of this formulation: there is no life present at first

which would then come to protect, postpone, or reserve itself in differance. The latter constitutes the essence of life. Or rather: as differance is not
an essence, as it is not anything, it is not life, if Being is determined as
ousia, presence, essence/existence, substance or subject. Life must be
thought of as trace before Being may be determined as presence. This is the
only condition on which we can say that life is death, that repetition and the
beyond of the pleasure principle are native and congenital to that which
they transgress. When Freud writes in the Project that "facilitations serve the
primary function," he is forbidding us to be surprised by Beyond the
Pleasure Principle. He complies with a dual necessity: that of recognizing
differance at the origin, and at the same time that of crossing out the concept
of primariness: we will not, then, be surprised by the Traumdeutung, which
defines primariness as a "theoretical fiction" in a paragraph on the "delaying"
(Versputung) of the secondary process. It is thus the delay which is in the
beginning.' Without which, differance would be the lapse which a
consciousness, a self-presence of the present, accords itself To defer
(differer) thus cannot mean to retard a present possibility, to postpone an act,
to put off a perception already now possible. That possibility is possible
only through a differance which must be conceived of in other terms than
those of a calculus or mechanics of decision.' To say that differance is
originary is simultaneously to erase the myth of a present origin. Which is
why "originary" must be understood as having been crossed out, without which
differance would be derived from an original plenitude. It is a non-origin
which is originary.
Rather than abandon it, we ought perhaps then to rethink the concept
of differer. This is what we should like to do, and this is possible only if
differance is determined outside any teleological or eschatological
horizon. Which is not easy. Let us note in passing that the concepts of
Nachtrdglichkeit and Verspatung, concepts which govern the whole of
Freud's thought and determine all his other concepts, are already present
and named in the Project. The irreducibility of the "effect of
deferral"-such, no doubt, is Freud's discovery. Freud exploits this
discovery in its ultimate consequences, beyond the psychoanalysis of the
individual, and he thought that the history of culture ought to confirm
it. In Moses and Monotheism (1937), the efficacy of delay and of action
subsequent to the event is at work over large historical intervals.

The problem of latency, moreover, is in highly significant contact with the
problem of oral and written tradition in this text.
Although "breaching" is not named writing at any time in the Project,
the contradictory requirements which the Mystic Writing Pad will fulfill are
already formulated in terms which are literally identical: "an unlimited
receptive capacity and a retention of permanent traces" (SE XIX,227).
Differences in the work of breaching concern not only forces but also
locations. And Freud already wants to think force and place simultaneously.' He is the first not to believe in the descriptive value of his
hypothetical representation of breaching. The distinction between the
categories of neurones "has no recognized foundation, at least insofar as
morphology (i.e., histology) is concerned." It is, rather, the index of a
topographical description which external space, that is, familiar and
constituted space, the exterior space of the natural sciences, cannot
contain. This is why, under the heading of "the biological standpoint," a
"difference in essence" (Wesensverschiedenheit) between the neurones is
"replaced by a difference in the environment to which they are destined"
(Schicksals-Milieuverschiedenheit) (I, 304): these are pure differences,
differences of situation, of connection, of localization, of structural
relations more important than their supporting terms; and they are
differences for which the relativity of outside and inside is always to be
determined. The thinking of difference can neither dispense with topography nor accept the current models of spacing.
This difficulty becomes more acute when it becomes necessary to
explain those differences that are pure par excellence: differences of
quality, that is, for Freud, differences of consciousness. He must provide
an explanation for "what we are aware of, in the most puzzling fashion
(rutselhaft), through our 'consciousness' " (I, 307). And "since this
consciousness knows nothing of what we have so far been assumingquantities and neurones-it [the theory] should explain this lack of
knowledge to us as well" (I, 308). Now qualities are clearly pure
differences: "Consciousness gives us what are called qualitiessensations
which are diferent (antlers) and whose difference (Anders, lit. otherness) is
distinguished (unterschieden wird, lit. is differentiated) according to its
relations with the external world. Within this difference there are
series, similarities, and so on, but there are in fact no

quant ties in it. It may be asked how qualities originate and where qualities
originate" (1, 308).
Neither outside nor inside. They cannot be in the external world,
where the physicist recognizes only quantities, "masses in motion and
nothing else" (I, 308). Nor in the interiority of the psyche (i.e., of
memory), for "reproducing or remembering" are "without quality
(qualitatslos)" (ibid,). Since rejection of the topographical model is out of the
question, "we must summon up courage to assume that there is a third
system of neurones perhaps [perceptual neurones-which is excited
along with perception, but not along with reproduction, and whose states
of excitation give rise to the various qualities-are, that is to say, conscious
sensations" (I, 309). Foreshadowing the interpolated sheet of the mystic writingpad, Freud, annoyed by this "jargon," tells Fliess (letter 39, 1 Jan. 1896)
that he is inserting, "slipping" (schieben) the perceptual neurones (w)
between the 0-- and V/-neurones.
This last bit of daring results in "what seems like an immense difficulty": we have just encountered a permeability and a breaching
which proceed from no quantity at all. From what then? From pure
time, from pure temporalization in its conjunction with spacing: from
periodicity. Only recourse to temporality and to a discontinuous or
periodic temporality will allow the difficulty to be resolved, and we must
patiently consider its implications. "I can see only one way out.... So
far I have regarded it [the passage of quantity] only as the transference of
Qq from one neurone to another. It must have another characteristic, of a
temporal nature" (I, 310).
If the discontinuity hypothesis "goes further," Freud emphasizes, than
the "physical clarification" due to its insistence on periods, it is because
in this case differences, intervals, and discontinuity are registered,
"appropriated" without their quantitative support. Perceptual neurones,
incapable of receiving Qq [quantities], appropriate the period of the
excitation" (ibid.). Pure difference, again, and difference between
diastems. The concept of a period in general precedes and conditions the
opposition between quantity and quality, and everything governed by
this opposition. For "w-neurones too have their period, of course; but it is
without quality, or more correctly, monotonous" (ibid.). As we shall
see, this insistence on discontinuity will faithfully become the occupation
of the "Note on the Mystic Writing Pad": as

258

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

in the Project, it will be a last bold move resolving a final logical
difficulty.
The rest of the Project will depend in its entirety upon an incessant
and increasingly radical invocation of the principle of difference.
Beneath an indicial neurology, which plays the representational role of an
aritficial model, we repeatedly find a persistent attempt to account for
the psyche in terms of spacing, a topography of traces, a map of
breaches; and we repeatedly find an attempt to locate consciousness or
quality in a space whose structure and possibility must be rethought,
along with an attempt to describe the "functioning of the apparatus" in
terms of pure differences and locations, an attempt to explain how
"quantity of excitation is expressed in t/i by complexity and quality by
topography." It is because the nature of this system of differences and of
this topography is radically new and must not allow any omissions that
Freud, in his setting up of the apparatus, multiplies "acts of boldness,"
"strange but indispensable hypotheses" (concerning "secreting"
neurones or "key" neurones). And when he renounces neurology and
anatomical localizations, it will be not in order to abandon his
topographical preoccupations, but to transform them. Trace will
become gramme; and the region of breaching a ciphered spacing.
The Print and the Original Supplement

A few weeks after the Project is sent to Fliess, during a "night of work," all the
elements of the system arrange themselves into a "machine." It is not yet
a writing machine: "Everything fell into place, the cogs meshed, the
thing really seemed to be a machine which in a moment would run of
itself" 8 In a moment: in thirty years. By itself: almost.
A little more than a year later, the trace starts to become writing. In
letter 52 (6 Dec. 1896), the entire system of the Project is reconstituted in
terms of a graphic conception as yet unknown in Freud. It is not
surprising that this coincides with the transition from the neurological to
the psychical. At the heart of the letter: the words "sign" (Zeichen),
registration (Niederschrift), transcription (Umschrift). Not only is the
communication between trace and delay (i.e., a present which does not
constitute but is originally reconstituted from "signs" of memory)
explicitly defined in this letter, but verbal phenomena are assigned a

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING 25!

place within a system of stratified writing which these phenomena are far
from dominating: "As you know, I am working on the assumption that
our psychic mechanism has come into being by a process of
stratification (Aufeinanderschichtung); the material present in the form of
memory-traces (Errinerungsspuren) being subjected from time to time to a
rearrangement (Umordnung) in accordance with fresh circumstances to a
retranscription (Umschrift). Thus, what is essentially new about my theory is
the thesis that memory is present not once but several times over, that it is
laid down (niederlegt) in various species of indications [Zeichen, lit. signs] ....I
cannot say how many of these registrations (Niederschriften) there are: at
least three, probably more .... The different registrations are also separated
(not necessarily topographically) according to the neurones which are
their vehicles .... Perception. These are neurones in which perceptions
originate, to which consciousness attaches, but which in themselves retain
no trace of what has happened. For consciousness and memory are mutually
exclusive. Indication of perception: the first registration of the perceptions; it is
quite incapable of consciousness and arranged according to associations
by simultaneity ....Unconscious is a second registration .... Preconscious is
the third transcription, attached to word-presentations and corresponding to
our official ego .... This secondary thought-consciousness is subsequent in time
and probably linked to the hallucinatory activation of word-presentations"
(I, 235).
This is the first move toward the "Note." From now on, starting
with the Traumdeutung (1900), the metaphor of writing will appropriate
simultaneously the problems of the psychic apparatus in its structure and that of the
psychic text in its fabric. The solidarity of the two problems should make us that
much more attentive: the two series of metaphors-text and
machine--do not come on stage at the same time.
"Dreams generally follow old facilitations," said the Project. Topographical, temporal, and formal regression in dreams must thus be
interpreted, henceforth, as a path back into a landscape of writing. Not
a writing which simply transcribes, a stony echo of muted words, but a
lithography before words: metaphonetic, nonlinguistic, alogical. (Logic
obeys consciousness, or preconsciousness, the site of verbal images, as
well as the principle of identity, the founding expression of a philosophy
of presence. "It was only a logical contradiction, which does not have
much import," we read in The Wolf-Man.) With dreams

displaced into a forest of script, the Traumdeutung, the interpretation of
dreams, no doubt, on the first approach will be an act of reading and
decoding. Before the analysis of the Irma dream, Freud engages in
considerations of method. In one of his familiar gestures, he opposes the
old popular tradition to so-called scientific psychology. As always, it is in
order to justify the profound intention which inspires the former.
Popular tradition may err, of course, when according to a "symbolical"
procedure, it treats dream content as an indivisible and unarticulated

(Chiffriermethode), since it treats dreams as a kind of cryptography
(Geheimschrift) in which each sign can be translated into another sign
having a known meaning, in accordance with a fixed key (Schlussel)" (IV, 97).
Let us retain the allusion to a permanent code: it is the weakness of a
method to which Freud attributes, nevertheless, the merit of being
analytic and of spelling out the elements of meaning one by one.
A strange example, the one chosen by Freud to illustrate this traditional procedure: a text of phonetic writing is cathected and functions as
a discrete, specific, translatable and unprivileged element in the overall
writing of the dream. Phonetic writing as writing within writing.
Assume, for example, says Freud, that I have dreamed of a letter (Brief /
epistola), then of a burial. Open a Traumbuch, a book in which the keys to
dreams are recorded, an encyclopedia of dream signs, the dream
dictionary which Freud will soon reject. It teaches us that letter must be
translated (fbersetzen) by spite, and burial by engagement to be married. Thus
a letter (epistola) written with letters (litterae), a document composed of
phonetic signs, the transcription of verbal discourse, may be translated by

wrongly it is of no concern to us here) various structures (hieroglyphics
strictly speaking or symbolical ones, each type being either curiological
or tropological, the relation here being of analogy or of part to whole)
which ought to be systematically confronted with the mechanisms of dreamwork (condensation, displacement, overdetermination). Now Warburton,
interested, for reasons of self-justification, in demonstrating, against Father
Kircher, "the high antiquity of Egyptian learning," chooses the example of
an Egyptian science which draws all its resources from hieroglyphic writing.
That science is Traumdeutung, also known as oneirocriticism. When all is
said and done, it was only a science of writing in priestly hands. God,
the Egyptians believed, had made man a gift of writing just as he inspired
dreams. Interpreters, like dreams themselves, then had only to draw
upon the curiological or tropological storehouse. They would readily
find there the key to dreams, which they would then pretend to
divine. The hieroglyphic code itself served as a Traumbuch. An alleged
gift of God, in fact constructed historically, it had become the common
source from which was drawn oneiric discourse: the setting and the
text of the dream's mice en scene. Since dreams are constructed like a form

that age do? They consulted writing itself:

phonetic transcription is bound, far from the center, in a web of silent
script.

It will be said: and yet Freud translates all the time. He believes in the
generality and the fixity of a specific code for dream writing: "When
we have become familiar with the abundant use made by symbolism
for representing sexual material in dreams, the question is bound to
arise of whether many of these symbols do not occur with a permanently fixed meaning, like the 'grammalogues' in short; and we shall feel
tempted to draw up a new 'dream-book' on the decoding principle"
(V.351). And, in fact, Freud never stopped proposing codes, rules of
great generality. And the substitution of signifiers seems to be the
essential activity of psychoanalytic interpretation. Certainly, Freud
nevertheless stipulates an essential limitation on this activity. Or, rather, a
double limitation.
If we consider first verbal expression, as it is circumscribed in the
dream, we observe that its sonority, the materiality of the expression,
does not disappear before the signified, or at least cannot be traversed and
transgressed as it is in conscious speech. It acts as such, with the
efficacy Artaud assigned it on the stage of cruelty."The materiality of a
word cannot be translated or carried over into another language.
Materiality is precisely that which translation relinquishes. To relinquish
materiality: such is the driving force of translation. And when that
materiality is reinstated, translation becomes poetry. In this sense, since
the materiality of the signifier constitutes the idiom of every dream
scene, dreams are untranslatable: "Indeed, dreams are so closely related to
linguistic expression that Ferenczi has truly remarked that every tongue
has its own dream language. It is impossible as a rule to translate a dream
into a foreign language, and this is equally true, I fancy, of a book such
as the present one" (IV, 99, n. I ). What is valid for a specific national
language is a fortiori valid for a private grammar.
Moreover, this horizontal impossibility of translation without loss has
its basis in a vertical impossibility. We are speaking here of the way in which
unconscious thoughts become conscious. If a dream cannot be translated
into another language, it is because within the psychical apparatus as well
there is never a relation of simple translation. We are wrong, Freud tells
us, to speak of translation or transcription in describing the transition
of unconscious thoughts through the preconscious toward consciousness.
Here again the metaphorical concept of translation (Ubersetzung) or
transcription (Umschrift) is dangerous, not

because it refers to writing, but because it presupposes a text which
would be already there, immobile: the serene presence of a statue, of a
written stone or archive whose signified content might be harmlessly
transported into the milieu of a different language, that of the preconscious or the conscious. It is thus not enough to speak of writing in
order to be faithful to Freud, for it is then that we may betray him more
than ever.
This is what the last chapter of the Traumdeutung explains. An entirely and
conventionally topographical metaphor of the psychical apparatus is to be
completed by invoking the existence of force and of two kinds of
processes of excitation or modes of its discharge: "So let us try to
correct some conceptions [intuitive illustrations: Anschauungen] which might
be misleading so long as we looked upon the two systems in the most
literal and crudest sense as two localities in the mental apparatusconceptions which left their traces in the expressions 'to repress' and
'to force a way through.' Thus, we may speak of an unconscious
thought seeking to convey itself into the preconscious so as to be able then
to force its way through into consciousness. What we have in mind here is
not the forming of a second thought situated in a new place, like a
transcription (Umschrift) which continues to exist alongside the
original; and the notion of forcing a way through into consciousness
must be kept carefully free from any idea of a change of locality" (V, 610).
"
Let us interrupt our quotation for a moment. The conscious text is
thus not a transcription, because there is no text present elsewhere as an
unconscious one to be transposed or transported. For the value of
presence can also dangerously affect the concept of the unconscious.
There is then no unconscious truth to be rediscovered by virtue of
having been written elsewhere. There is no text written and present
elsewhere which would then be subjected, without being changed in the
process, to an operation and a temporalization (the latter belonging to
consciousness if we follow Freud literally) which would be external to it,
floating on its surface. There is no present text in general, and there is
not even a past present text, a text which is past as having been present. The
text is not conceivable in an originary or modified form of presence. The
unconscious text is already a weave of pure traces, differences in which
meaning and force are united-a text nowhere present,

ies of a meaning which was never present, whose signified presence is
always reconstituted by deferral, nachtrtiglich, belatedly, supplementarily: for the
nachtraglich also means supplementary. The call of the supplement, is primary,
here, and it hollows out that which will be reconstituted by deferral as
the present. The supplement, which seems to be added as a plenitude to a
plenitude, is equally that which compensates for a lack (qui supplee).
"Suppleer: 1. To add what is missing, to supply a necessary surplus," says
Littre, respecting, like a sleepwalker, the strange logic of that word. It is
within its logic that the possibility of deferred action should be
conceived, as well as, no doubt, the relationship between the primary and
the secondary on all levels." Let us note:Nachtrag has a precise meaning
in the realm of letters: appendix, codicil, postscript. The text we call
present may be deciphered only at the bottom of the
page, in a footnote or postscript. Before the recurrence, the present is
only the call for a footnote." That the present in general is not primal
but, rather, reconstituted, that it is not the absolute, wholly living form
which constitutes experience, that there is no purity of the living
formidable for metaphysics, which Freud,

present-such is the theme, in a conceptual scheme unequal to the thing
itself, would have us
pursue. This pursuit is doubtless the only one which is exhausted
neither w Since the transition to consciousness is not a derivative or
repetitive writing, a transcription duplicating an unconscious writing, it
occurs in an original manner and, in its very secondariness, is originary
and irreducible. Since consciousness for Freud is a surface exposed to the
external world, it is here that instead of reading through the metaphor in
the usual sense, we must, on the contrary, understand the possibility of a
writing advanced as conscious and as acting in the world (the visible
exterior of the graphism, of the literal, of the literal becoming literary,
etc.) in terms of the labor of the writing which circulated like
psychical energy between the unconscious and the conscious. The
"objectivist" or "worldly" consideration of writing teaches us nothing
is not made to a space of psychical writing- (We might say:

of transcendental writing in the event that, would see the psyche as a
region of the world. But since this is also the'

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING

26

case for Freud, who wants to respect simultaneously the Being-in-theworld of the psyche, its Being-situated, and the originality of its topology, which is irreducible to any ordinary intraworldliness, we perhaps
should think that what we are describing here as the labor of writing
erases the transcendental distinction between the origin of the world and
Being-in-the-world. Erases it while producing it: the medium of the
dialogue and misunderstanding between the Husserlian and Heideggerian
concepts of Being-in- the-world.)
Concerning this nontranscriptive writing, Freud adds a fundamental
specification. This specification will reveal: (1) the danger involved in
immobilizing or freezing energy within a naive metaphorics of place; (2)
the necessity not of abandoning but of rethinking the space or topology
of this writing; (3) that Freud, who still insists on representing the psychical
apparatus in an artificial model, has not yet discovered a mechanical model
adequate to the graphematic conceptual scheme he is already using to
describe the psychical text.
Again, we may speak of a preconscious thought being repressed or driven
out and then taken over by the unconscious. These images, derived from a set
of ideas (Vorstellungskreis) relating to a struggle for a piece of ground, may
tempt us to suppose that it is literally true that a mental grouping (Anordnung)
in one locality has been brought to an end and replaced by a fresh one in
another locality. Let us replace these metaphors by something that seems to
correspond better to the real state of affairs, and let us say that some
particular mental grouping has had a cathexis of energy (Energiebesetzung)
attached to it or withdrawn from it, so that the structure in question has
come under the sway of a particular agency or been withdrawn from it. What
we are doing here is once again to replace a topographical way of
representing things by a dynamic one. What we regard as mobile (dos
Bewegliche) is not the psychical structure itself but its innervation [V, 61o-6ii].
Let us once more interrupt our quotation. The metaphor of translation as
the transcription of an original text would separate force and extension,
maintaining the simple exteriority of the translated and the translating.
This very exteriority, the static and topological bias of the metaphor, would
assure the transparency of a neutral translation, of a

2 68

W RIT IN G AND DIFFERENCE

phoronomic and nonmetabolic process. Freud emphasizes this: psychic
writing does not lend itself to translation because it is a single energetic
system (however differentiated it may be), and because it covers the
entirety of the psychical apparatus. Despite the difference of agencies,
psychical writing in general is not a displacement of meanings within the
limpidity of an immobile, pregiven space and the blank neutrality of
discourse. A discourse which might be coded without ceasing to be
diaphanous. Here energy cannot be reduced; it does not limit meaning, but
rather produces it. The distinction between force and meaning is
derivative in relation to an archi-trace; it belongs to the metaphysics of
consciousness and of presence, or rather of presence in the word, in the
hallucination of a language determined on the basis of the word or of
verbal representation. The metaphysics of preconsciousness, Freud might
say, since the preconscious is the place he assigns to the verbal. Without
that, would Freud have taught us anything new?
Force produces meaning (and space) through the power of "repetition"
alone, which inhabits it originarily as its death. This power, that is, this lack
of power, which opens and limits the labor of force, institutes
translatability, makes possible what we call "language," transforms an
absolute idiom into a limit which is always already transgressed: a pure
idiom is not language; it becomes so only through repetition; repetition
always already divides the point of departure of the first time. Despite
appearances, this does not contradict what we said earlier about
untranslatability. At that time it was a question of recalling the origin of the
movement of transgression, the origin of repetition, and the becominglanguage of the idiom. If one limits oneself to the datum or the effect of repetition,
to translation, to the obviousness of the distinction between
force and meaning, not only does one miss the originality of Freud's
aim, but one effaces the intensity of the relation to death as well.
We ought thus to examine closely-which we cannot do here-all
that Freud invites to think concerning writing as "breaching" in the
psychical repetition of this previously neurological notion: opening up of its
own space, effraction, breaking of a path against resistances, rupture
and irruption becoming a route (rupta, via rupta), violent inscription of a
form, tracing of a difference in a nature or a matter which are conceiv
able as such only in their opposition to writing. The route is opened in
nature or matter, forest or wood (hyle), and in it acquires a reversibility

of time and space. We should have to study together, genetically and
structurally, the history of the road and the history of writing." We are
thinking here of Freud's texts on the work of the memory-trace (Erin
nerungsspur) which, though no longer the neurological trace, is not yet
"conscious memory," ("The Unconscious," SE XIV, 188), and of the
itinerant work of the trace, producing and following its route, the trace
which traces, the trace which breaks open its own path. The metaphor of
pathbreaking, so frequently used in Freud's descriptions, is always in
communication with the theme of the supplementary delay and with the
reconstitution of meaning through deferral, after a mole-like progression,
after the subterranean toil of an impression. This impression has left
behind a laborious trace which has never been perceived, whose meaning
has never been lived in the present, i.e., has never been lived consciously.
The postscript which constitutes the past present as such is not satisfied, as
Plato, Hegel, and Proust perhaps thought, with reawakening or
revealing the present past in its truth. It produces the present past. Is
sexual deferral the best example or the essence of this movement? A false
question, no doubt: the (presumably known) subject of the questionsexuality-is determined, limited, or unlimited only through inversion
and through the answer itself Freud's answer, in any event, is decisive. Take
the Wolf-Man. It is by deferral that the perception of the primal scenewhether it be reality or fantasy hardly matters-is lived in its meaning,
and sexual maturation is not the accidental form of this delay. "At
age one and a half, he received impressions the deferred understanding
of which became possible for him at the time of the dream through his
development, exaltation and sexual investigations." Already in the Project,
concerning repression in hysteria: "We invariably find that a memory is
repressed which has become a trauma only after the event (nur nachtrdglich).
The reason for this state of things is the retardation (Verspdtung) of puberty as
compared with the remainder of the individual's development." That
should
lead, if not to the solution, at least to a new way of posing the formid
able problem of the temporalization and the so-called "timelessness"
of the unconscious. Here, more than elsewhere, the gap between
Freud's intuition and his concepts is apparent. The timelessness of the
unconscious is no doubt determined only in opposition to a common
concept of time, a traditional concept, the metaphysical concept: the

270

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

time of mechanics or the time of consciousness. We ought perhaps to
read Freud the way Heidegger read Kant: like the cogito, the
unconscious is no doubt timeless only from the standpoint of a certain
vulgar conception of time."
Dioptrics and Hieroglyphics
Let us not hasten to conclude that by invoking an energetics, as
opposed to a topography, of translation Freud abandoned his efforts at
localization. If, as we shall see, he persists in giving a projective and
spatial-indeed, purely mechanical-representation of energetic pro
cesses, it is not simply for didactic reasons: a certain spatiality, inseparable
from the very idea of system, is irreducible; its nature is all the more
enigmatic in that we can no longer consider it as the homogeneous
and serene milieu of dynamic and economic processes. In the
Traumdeutung, the metaphoric machine is not yet adapted to the scriptural
analogy which already governs-as shall soon be clear-Freud's entire
descriptive presentation. It is an optical machine.
Let us return to our quotation. Freud does not want to abandon the
topographical model against which he has just warned us: "Nevertheless,
I consider it expedient and justifiable to continue to make use of the
figurative image (anschauliche Vorstellung: intuitive representation, metaphor) of
the two systems. We can avoid any possible abuse of this method of
representation (mode de mise en scene; Darstellungsweise) by recollecting that ideas
(Vorstellungen: representations), thoughts and psychical structures in general
must never be regarded as localized in organic elements of the nervous
system but rather, as one might say, between them, where resistance and
facilitations provide the corresponding correlates. Everything that can be
an object (Gegenstand) of our internal
perception is virtual, like the image produced in a telescope by the
passage of light rays. But we are justified in assuming the existence of the
systems (which are not in any way psychical entities themselves [my italics] and can
never be accessible to our psychical perception) like the lenses of the
telescope, which cast the image. And, if we pursue this analogy, we
compare the censorship between two systems to the refraction [the
breaking of the ray: Strahlenbrechung] which takes place when a ray of
light passes into a new medium" (V, 611)

This representation already cannot be understood in terms of the
spatiality of a simple, homogenous structure. The change in medium
and the movement of refraction indicate this sufficiently. Later, in a
further reference to the same machine, Freud proposes an interesting
differentiation. In the same chapter, in the section on "Regression," he
attempts to explain the relation between memory and perception in the
memory trace.
What is presented to us in these words is the idea of

are here concerned is also known to us in the form of an anatom
ical preparation laboratory preparation], and I shall carefully
avoid the temptation to determine psychical locality in any anatomical
fashion. I shall remain upon psychological ground, and I propose simply to
follow the suggestion that we should picture the instrument which carries
out our mental functions as resembling a compound microscope, or a
photographic apparatus, or something of the kind. On that basis, psychical
locality will correspond to a place (Ort) inside the apparatus at which one of
the preliminary stages of an image comes into being. In the microscope and
telescope, as we know, these occur in part at ideal points, regions in which
no tangible component of the apparatus is situated. I see no necessity to
apologize for the imperfections of this or of any similar imagery N 536].
psychical locality. I

[Preparat:

Beyond its pedagogical value, this illustration proves useful for its distinction between system and psyche: the psychical system is not psychical, and
in this description only the system is in question. Next, it is the
operation of the apparatus which interests Freud, how it runs and in
what order, the regulated timing of its movements as it is caught and
localized in the parts of the mechanism: "Strictly speaking, there is no
need for the hypothesis that the psychical systems are actually arranged in
a spatial order. It would be sufficient if a fixed order were established by the
fact that in a given psychical process the excitation passes through the systems
in a particular temporal sequence" (V, 537). Finally, these optical instruments
capture light; in the example of photography they register it." Freud wants
to account for the photographic negative or inscription of light, and this is
the differentiation (Differenzierung) which

272

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

he introduces. It will reduce the "imperfections" of his analogy and
perhaps "excuse" them. Above all it will throw into relief the apparently
contradictory requirement which has haunted Freud since the Project and
will be satisfied only by a writing machine, the "Mystic Pad":
Next, we have grounds for introducing a first differentiation at the sensory
end [of the apparatus]. A trace (Spur) is left in our psychical apparatus of
the perceptions which impinge upon it. This we may describe as a
"memory-trace" (Errinerungsspur); and to the function relating to it we
give the name of "memory." If we are in earnest over our plan of
attaching psychical processes to systems, memory-traces can only
consist in permanent modifications of the elements of the systems. But, as
has already been pointed out elsewhere, there are obvious difficulties
involved in supposing that one and the same system can accurately retain
modifications of its elements and yet remain perpetually open to the
reception of fresh occasions for modification
N, 538].
Two systems will thus be necessary in a single machine. This double
system, combining freshness of surface and depth of retention, could
only distantly and "imperfectly" be represented by an optical machine. "By
analysing dreams we can take a step forward in our understanding of the
composition of that most marvelous and most mysterious of all
instruments. Only a small step no doubt; but a beginning." Thus do we
read in the final pages of the Traumdeutung (V, 608). Only a small step. The
graphic representation of the (nonpsychical) system of the psychical is
not yet ready at a time when such a representation of the psychical has
already occupied, in the Traumdeutung itself, a large area. Let us measure this
delay.
We have already defined elsewhere the fundamental property of
writing, in a difficult sense of the word, as spacing: diastem and time
becoming space; an unfolding as well, on an original site, of meanings
which irreversible, linear consecution, moving from present point to
present point, could only tend to repress, and (to a certain extent)
could only fail to repress. In particular in so-called phonetic writing.
The latter's complicity with logos (or the time of logic), which is
dominated by the principle of noncontradiction, the cornerstone of all

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING

273

metaphysics or presence, is profound. Now in every silent or not
wholly phonic spacing out of meaning, concatenations are possible
which no longer obey the linearity of logical time, the time of consciousness or preconsciousness, the time of "verbal representations."
The border between the non-phonetic space of writing (even "phonetic" writing) and the space of the stage (scene) of dreams is uncertain.
We should not be surprised then, if Freud, in order to suggest the
strangeness of the logico-temporal relations in dreams, constantly
adduces writing, and the spatial synopses of pictograms, rebuses,
hieroglyphics and nonphonetic writing in general. Synopsis and not
stasis: scene and not tableau. The laconic, lapidary quality of dreams is
not the impassive presence of petrified signs."
Interpretation has spelled out the elements of dreams. It has revealed
the work of condensation and displacement. It is still necessary to
account for the synthesis which composes and stages the whole. The
resources of the mise en scene (die Darstellungsmittel) must be questioned. A
certain polycentrism of dream representation is irreconcilable with the
apparently linear unfolding of pure verbal representations. The logical
and ideal structure of conscious speech must thus submit to the dream
system and become subordinate to it, like a part of its machinery.
The different portions of this complicated structure stand, of course, in
the most manifold logical relations to one another. They can represent
foreground and background, digressions and illustrations, conditions,
chains of evidence and counter-arguments. When the whole mass of these
dream-thoughts is brought under the pressure of the dream-work, and its
elements are turned about, broken into fragments and jammed togetheralmost like pack-ice-the question arises of what happens to the logical
connections which have hitherto formed its framework. What
representation (mise en scene) do dreams provide for "if," "because," "just
as," "although," "either-or," and all the other conjunctions without which
we cannot understand sentences or speeches?" [V, 312].
This type of representation (mise en scene) may at first be compared to
those forms of expression which are like the writing within speech: the

274

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

painting or sculpture of signifiers which inscribe in a common space
elements which the spoken chain must suppress. Freud sets them off
against poetry, "which can make use of speech (Rede)." But may the
dream as well not use spoken language? "In dreams we see but we do not
hear," said the Project. In point of fact, Freud, like Artaud later on, meant less
the absence than the subordination of speech on the dreamstage."' Far from
disappearing, speech then changes purpose and status. It is situated,
surrounded, invested (in all senses of the word),' constituted. It figures in
dreams much as captions do in comic strips, those picto-hieroglyphic
combinations in which the phonetic text is secondary and not central in
the telling of the tale: "Before painting became acquainted with the laws
of expression by which it is governed ... in ancient paintings small labels
were hung from the mouths of the persons represented, containing in
written characters (als Schrift) the speeches which the artist despaired of
representing pictorially" [V,
312].
The overall writing of dreams exceeds phonetic writing and puts
speech back in its place. As in hieroglyphics or rebuses, voice is circumvented. From the very beginning of the chapter on "The DreamWork," we are left in no doubt on this subject, although Freud still uses the
concept of translation on which he will later cast suspicion. "The dreamthoughts and the dream-content (the latent and manifest) are presented to us
like two versions (mises en scene) of the same subjectmatter in two different
languages. Or, more properly, the dreamcontent seems like a transcript
(Ubertragung) of the dream-thoughts into another mode of expression,
whose characters and syntactic laws it is our business to discover by
comparing the original and the translation. The dream-thoughts are
immediately comprehensible, as soon as we have learnt them. The
dream-content, on the other hand, is expressed as it were in a pictographic
script (Bilderschrift), the characters of which have to be transposed
individually into the language of the dreamthoughts" (IV, 277).
Bilderschrift: not an inscribed image but a figurative script, an image inviting
not a simple, conscious, present perception of the thing itself-assuming it
exists-but a reading. "If we attempted to read these characters according to
their symbolic relation (Zeichenbeziehung), we should clearly be led into
error.... A dream is a picture puzzle (Bilderrdtsel) of this sort and our
predecessors in the field of

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING 275

dream-interpretation have made the mistake of treating the rebus as a
pictorial composition" (IV, 277-78). The figurative content is then
indeed a form of writing, a signifying chain in scenic form. In that
sense, of course, it summarizes a discourse, it is the economy of speech. The
entire chapter on "Representability" (Aptitude a la mise en scene; Darstell
barkeit) shows this quite well. But the reciprocal economic transform
ation, the total reassimilation into discourse, is, in principle, impossible
or limited. This is first of all because words are also and "primarily"
things. Thus, in dreams they are absorbed, "caught" by the primary
process. It is then not sufficient to say that in dreams, words are con
densed by "things"; and that inversely, nonverbal signifiers may be
interpreted to a certain degree in terms of verbal representations. It
must be seen that insofar as they are attracted, lured into the dream,
toward the fictive limit of the primary process, words tend to become
things pure and simple. An equally fictive limit, moreover. Pure words and
pure things are thus, like the idea of the primary process, and
consequently, the secondary process, "theoretical fictions" (V, 603). The
interval in "dreams" and the interval in "wakefulness" may not be
distinguished essentially insofar as the nature of language is concerned.
"Words are often treated as things in dreams and thus undergo the
same operations as thing presentations."" In the formal regression of
dreams, words are not overtaken by the spatialization of representation (muse
en scene). Formal regression could not even succeed, moreover, if words had
not always been subject in their materiality to the mark of their inscription
or scenic capacity, their Darstellbarkeit and all the forms of their spacing. This
last factor could only have been repressed by socalled living, vigilant
speech, by consciousness, logic, the history of language, etc. Spatialization
does not surprise the time of speech or the ideality of meaning, it does not
happen to them like an accident. Temporalization presupposes the
possibility of symbolism, and every symbolic synthesis, even before it falls
into a space "exterior" to it, includes within itself spacing as difference.
Which is why the pure phonic chain, to the extent that it implies
differences, is itself not a pure continuum or flow of time. Difference is
the articulation of space and time. The phonic chain or the chain of
phonetic writing are always already distended by that minimum of
essential spacing upon which the dream-work and any formal regression
in general can begin to

operate. It is not a question of a negation of time, of a cessation of time in
a present or a simultaneity, but of a different structure, a different
stratification of time. Here, once more, a comparison with writingphonetic writing this time-casts light on writing as well as on dreams:
They [dreams] reproduce logical connection by simultaneity in time. Here
they are acting like the painter who, in a picture of the School of Athens or
of Parnassus, represents in one group all the philosophers or all the poets
who were never, in fact, assembled in a single hall or on a single mountain
top.... Dreams carry this mode of reproduction (mise en scene) down to
details. Whenever they show us two elements close together, this
guarantees that there is some specially intimate connection between what
corresponds to them among the dreamthoughts. In the same way, in our
system of writing, "ab" means that the two letters are to be pronounced in a
single syllable. If a gap is left between the "a" and the "b," it means that
the "a" is the last letter of one word and the "b" is the first of the next one
[IV, 314].
The model of hieroglyphic writing assembles more strikinglythough we
find it in every form of writing-the diversity of the modes and
functions of signs in dreams. Every sign-verbal or otherwisemay be
used at different levels, in configurations and functions which are never
prescribed by its "essence," but emerge from a play of differences.
Summarizing all these possibilities, Freud concludes: "Yet, in spite of all
this ambiguity, it is fair to say that the productions (raises en scene) of the
dream-work, which, it must be remembered, are not made with the intention
of being understood, present no greater difficulties to their translators than do
the ancient hieroglyphic scripts to those who seek to read them" (V,
341).
More than twenty years separate the first edition of the Traumdeutung from
the "Note on the Mystic Writing-Pad." If we continue to follow the two
series of metaphors-those concerning the nonpsychical system of the
psychical and those concerning the psychical itself-what happens?
On the one hand, the theoretical import of the psychographic metaphor will be
increasingly refined. A methodological inquiry will, to a certain extent,
be devoted to it. It is with a graphematics still to come, rather

than with a linguistics dominated by an ancient phonologism, that
psychoanalysis sees itself as destined to collaborate. Freud recommends
this literally in a text from 1913, and in this case we have nothing to add,
interpret, alter." The interest which psychoanalysis brings to linguistics
presupposes an "overstepping of the habitual meaning of the word
'speech.' For in what follows 'speech' must be understood not merely to
mean the expression of thought in words, but to include the speech of
gesture and every other method, such, for instance, as writing, by which
mental activity can be expressed" (XIII, 176). And having recalled the
archaic character of expression in dreams, which accepts contradiction 24
and valorizes visibility, Freud specifies:
It seems to us more appropriate to compare dreams with a system of
writing than with language. In fact, the interpretation of a dream is
completely analogous to the decipherment of an ancient pictographic
script such as Egyptian hieroglyphics. In both cases there are certain
elements which are not intended to be interpreted (or read, as the case may
be) but are only designed to serve as "determinatives," that is to establish
the meaning of some other element. The ambiguity of various elements of
dreams finds a parallel in these ancient systems of writing .... If this
conception of the method of representation in dreams (mise en scene) has
not yet been followed up, this, as will be readily understood, must be ascribed
to the fact that psycho-analysts are entirely ignorant of the attitude and
knowledge with which a philologist would approach such a problem as that
presented by dreams [X111,177].
On the other hand, the same year, in the article on "The Unconscious," the
problematic of the apparatus itself will begin to be taken up in terms of
scriptural concepts: neither, as in the Project, in a topology of traces
without writing, nor, as in the Traumdeutung, in the operations of optical
mechanisms. The debate between the functional hypothesis and the
topographical hypothesis concerns the locations of an inscription (Niederschrift): "When a psychical act (let us confine ourselves here to one
which is in the nature of an idea [Vorstellung, lit. representation] is transposed from the systems Ucs. into the system Cs. (or PCs.), are we to

which writing has always claimed for itself.
Auxiliary apparatuses (Hilfsapparate), which, as Freud notes, are always
constituted on the model of the organ to be supplemented (e.g., spectacles, camera, ear trumpet) thus seem particularly deficient when memory
is in question. This remark makes even more suspect the earlier
reference to optical apparatuses. Freud recalls, nevertheless, that the
contradictory requirement he is presenting had already been recognized in
1900. He could have said in 1895. "As long ago as in 1900 1 gave expression
in The Interpretation of Dreams to a suspicion that this unusual capacity was
to be divided between two different systems (or organs of the mental
apparatus). According to this view, we possess a system Pcpt.-Cs., which
receives perceptions but retains no permanent trace of them, so that it
can react like a clean sheet to every new perception; while the
permanent traces of the excitations which have been received are
preserved in 'mnemic systems' lying behind the perceptual system. Later,
in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), I added a remark to the effect that the
inexplicable phenomenon of consciousness arises in the perceptual system
instead of the permanent traces"
(XIX, 228). 27
A double system contained in a single differentiated apparatus: a
perpetually available innocence and an infinite reserve of traces have at last
been reconciled by the "small contrivance" placed "some time ago upon
the market under the name of the Mystic Writing-Pad," and which
"promises to perform more than the sheet of paper or the slate." Its
appearance is modest, "but if it is examined more closely, it will be
found that its construction shows a remarkable agreement with my
hypothetical structure of our perceptual apparatus." It offers both
advantages: an ever-ready receptive surface and permanent traces of the
inscriptions that have been made on it" (ibid.). Here is its description:
The Mystic Pad is a slab of dark brown resin or wax with a paper edging; over
the slab is laid a thin transparent sheet, the top end of which is firmly
secured to the slab while its bottom end rests upon it without being fixed to
it. This transparent sheet is the more interesting part of the little device. It
itself consists of two layers which can be detached from each other except at
their two ends. The upper layer is a

transparent piece of celluloid; the lower layer is made of thin translucent
waxed paper. When the apparatus is not in use, the lower surface of the
waxed paper adheres lightly to the upper surface of the wax slab.
To make use of the Mystic Pad, one writes upon the celluloid portion of
the covering-sheet which rests upon the wax slab. For this purpose
no pencil or chalk is necessary, since the writing does not depend on
material being deposited upon the receptive surface. It is a return to the
ancient method of writing upon tablets of clay or wax: a pointed stilus
scratches the surface, the depressions upon which constitute the "writing."
In the case of the Mystic Pad this scratching is not effected directly, but
through the medium of the covering-sheet. At the points which the stilus
touches, it presses the lower surface of the waxed paper on to the wax slab,
and the grooves are visible as dark writing upon the otherwise smooth
whitish-gray surface of the celluloid. If one wishes to destroy what has been
written, all that is necessary is to raise the double covering-sheet from the
wax slab by a light pull, starting from the free lower end.ze The close
contact between the waxed paper and the wax slab at the places which have
been scratched (upon which the visibility of the writing depended) is thus
brought to an end and it does not recur when the two surfaces come
together once more. The Mystic Pad is now clear of writing and ready to
receive fresh inscriptions [XIX, 228-29].
Let us note that the depth of the Mystic Pad is simultaneously a depth
without bottom, an infinite allusion, and a perfectly superficial exteriority: a stratification of surfaces each of whose relation to itself, each of
whose interior, is but the implication of another similarly exposed
surface. It joins the two empirical certainties by which we are constituted: infinite depth in the implication of meaning, in the unlimited
envelopment of the present, and, simultaneously, the pellicular essence of
being, the absolute absence of any foundation.
Neglecting the device's "slight imperfections," interested only in the
analogy, Freud insists on the essentially protective nature of the celluloid
sheet. Without it, the fine waxed paper would be scratched or ripped.
There is no writing which does not devise some means of protection,
to protect against itself, against the writing by which the

"subject" is himself threatened as he lets himself be written: as he exposes
himself "The layer of celluloid thus acts as a protective sheath for the
waxed paper." It shields the waxed paper from "injurious effects from
without." " 1 may at this point recall that in Beyond the Pleasure Principle,' I showed
that the perceptual apparatus of our mind consists of two layers, of an
external protective shield against stimuli whose task it is to diminish the
strength of excitations coming in, and of a surface behind it which
receives the stimuli, namely the system Pcpt.-Cs" (XIX, 230).
But this still concerns only reception or perception, the most superficial
surface's openness to the incision of a scratch. There is as yet no writing in
the flatness of this extensia. We must account for writing as a trace
which survives the scratch's present, punctuality, and stigme. "This analogy,"
Freud continues, "would not be of much value if it could not be pursued
further than this." This is the second analogy: "If we lift the entire coveringsheet-both the celluloid and the waxed paper-off the wax slab, the
writing vanishes, and, as I have already remarked, does not re-appear
again. The surface of the Mystic Pad is clear of writing and once more
capable of receiving impressions. But it is easy to discover that the
permanent trace of what was written is retained upon the wax slab itself
and is legible in suitable lights" (ibid.). The contradictory requirements
are satisfied by this double system, and "this is precisely the way in
which, according to the hypothesis which I mentioned just now, our
psychical apparatus performs its perceptual function. The layer which
receives the stimuli-the system Pcpt.-Cs.forms no permanent traces; the
foundations of memory come about in other, supplementary, systems"
(ibid.). Writing supplements perception before perception even appears
to itself [is conscious of itself]. "Memory" or writing is the opening of
that process of appearance itself The "perceived" may be read only in the
past, beneath perception
and after it30
Whereas other writing surfaces, corresponding to the prototypes of
slate or paper, could represent only a materialized part of the mnemic
system in the psychical apparatus, an abstraction, the Mystic Pad represents
the apparatus in its entirety, not simply in its perceptual layer. The wax
slab, in fact, represents the unconscious: "I do not think it is too farfetched to compare the wax slab with the unconscious behind the
system Pcpt.-Cs." (XIX, 230-31). The becoming-visible which

alternates with the disappearance of what is written would be the
flickering-up (Aufleuchten) and passing-away (Vergehen) of consciousness in
the process of perception.
This introduces the third and final analogy. It is certainly the most interesting. Until now, it has been a question only of the space of writing, its
extension and volume, reliefs and depressions. But there is as well a time of
writing, and this time of writing is nothing other than the very structure of
that which we are now describing. We must come to terms with the
temporality of the wax slab. For it is not outside the slab, and the Mystic
Pad includes in its structure what Kant describes as the three modes of time
in the three analogies of experience: permanence, succession, simultaneity.
Descartes, when he wonders quaenam veto est haec cera, can reduce its
essence to the timeless simplicity of an intelligible object." Freud,
reconstructing an operation, can reduce neither time nor the multiplicity
of sensitive layers. And he will link a discontinuist conception of time, as the
periodicity and spacing of writing, to a whole chain of hypotheses which
stretch from the Letters to Fliess to Beyond the Pleasure Principle, and which,
once again, are constructed, consolidated, confirmed, and solidified in the
Mystic Pad. Temporality as spacing will be not only the horizontal
discontinuity of a chain of signs, but also will be writing as the
interruption and restoration of contact between the various depths of
psychical levels: the remarkably heterogeneous temporal fabric of psychical
work itself We find neither the continuity of a line nor the homogeneity of a
volume; only the differentiated duration and depth of a stage, and its
spacing:
But I must admit that I am inclined to press the comparison still fur th er . On the
My s t i c P ad the wr iti n g vani sh ed ever y ti m e t he cl o se contact is broken

This hypothesis posits a discontinuous distribution-through rapid

284

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

Pcpt.-Cs. These movements are then "withdrawn" or "removed." Consciousness fades each time the cathexis is withdrawn in this way. Freud
compares this movement to the feelers which the unconscious would
stretch out toward the external world, and which it would withdraw
when these feelers had sampled the excitations coming from the external
world in order to warn the unconscious of any threat. (Freud had no more
reserved the image of the feeler for the unconscious-we find it in chapter 4 of
Beyond the Pleasure principle 32-than he had reserved
the notion of cathectic periodicity, as we noted above.) The "origin of
our concept of time" is attributed to this "periodic non-excitability"
and to this "discontinuous method of functioning of the system Pcpt.
Cs." Time is the economy of a system of writing.
The machine does not run by itself. It is less a machine than a tool. And
it is not held with only one hand. This is the mark of its temporality. Its
maintenance is not simple. The ideal virginity of the present (maintenant) is
constituted by the work of memory. At least two hands are needed to
make the apparatus function, as well as a system of gestures, a coordination
of independent initiatives, an organized multiplicity of origins. It is at this
stage that the "Note" ends: "If we imagine one hand writing upon the

as the idea of the primary process. For that idea is contradicted by the
theme of primal repression.
Writing is unthinkable without repression. The condition for writing is
that there be neither a permanent contact nor an absolute break between
strata: the vigilance and failure of censorship. It is no accident that the
metaphor of censorship should come from the area of politics concerned
with the deletions, blanks, and disguises of writing, even if, at the
beginning of the Traumdeutung, Freud seems to make only a conventional,
didactic reference to it. The apparent exteriority of political censorship
refers to an essential censorship which binds the writer to his own writing.
If there were only perception, pure permeability to breaching, there
would be no breaches. We would be written, but nothing would be
recorded; no writing would be produced, retained, repeated as legibility.
But pure perception does not exist: we are written only as we write, by the
agency within us which always already keeps watch over perception, be it
internal or external. The "subject" of writing does not exist if we mean by
that some sovereign solitude of the author. The subject of writing is a
system of relations between strata: the Mystic Pad, the psyche, society,
the world. Within that scene, on that stage, the punc

describe the structure, it is not enough to recall that one always writes
for someone; and the oppositions sender-receiver, code-message, etc.,
remain extremely coarse instruments. We would search the "public" in vain
for the first reader: i.e., the first author of a work. And the "soci
ology of literature" is blind to the war and the ruses perpetrated by the
author who reads and by the first reader who dictates, for at stake here is the
origin of the work itself. The sociality of writing as drama requires
an entirely different discipline.
That the machine does not run by itself means something else: a
mechanism without its own energy. The machine is dead. It is death.
Not because we risk death in playing with machines, but because the
'gin of machines is the relation to death. In a letter to Fliess, it will be
called, Freud, evoking his representation of the psychical apparatus,
had the impression of being faced with a machine which would soon
by itself. But what was to run by itself was the psyche and not its
'tation or mechanical representation. For the latter does not live.

286

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

Representation is death. Which may be immediately transformed into the
following proposition: death is (only) representation. But it is bound to
life and to the living present which it repeats originarily. A pure
representation, a machine, never runs by itself Such at least is the
limitation which Freud recognizes in his analogy with the Mystic Pad.
Like the first section of the "Note," his gesture at this point is extremely
Platonic. Only the writing of the soul, said the Phaedrus, only the psychical
trace is able to reproduce and to represent itself spontaneously. Our
reading had skipped over the following remark by Freud: "There must
come a point at which the analogy between an auxiliary apparatus of
this kind and the organ which is its prototype will cease to apply. It is true,
too, that once the writing has been erased, the Mystic Pad cannot
'reproduce' it from within; it would be a mystic pad indeed if, like our
memory, it could accomplish that" (XIX, 230). Abandoned to itself, the
multiplicity of layered surfaces of the apparatus is a dead complexity
without depth. Life as depth belongs only to the wax of psychical
memory. Freud, like Plato, thus continues to oppose hypomnemic writing
and writing en tei psychei, itself woven of traces, empirical memories of a
present truth outside of time. Henceforth, the Mystic Pad, separated from
psychical responsibility, a repre
sentation abandoned to itself, still participates in Cartesian space and
mechanics: natural wax, exteriority of the memory aid.
All that Freud had thought about the unity of life and death, how
ever, should have led him to ask other questions here. And to ask them
explicitly. Freud does not explicitly examine the status of the "material
ized" supplement which is necessary to the alleged spontaneity of
memory, even if that spontaneity were differentiated in itself, thwarted
by a censorhsip or repression which, moreover, could not act on a
perfectly spontaneous memory. Far from the machine being a pure
absence of spontaneity, its resemblance to the psychical apparatus, its
existence and its necessity bear witness to the finitude of the mnemic
spontaneity which is thus supplemented. The machine-and, con
sequently, representation-is death and finitude within the psyche. Nor
does Freud examine the possibility of this machine, which, in the
world, has at least begun to resemble memory, and increasingly
resembles it more closely. Its resemblance to memory is closer than
that of the innocent Mystic Pad: the latter is no doubt infinitely more

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING

287

complex than slate or paper, less archaic than a palimpsest; but, com
pared to other machines for storing archives, it is a child's toy. This
resemblance-i.e., necessarily a certain Being-in-the-world of the
psyche-did not happen to memory from without, any more than
death surprises life. It founds memory. Metaphor-in this case the
analogy between two apparatuses and the possibility of this represen
tational relation-raises a question which, despite his premises, and
for reasons which are no doubt essential, Freud failed to make explicit,
at the very moment when he had brought this question to the thresh
old of being thematic and urgent. Metaphor as a rhetorical or didactic
device is possible here only through the solid metaphor, the
"unnatural," historical production of a supplementary machine, added to
the psychical organization in order to supplement its finitude. The very
idea of finitude is derived from the movement of this supplementarity.
The historico-technical production of this metaphor which survives
individual (that is, generic) psychical organization, is of an entirely
different order than the production of an intrapsychical metaphor,
assuming that the latter exists (to speak about it is not enough for that), and
whatever bond the two metaphors may maintain between themselves. Here
the question of technology (a new name must perhaps be found in order to
remove it from its traditional problematic) may not be derived from an
assumed opposition between the psychical and the nonpsychical, life and
death. Writing, here, is recline as the relation between life and death,
between present and representation, between the two apparatuses. It opens
up the question of technics: of the apparatus in general and of the analogy
between the psychical apparatus and the nonpsychical apparatus. In this sense
writing is the stage of history and the play of the world. It cannot be
exhausted by psychology alone That which, in Freud's discourse, opens
itself to the theme of writing results in psychoanalysis being not simply
psychology-nor simply psychoanalysis.
Thus are perhaps augured, in the Freudian breakthrough, a beyond
and a beneath of the closure we might term "Platonic." In that moment of
world history "subsumed" by the name of Freud, by means of an
unbelievable mythology (be it neurological or metapsychological: for we
never dreamed of taking it seriously, outside of the question which
disorganizes and disturbs its literalness, the metapsychological fable,

2 88

which marks perhaps only a minimal advance beyond the neurological tales
of the Project), a relationship to itself of the historicotranscendental
stage of writing was spoken without being said, thought without being
thought: was written and simultaneously erased, metaphorized;
designating itself while indicating intrawordly relations, it was represented.
This may perhaps be recognized (as an example and let this be understood
prudently) insofar as Freud too, with admirable scope and continuity, performed
for us the scene of writing. But we must think of this scene in other terms than those of
individual or collective psychology, or even of anthropology. It must be
thought in the horizon of the scene/stage of the world, as the history of
that scene/stage. Freud's language is caught up in it.
Thus Freud performs for us the scene of writing. Like all those who
write. And like all who know how to write, he let the scene duplicate,
repeat, and betray itself within the scene. It is Freud then whom we will
allow to say what scene he has played for us. And from him that we
shall borrow the hidden epigraph which has silently governed our
reading.
In following the advance of the metaphors of path, trace, breach, of the
march treading down a track which was opened by effraction through
neurone, light or wax, wood or resin, in order violently to inscribe itself
in nature, matter, or matrix; and in following the untiring reference to a dry
stilus and a writing without ink; and in following the inexhaustible
inventiveness and dreamlike renewal of mechanical models-the metonymy
perpetually at work on the same metaphor, obstinately substituting
trace for trace and machine for machine-we
have been wondering just what Freud was doing.
And we have been thinking of those texts where, better than anywhere
else, he tells us worin die Bahnung sonst besteht. In what pathbreaking consists.
Of the Traumdeutung: "It is highly probable that all complicated
machinery and apparatuses occurring in dreams stand for the genitals (and
as a rule male ones), in describing which dream-symbolism is as
indefatigable as the joke-work (Witzarbeit) " (V, 356).
Then, of Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety: "As soon as writing, which
entails making a liquid flow out of a tube onto a piece of white paper,

FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING 289

assumes the significance of copulation, or as soon as walking becomes a
symbolic substitute for treading upon the body of mother earth, both
writing and walking are stopped because they represent the performance
of a forbidden sexual act" (XX, 90).
The last part of the lecture concerned the archi-trace as erasure: erasure
of the present and thus of the subject, of that which is proper to, the
subject and of his proper name. The concept of a (conscious or
unconscious) subject necessarily refers to the concept of substanceand
thus of presence-out of which it is born.
Thus, the Freudian concept of trace must be radicalized and extracted
from the metaphysics of presence which still retains it (particularly in the
concepts of consciousness, the unconscious, perception, memory, reality,
and several others).
The trace is the erasure of selfhood, of one's own presence, and is
constituted by the threat or anguish of its irremediable disappearance, of the
disappearance of its disappearance. An unerasable trace is not a trace, it is a
full presence, an immobile and uncorruptible substance, a son of God, a
sign of parousia and not a seed, that is, a mortal germ.
.This erasure is death itself, and it is within its horizon that we must
conceive not only the "present," but also what Freud doubtless believed to be
the indelibility of certain traces in the unconscious, where "nothing ends,
nothing happens, nothing is forgotten." This erasure of the trace is not
only an accident that can occur here or there, nor is it even the necessary
structure of a determined censorship threatening a given presence; it is the
very structure which makes possible, as the movement of temporalization
and pure auto-affection, something that can be called repression in general,
the original synthesis of original repression and secondary repression,
repression "itself."
Such a radicalization of the thought of the trace (a thought because it escapes
binarism and makes binarism possible on the basis of nothing), would be
fruitful not only in the deconstruction of logocentrism, but in a kind of
reflection exercised more positively in different fields, at different levels
of writing in general, at the point of articulation of
riling in the current sense and of the trace in general.
These fields, whose specificity thereby could be opened to a thought
fecundated by psychoanalysis, would be numerous. The problem of

extent that this problem could not
In question, first, would be:
1. A psychopathology of everyday life in which the study of writing would
not be limited to the interpretation of the lapsus calami, and, moreover,
would be more attentive to this latter and to its originality than Freud
himself ever was. "Slips of the pen, to which I now pass, are so closely akin
to slips of the tongue that we have nothing new to expect from them',`
(XV, 69). This did prevent Freud from raising the fundamental juridical"
problem of responsibility, before the tribunal of psychoanalysis, as
2. A history of writing, an immense field in which only
work has been done up to now; however admirable this work has been, it
still gives way, beyond its empirical discoveries, to unbridled
speculation.
3. A becoming-literary of the literal. Here, despite several attempts made
by Freud and certain of his successors, a psychoanalysis of literature
respectful of the originality of the literary signifier has not yet begun, and this
is surely not an accident. Until now, only the analysis of literary signifieds, that
is, nonliterary signified meanings, has been undertaken. But such questions
refer to the entire history of literary forms themselves, and to the history
of everything within them which was destined precisely to authorize this
disdain of the signifier.
4. Finally, to continue designating these fields according to traditional and problematic boundaries, what might be called a new psychoanalytic graphology, which would take into account the contributions of the
three kinds of research we have just outlined roughtly. Here, Melanie
Klein perhaps opens the way. As concerns the forms of signs, even within
phonetic writing, the cathexes of gestures, and of movements, of letters,
lines, points, the elements of the writing apparatus (instrument, surface,
substance, etc.), a text like The Role of the School in the Libidinal Development of the
Child (1923) indicates the direction to be taken (cf. also, Strachey, Some Unconscious
Factors in Reading).
Melanie Klein's entire thematic, her analysis of the constitution of
good and bad objects, her genealogy of morals could doubtless begin
to illuminate, if followed prudently, the entire problem of the

archi-trace, not in its essence (it does not have one), but in terms of
valuation and devaluation. Writing as sweet nourishment or as excrement, the trace as seed or mortal germ, wealth or weapon, detritus
and/or penis, etc.
How, for example, on the stage of history, can writing as excrement
separated from the living flesh and the sacred body of the hieroglyph
(Artaud), be put into communication with what is said in Numbers
about the parched woman drinking the inky dust of the law; or what is
said in Exekiel about the son of man who fills his entrails with the scroll
of the law which has become sweet as honey in his mouth?

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

everything that it must ravage in its wake, "the theater of cruelty / is
not the symbol of an absent void." It affirms, it produces affirmation
itself in its full and necessary rigor. But also in its most hidden sense, the
sense most often buried, most often diverted from itself: "implacable" as
it is, this affirmation has "not yet begun to exist."
It is still to be born. Now a necessary affirmation can be born only by
being reborn to itself. For Artaud, the future of the theater-thus, the
future in general-is opened only by the anaphora which dates from
the eve prior to birth. Theatricality must traverse and restore "existence"
and "flesh" in each of their aspects. Thus, whatever can be said of the
body can be said of the theater. As we know, Artaud lived the morrow of a
dispossession: his proper body, the property and propriety of his body,
had been stolen from him at birth by the thieving god who was born in
order "to pass himself off / as me."' Rebirth doubtless occurs throughArtaud recalls this often-a kind of reeducation of the organs. But this
reeducation permits the access to a life before birth and after death
("...through dying / I have finally achieved real immortality," p. 110),
and not to a death before birth and after life. This is what distinguishes
the affirmation of cruelty from romantic negativity; the difference is
slight and yet decisive. Lichtenberger: "I

cannot rid myself of this idea that I was dead before I was born, and that
through death I will return to this very state.... To die and to be
eborn with the memory of one's former existence is called fainting; to
awaken with other organs which must first be reeducated is called
birth." For Artaud, the primary concern is not to die in dying, not to let
the thieving god divest him of his life. "And I believe that there is
always someone else, at the extreme moment of death, to strip us of
Similarly, Western theater has been separated from the force of its
essence, removed from its affirmative essence, its vis affirmative. And this
dispossession occurred from the origin on, is the very movement of
origin, of birth as death.
This is why a "place" is "left on all the stages of stillborn theater"
("Le theatre et l'anatomie," in La rue, July 1946). The theater is born in its
own disappearance, and the offspring of this movement has a name: man.
The theater of cruelty is to be born by separating death from birth and by
erasing the name of man. The theater has always been made to

do that for which it was not made: "The last word on man has not been
said.... The theater was never made to describe man and what he
does.... Et le theatre est cc patin degingande, qui musique de troncs par barbes
metalliques de barbeles nous maintient en etat de guerre contre l'homme qui nous
corsetait.... Man is quite ill in Aeschylus, but still thinks of himself
somewhat as a god and does not want to enter the membrane, and in
Euripides, finally, he splashes about in the membrane, forgetting where and
when he was a god" (ibid.).
Indeed, the eve of the origin of this declining, decadent, and negative
Western theater must be reawakened and reconstituted in order to revive
the implacable necessity of affirmation on its Eastern horizon. This is the
implacable necessity of an as yet inexistent stage, certainly, but the
affirmation is not to be elaborated tomorrow, in some "new theater." Its
implacable necessity operates as a permanent force. Cruelty is always at
work. The void, the place that is empty and waiting for this theater which
has not yet "begun to exist," thus measures only the strange distance
which separates us from implacable necessity, from the present (or rather the
contemporary, active) work of affirmation. Within the space of the unique
opening of this distance, the stage of cruelty rears its enigma for us. And
it is into this opening that we wish to enter here.
If throughout the world today-and so many examples bear witness to
this in the most striking fashion-all theatrical audacity declares its
fidelity to Artaud (correctly or incorrectly, but with increasing insistency), then the question of the theater of cruelty, of its present inexistence
and its implacable necessity, has the value of a historic question. A historic
question not because it could be inscribed within what is called the
history of theater, not because it would be epoch-making within the
becoming of theatrical forms, or because it would occupy a position
within the succession of models of theatrical representation. This question
is historic in an absolute and radical sense. It announces the limit of
representation.
The theater of cruelty is not a representation. It is life itself, in the extent to
which life is unrepresentable. Life is the nonrepresentable origin of
representation. "I have therefore said 'cruelty' as I might have said 'life"' (TD,
p. 114). This life carries man along with it, but is not primarily the life of
man. The latter is only a representation of life, and such is the

limit-the humanist limit-of the metaphysics of classical theater. "The theater
as we practice it can therefore be reproached with a terrible lack of
imagination. The theater must make itself the equal of life-not an
individual life, that individual aspect of life in which CHARACTERS
triumph, but the sort of liberated life which sweeps away human
individuality and in which man is only a reflection" (TD, p. 116).
Is not the most naive form of representation mimesis? Like Nietzscheand the affinities do not end there-Artaud wants to have done with the
imitative concept of art, with the Aristotelean aesthetics' in which the
metaphysics of Western art comes into its own. "Art is not the imitation of
life, but life is the imitation of a transcendental principle which art puts
us into communication with once again" (OC
4:3 10).
Theatrical art should be the primordial and privileged site of this
destruction of imitation: more than any other art, it has been marked by
the labor of total representation in which the affirmation of life lets itself
be doubled and emptied by negation. This representation, whose structure
is imprinted not only on the art, but on the entire culture of the West
(its religions, philosophies, politics), therefore designates more than just
a particular type of theatrical construction. This is why the question put
to us today by far exceeds the bounds of theatrical technology. Such is
Artaud's most obstinate affirmation: technical or theatrological reflection
is not to be treated marginally. The decline of the theater doubtless begins
with the possibility of such a dissociation. This can be emphasized without
weakening the importance or interest of theatrological problems, or of
the revolutions which may occur within the limits of theatrological
problems, or of the revolutions which may occur within the limits of
theatrical technique. But Artaud's intention indicates these limits. For as
long as these technical and intratheatrical revolutions do not penetrate
the very foundations of Western theater, they will belong to the history
and to the stage that Antonin Artaud wanted to explode.
What does it mean to break this structure of belonging? Is it possible to
do so? Under what conditions can a theater today legitimately invoke
Artaud's name? It is only a fact that so many directors wish to be
acknowledged as Artaud's heirs, that is (as has been written), his
"illegitimate sons." The question of justification and legality must also

296

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

be raised. With what criteria can such a claim be recog-nized as
unfounded? Under what conditions could an authentic "theater of
cruelty" "begin to exist"? These simultaneously technical and "metaphysical" questions (metaphysical in the sense understood by Artaud), arise
spontaneously from the reading of all the texts in The Theater and Its Double, for
these texts are more solicitations than a sum of precepts, more a system of
critiques shaking the entirety of Occidental history than a treatise on theatrical
practice.
The theater of cruelty expulses God from the stage. It does not put a
new atheist discourse on stage, or give atheism a platform, or give over
theatrical space to a philosophizing logic that would once more, to our
greater lassitude, proclaim the death of God. The theatrical practice of
cruelty, in its action and structure, inhabits or rather produces a
nontheologicalspace.
The stage is theological for as long as it is dominated by speech, by a will
to speech, by the layout of a primary logos which does not belong to the
theatrical site and governs it from a distance. The stage is theological for as
long as its structure, following the entirety of tradition, comports the
following elements: an author-creator who, absent and from afar, is
armed with a text and keeps watch over, assembles, regulates the time or
the meaning of representation, letting this latter represent him as concerns
what is called the content of his thoughts, his intentions, his ideas. He
lets representation represent him through representatives, directors or
actors, enslaved interpreters who represent characters who, primarily
through what they say, more or less directly represent the thought of the
"creator." Interpretive slaves who faithfully execute the providential
designs of the "master." Who moreover-and this is the ironic rule of the
representative structure which organizes all these relationships-creates
nothing, has only the illusion of having created, because he only
transcribes and makes available for reading a text whose nature is itself
necessarily representative; and this representative text maintains with
what is called the "real (the existing real, the "reality" about which
Artaud said, in the "Avertissement" to Le moine, that it is an "excrement of
the mind") an

imitative and reproductive relationship. Finally, the theological stage comports
a passive, seated public, a public of spectators, of consumers,

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

297

of "enjoyers"-as Nietzsche and Artaud both say-attending a production
that lacks true volume or depth, a production that is level, offered to their
voyeuristic scrutiny. (In the theater of cruelty, pure visibility is not exposed
to voyeurism.) This general structure in which each agency is linked
to all the others by representation, in which the irrepresentability of
the living present is dissimulated or dissolved, suppressed or deported
within the infinite chain of representationsthis structure has never been
modified. All revolutions have maintained it intact, and most often have
tended to protect or restore it. And it is the phonetic text, speech,
transmitted discourse-eventually transmitted by the prompter whose hole
is the hidden but indispensable center of representative structure-which
ensures the movement of representation. Whatever their importance, all
the pictorial, musical and even gesticular forms introduced into Western
theater can only, in the best of cases, illustrate, accompany, serve, or
decorate a text, a verbal fabric, a logos which is said in the beginning. "If
then, the author is the man who arranges the language of speech and the
director is his slave, there is merely a question of words. There is here a
confusion over terms, stemming from the fact that, for us, and according
to the sense generally attributed to the word director, this man is merely an
artisan, an adapter, a kind of translator eternally devoted to making a
dramatic work pass from one language into another; this confusion will be
possible and the director will be forced to play second fiddle to the author
only so long as there is a tacit agreement that the language of words is
superior to others and that the theater admits none other than this one
language" (TD, p. 119). This does not imply, of course, that to be
faithful to Artaud it suffices to give a great deal of importance and
responsibility to the "director" while maintaining the classical structure.
By virtue of the word (or rather the unity of the word and the
concept, as we will say later-and this specification will be important)
and beneath the theological ascendancy both of the "verb [which] is the
measure of our impotency" (OC 4:277) and of our fear, it is indeed he
stage which finds itself threatened throughout the Western tradition.
The Occident-and such is the energy of its essence-has worked only
for the erasure of the stage. For a stage which does nothing but illustrate a
discourse is no longer entirely a stage. Its relation to speech is its malady,
and "we repeat that the epoch is sick" (OC 4:28 0).

To reconstitute the stage, finally to put on stage and to overthrow the
tyranny of the text is thus one and the same gesture. "The triumph of
pure raise en scene" (OC 4:305).
This classical forgetting of the stage is then confused with the history of
theater and with all of Western culture; indeed, it even guaranteed their
unfolding. And yet, despite this "forgetting," the theater and its arts
have lived richly for over twenty-five centuries: an experience of
mutations and perturbations which cannot be set aside, despite the
peaceful and impassive immobility of the fundamental structures. Thus,
in question is not only a forgetting or a simple surface concealment. A
certain stage has maintained with the "forgotten," but, in truth,
violently erased, stage a secret communication, a certain relationship of
betrayal, if to betray is at once to denature through infidelity, but also to let
oneself be evinced despite oneself, and to manifest the foundation of force.
This explains why classical theater, in Artaud's eyes, is not simply the
absence, negation, or forgetting of theater, is not a nontheater: it is a
mark of cancellation that lets what it covers be read; and it is corruption
also, a "perversion," a seduction, the margin of an aberration whose
meaning and measure are visible only beyond birth, at the eve of
theatrical representation, at the origin of tragedy. Or, for example, in the
realm of the "Orphic Mysteries which subjugated Platoo" or the
"Mysteries of Eleusis" stripped of the interpretations with which they
have been covered, or the "pure beauty of which Plato, at least once in
this world, must have found the complete, sonorous, streaming naked
realization" (TD, p. 52). Artaud is indeed speaking of perversion and not
of forgetting, for example, in this letter to Benjamin Cremieux:
The theater, an independent and autonomous art, must, in order to revive or
simply to live, realize what differentiates it from text, pure speech, literature,
and all other fixed and written means. We can perfectly well continue to
conceive of a theater based upon the authority of the text, and on a text
more and more wordy, diffuse, and boring, to which the esthetics of the
stage would be subject. But this conception of theater, which consists of
having people sit on a certain number of straight-backed or overstuffed
chairs placed in a row and tell each other stories, however marvelous, is,
if not the absolute

negation of theater-which does not absolutely require movement
in order to be what it should-certainly its perversion [TD, p. io6; my
italics].

Released from the text and the author-god, mise en scene would be
returned to its creative and founding freedom. The director and the
participants (who would no longer be actors or spectators) would cease to
be the instruments and organs of representation. Is this to say that
Artaud would have refused the name representation for the theater of
cruelty? No, provided that we clarify the difficult and equivocal meaning
of this notion. Here, we would have to be able to play upon all the
German words that we indistinctly translate with the unique word
representation. The stage, certainly, will no longer represent, since it will not
operate as an addition, as the sensory illustration of a text already
written, thought, or lived outside the stage, which the stage would then
only repeat but whose fabric it would not constitute. The stage will no
longer operate as the repetition of a present, will no longer re-present a
present that would exist elsewhere and prior to it, a present that would
exist elsewhere and prior to it, a present whose plenitude would be older
than it, absent from it, and rightfully capable of doing without it: the
being-present-to-itself of the absolute Logos, the living present of God.
Nor will the stage be a representation, if representation means the surface
of a spectacle displayed for spectators. It will not even offer the
presentation of a present, if present signifies that which is maintained in
front of me. Cruel representation must permeate me. And
nonrepresentation is, thus, original representation, if representation
signifies, also, the unfolding of a volume, a multidimensional milieu, an
experience which produces its own space. Spacing [espacement], that is
to say, the production of a space that no speech could condense or
comprehend (since speech primarily presupposes this spacing), thereby
appeals to a time that is no longer that of so-called phonic linearity,
appeals to "a new notion of space" and "a specific idea of time" (TD, p.
124). "We intend to base the theater upon spectacle before everything
else, and we shall introduce into the spectacle a new notion of space
utilized on all possible levels and in all degrees of perspective in depth
and height, and within this notion a specific idea of time will be added to
that of movement . .

function within a system to which it will be coordinated. For it is
known that the representations of the theater of cruelty had to be
painstakingly determined in advance. The absence of an author and his text
does not abandon the stage to dereliction. The stage is not forsaken, given
over to improvisatory anarchy, to "chance vaticination" ( O C 4: 2 3 4) , to
"Copeau's improvisations" (TD, p. 109), to "Surrealist empiricism" ( O C
4: 3 1 3 ) , to commedia dell'arte, or to "the capriciousness of untrained inspiration"
(ibid.). Everything, thus, will be prescribed in a writing and a text whose
fabric will no longer resemble the model of classical representation. To
what place, then, will speech be assigned by this necessary prescription called
for by cruelty itself?
Speech and its notation-phonetic speech, an element of classical
theater-speech and its writing will be erased on the stage of cruelty
only in the extent to which they were allegedly dictation: at once citations
or recitations and orders. The director and the actor will no longer take
dictation: "Thus we shall renounce the theatrical superstition of the text
and the dictatorship of the writer" (TD, p . 1 2 4 ) . This is also the end of the
diction which made theater into an exercise of reading. The end of the fact
that for "certain theatrical amateurs this means
that a play read affords just as definite and as great a satisfaction as the
same play performed" (TD, p. 118).
How will speech and writing function then? They will once more
become gestures; and the logical and discursive intentions which speech
ordinarily uses in order to ensure its rational transparency, and in order to
purloin its body in the direction of meaning, will be reduced or
subordinated. And since this theft of the body by itself is indeed that
which leaves the body to be strangely concealed by the very thing that
constitutes it as diaphanousness, then the deconstitution of diaphanousness lays bare the flesh of the word, lays bare the word's sonority,
intonation, intensity-the shout that the articulations of language and
logic have not yet entirely frozen, that is, the aspect of oppressed
gesture which remains in all speech, the unique and irreplaceable
movement which the generalities of concept and repetition have never
finished rejecting. We know what value Artaud attributed to what is called-in
the present case, quite incorrectly-onomatopoeia. Glossopoeia, which
is neither an imitative language nor a creation of names, takes us back
to the borderline of the moment when the word

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

303

has not yet been born, when articulation is no longer a shout but not yet
discourse, when repetition is almost impossible, and along with it, language
in general: the separation of concept and sound, of signified and signifier,
of the pneumatical and the grammatical, the freedom of translation and
tradition, the movement of interpretation, the difference between the soul
and the body, the master and the slave, God and man, author and actor. This
is the eve of the origin of languages, and of the dialogue between theology
and humanism whose inextinguishable reoccurrence has never not been
maintained by the metaphysics of Western theater.'
Thus, it is less a question of constructing a mute stage than of constructing a stage whose clamor has not yet been pacified into words. The
word is the cadaver of psychic speech, and along with the language of life
itself the "speech before words"6 must be found again. Gesture and speech
have not yet been separated by the logic of representation. "I am adding
another language to the spoken language, and I am trying to restore to the
language of speech its old magic, its essential spellbinding power, for its
mysterious possibilities have been forgotten. When I say I will perform
no written play, I mean that I will perform no play based on writing and
speech, that in the spectacles I produce there will be a preponderant
physical share which could not be captured and written down in the
customary language of words, and that even the spoken and written
portions will be spoken and written in a new sense" (TD, p. 111).
What of this "new sense"? And first, what of this new theatrical
writing? This latter will no longer occupy the limited position of simply
being the notation of words, but will cover the entire range of this new
language: not only phonetic writing and the transcription of speech,
but also hieroglyphic writing, the writing in which phonetic elements are
coordinated to visual, pictorial, and plastic elements. The notion of
hieroglyphics is at the center of the First Manifesto: "Once aware of this
language in space, language of sounds, cries, lights, onomatopoeia, the
theater must organize it into veritable hieroglyphs, with the help of
characters and objects, and make use of their symbolism and
interconnections in relation to all organs and on all levels" (TD, p. 90).
On the stage of the dream, as described by Freud, speech has the

part of the illegibility and magnetic fascination of dreams" (CW 2:23),
Artaud therefore rejects the psychoanalyst as interpreter, secondremove
commentator, hermeneut, or theoretician. He would have rejected a
psychoanalytic theater with as much rigor as he condemned psychological
theater. And for the same reasons: his rejection of any secret interiority, of
the reader, of directive interpretations or of psychodramaturgy. "The
subconscious will not play any true rule on stage. We've had enough of the
confusion engendered between author and audience through the medium
of producers and actors. Too bad for analysts, students of the soul and
surrealists.... We are determined to safeguard the plays we put on
against any secret commentary" (CW 2:39). 9 By virtue of his situation
and his status, the psychoanalyst would belong to the structure of the
classical stage, to its societal form, its metaphysics, its religion, etc.
The theater of cruelty thus would not be a theater of the unconscious.
Almost the contrary. Cruelty is consciousness, is exposed lucidity. "There is
no cruelty without consciousness and without the application of
consciousness" (TD, p. 102). And this consciousness indeed lives upon a
murder, is the consciousness of this murder, as we suggested above. Artaud
says this in "The First Letter on Cruelty": "It is consciousness that gives to the
exercise of every act of life its blood-red

color, its cruel nuance, since it is understood that life is always
someone's death" (TD, p. 102).
Perhaps Artaud is also protesting against a certain Freudian description of
dreams as the substitutive fulfillment of desire, as the function
of vicariousness: through the theater, Artaud wants to return their
dignity to dreams and to make of them something more original, more free,
more affirmative than an activity of displacement. It is perhaps against a
certain image of Freudian thought that he writes in the First Manifesto:
"To consider the theater as a second-hand psychological or moral function,
and to believe that dreams themselves have only a substitute function,
is to diminish the profound poetic bearing of
dreams as well as of the theater" (TD, p. 92).
Finally, a psychoanalytic theater would risk being a desacralizing
theater, and thereby would confirm the West in its project and its
trajectory. The theater of cruelty is a hieratic theater. Regression toward the
unconscious (cf. TD, p. 47) fails if it does not reawaken the sacred, if'

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

it is not both the "mystic" experience of "revelation" and the manifestation
of life in their first emergence." We have seen the reasons why
hieroglyphics had to be substituted for purely phonic signs. It must be
added that the latter communicate less than the former with the
imagination of the sacred. "And through the hieroglyph of a breath I am
able to recover an idea of the sacred theater" (TD, p. 141). A new
epiphany of the supernatural and the divine must occur within cruelty. And
not despite but thanks to the eviction of God and the destruction of the
theater's theological machinery. The divine has been ruined by God. That
is to say, by man, who in permitting himself to be separated from Life by
God, in permitting himself to be usurped from his own birth, became
man by polluting the divinity of the divine. "For far from believing that
man invented the supernatural and the divine, I think it is man's age-old
intervention which has ultimately corrupted the divine within him" (TD,
p. 8). The restoration of divine cruelty, hence, must traverse the murder
of God, that is to say, primarily the murder of the man-God."
Perhaps we now can ask, not about the conditions under which a
modern theater could be faithful to Artaud, but in what cases it is
surely unfaithful to him. What might the themes of infidelity be, even
among those who invoke Artaud in the militant and noisy fashion we
all know? We will content ourselves with naming these themes. Without
a doubt, foreign to the theater of cruelty are:
1. All non-sacred theater.
2. All theater that privileges speech or rather the verb, all theater of
words, even if this privilege becomes that of a speech which is selfdestructive, which once more becomes gesture of hopeless reoccurrence, a
negative relation of speech to itself, theatrical nihilism, what is still called the
theater of the absurd. Such a theater would not only be consumed by
speech, and would not destroy the functioning of the classical stage, but
it also would not be, in the sense understood by Artaud (and doubtless by
Nietzsche), an affirmation.
3. All abstract theater which excludes something from the totality of art, and
thus, from the totality of life and its resources of signification: dance,
music, volume, depth of plasticity, visible images, sonority, phonicity,
etc. An abstract theater is a theater in which the totality of sense and the
senses is not consumed. One would incorrectly conclude

from this that it suffices to accumulate or to juxtapose all the arts in
order to create a total theater addressed to the "total man"1z (cf. TD, p.
123). Nothing could be further from addressing total man than an
assembled totality, an artificial and exterior mimicry. Inversely, certain
apparent exhaustions of stage technique sometimes more rigorously
pursue Artaud's trajectory. Assuming, which we do not, that there is
some sense in speaking of a fidelity to Artaud, to something like his
"message" (this notion already betrays him), then a rigorous, painstaking,
patient and implacable sobriety in the work of destruction, and an
economical acuity aiming at the master parts of a still quite solid
machine, are more surely imperative, today, than the general mobilization
of art and artists, than turbulence or improvised agitation under the
mocking and tranquil eyes of the police.
4. All theater of alienation. Alienation only consecrates, with
didactic insistence and systematic heaviness, the nonparticipation of
spectators (and even of directors and actors) in the creative act, in the
irruptive force fissuring the space of the stage. The Verfremdungseffekt"
remains the prisoner of a classical paradox and of "the European ideal of
art" which "attempts to cast the mind into an attitude distinct from force
but addicted to exaltation" (TD, p. 10). Since "in the 'theater of cruelty'
the spectator is in the center and the spectacle surrounds him" (TD, p.
81), the distance of vision is no longer pure, cannot be abstracted from
the totality of the sensory milieu; the infused spectator can no longer
constitute his spectacle and provide himself with its object. There is no longer
spectator or spectacle, but festival (cf. TD, p. 85). All the limits furrowing
classical theatricality (represented/representer, signified/signifier,
author/director/actors/spectators, stage/audience, text/interpretation,
etc.) were ethicometaphysical prohibitions, wrinkles, grimaces, rictusesthe symptoms of fear before the dangers of the festival. Within the
space of the festival opened by transgression, the distance of
representation should no longer be extendable. The festival of cruelty
lifts all footlights and protective barriers before the "absolute danger"
which is "without foundation": "I must have actors who are first of all
beings, that is to say, who on stage are not afraid of the true sensation of
the touch of a knife and the convulsionsabsolutely real for them-of a
supposed birth. Mounet-Sully believes in what he does and gives the
illusion of it, but he knows that he is

behind a protective barrier, me-I suppress the protective barrier"
(letter to Roger Blin, September 1945). As regards the festival, as
invoked by Artaud, and the menace of that which is "without foundation,"
the "happening" can only make us smile: it is to the theater of cruelty
what the carnival of Nice might be to the mysteries of Eleusis. This is
particularly so due to the fact that the happening substitutes political
agitation for the total revolution prescribed by Artaud. The festival must
be a political act. And the act of political revolution is theatrical.
5. All nonpolitical theater. We have indeed said that the festival
must be a political act and not the more or less eloquent, pedagogical, and
superintended transmission of a concept or a politico-moral vision of
the world. To reflect-which we cannot do here-the political sense of
this act and this festival, and the image of society which fascinates
Artaud's desire, one should come to invoke (in order to note the
greatest difference within the greatest affinity) all the elements in
Rousseau which establish communication between the critique of the
classical spectacle, the suspect quality of articulation in language, the
ideal of a public festival substituted for representation, and a certain
model of society perfectly present to itself in small communities which
render both useless and nefarious all recourse to representation at the
decisive moments of social life. That is, all recourse to political as well as
to theatrical representation, replacement, or delegation. It very
precisely could be shown that it is the "representer" that Rousseau
suspects in The Social Contract, as well as in the Letter to M. d'Alembert, where
he proposes the replacement of theatrical representations with public
festivals lacking all exhibition and spectacle, festivals without "anything
to see" in which the spectators themselves would become actors: "But
what then will be the objects of these entertainments? ... Nothing, if you
please.... Plant a stake crowned with flowers in the middle of a square;
gather the people together there, and you will have a festival. Do
better yet; let the spectators become an entertainment to themselves;
make them actors
themselves. "14
6. All ideological theater, all cultural theater, all communicative,
interpretive (in the popular and not the Nietzschean sense, of course)
theater seeking to transmit a content, or to deliver a message (of

3 10

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

whatever nature: political, religious, psychological, metaphysical, etc.)
that would make a discourse's meaning intelligible for its listeners;75
a message that would not be totally exhausted in the act and present tense of
the stage, that would not coincide with the stage, that could be
repeated without it. Here we touch upon what seems to be the profound essence of Artaud's project, his historico-metaphysical decision.
Artaud wanted to erase repetition in general.'` For him, repetition was evil, and
one could doubtless organize an entire reading of his texts around this
center. Repetiton separates force, presence, and life from themselves.
This separation is the economical and calculating gesture of that which
defers itself in order to maintain itself, that which reserves expenditure
and surrenders to fear. This power of repetition governed everything that
Artaud wished to destroy, and it has several names: God, Being,
Dialectics. God is the eternity whose death goes on indefinitely, whose
death, as difference and repetition within life, has never ceased to
menace life. It is not the living God, but the Death-God that we should
fear. God is Death. "For even the infinite is dead, / infinite is the name of
a dead man / who is not dead" (84). As soon as there is repetition, God
is there, the present holds on to itself and reserves itself, that is to say,
eludes itself "The absolute is not a being and will never be one, for there
can be no being without a crime committed against myself, that is to say,
without taking from. me a being who wanted one day to be god when this
is not possible, God being able to manifest himself only all at once,
given that he manifests himself an infinite number of times during all
the times of eternity as the infinity of times and eternity, which creates
perpetuity" (September 1945). Another name of repetition: Being. Being
is the form in which the infinite diversity of the forms and forces of life
and death can indefinitely merge and be repeated in the word. For there
is no word, nor in general a sign, which is not constituted by the
possibility of repeating itself. A sign which does not repeat itself, which is
not already divided by repetition in its "first time," is not a sign. The
signifying referral therefore must be ideal-and ideality is but the assured
power of repetition-in order to refer to the same thing each time. This
is why Being is the key word of eternal repetition, the victory of God
and of Death over life. Like Nietzsche (for example in The Birth of
Philosophy), Artaud refuses to subsume Life to

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

311

Being, and inverses the genealogical order: "First to live and to be
according to one's soul; the problem of being is only their consequence" (September 1945) "There is no greater enemy of the human
body than being." (September 1947) Certain other unpublished texts
valorize what Artaud properly calls "the beyond of being" (February
1947), manipulating this expression of Plato's (whom Artaud did not fail
to read) in a Nietzschean style. Finally, Dialectics is the movement
through which expenditure is reappropriated into presence-it is the
economy of repetition. The economy of truth. Repetition summarizes
negativity, gathers and maintains the past present as truth, as ideality. The
truth is always that which can be repeated. Nonrepetition, expenditure
that is resolute and without return in the unique time consuming the
present, must put an end to fearful discursiveness, to unskirtable ontology,
to dialectics, "dialectics [a certain dialectics] being that which finished
me" (September 1945)."
Dialectics is always that which has finished us, because it is always that
which takes into account our rejection of it. As it does our affirmation. To reject
death as repetition is to affirm death as a present expenditure without
return. And inversely. This is a schema that hovers around Nietzsche's
repetition of affirmation. Pure expenditure, absolute generosity offering
the unicity of the present to death in order to make the
present appear as such, has already begun to want to maintain the presence
of the present, has already opened the book and memory, the
thinking of Being as memory. Not to want to maintain the present is to
want to preserve that which constitutes its irreplaceable and mortal
presence, that within it which cannot be repeated. To consume pure
difference with pleasure. Such, reduced to its bloodless framework,
is the matrix of the history of thought conceptualizing itself since
Hegel.18
The possibility of the theater is the obligatory focal point of this
thought which reflects tragedy as repetition. The menace of repetition is
nowhere else as well organized as in the theater. Nowhere else is one so
close to the stage as the origin of repetition, so close to the primitive
repetition which would have to be erased, and only by detaching it
from itself as if from its double. Not in the sense in which Artaud spoke
of The Theater and its Double," but as designating

312

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

the fold, the interior duplication which steals the simple presence of
its present act from the theater, from life, etc., in the irrepressible
movement of repetition. "One time" is the enigma of that which has
no meaning, no presence, no legibility. Now, for Artaud, the festival of
cruelty could take place only one time: "Let us leave textual criticism to
graduate students, formal criticism to esthetes, and recognize that what
has been said is not still to be said; that an expression does not have the
same value twice, does not live two lives; that all words, once spoken, are
dead and function only at the moment when they are uttered, that a
form, once it has served, cannot be used again and asks only to be
replaced by another, and that the theater is the only place in the world
where a gesture, once made, can never be made the same way twice"
(TD, p. 75). This is indeed how things appear: theatrical representation
is finite, and leaves behind it, behind its actual presence, no trace, no
object to carry off. It is neither a book nor a work, but an energy, and in
this sense it is the only art of life. "The theater teaches precisely the
uselessness of the action which, once done, is not to be done, and the
superior use of the state unused by the action and which, restored,
produces a purification" (TD, p. 82). In this sense the theater of cruelty
would be the art of difference and of expenditure without economy,
without reserve, without return, without history. Pure presence as pure
difference. Its act must be forgotten, actively forgotten. Here, one must
practice the aktive Vergesslichkeit which is spoken of in the second dissertation
of The Genealogy of Morals, which also explicates "festivity" and "cruelty"
(Grausomkeit).
Artaud's disgust with nontheatrical writing has the same sense.
What inspires this disgust is not, as in the Phaedrus, the gesture of the
body, the sensory and mnemonic, the hypomnesiac mark exterior to the
inscription of truth in the soul, but, on the contrary, writing as the site
of the inscription of truth, the other of the living body, writing as ideality,
repetition. Plato criticizes writing as a body; Artaud criticizes it as the
erasure of the body, of the living gesture which takes place only once.
Writing is space itself and the possibility of repetition in general. This is
why "We should get rid of our superstitious valuation of texts and
written poetry. Written poetry is worth reading once, and then
should be destroyed" (TD, p. 78).

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

313

In thus enumerating the themes of infidelity, one comes to understand
very quickly that fidelity is impossible. There is no theater in the world
today which fulfills Artaud's desire. And there would be no exception
to be made for the attempts made by Artaud himself He knew this
better than any other: the "grammar" of the theater of cruelty, of
which he said that it is "to be found," will always remain the
inaccessible limit of a representation which is not repetition, of a representation which is full presence, which does not carry its double
within itself as its death, of a present which does not repeat itself, that
is, of a present outside time, a nonpresent. The present offers itself as
such, appears, presents itself, opens the stage of time or the time of the
stage only by harboring its own intestine difference, and only in the
interior fold of its original repetition, in representation. In dialectics.
Artaud knew this well: "a certain dialectics For if one appropriately
conceives the horizon of dialectics-outside a conventional Hegelianism-one
understands, perhaps, that dialectics is the indefinite movement of
finitude, of the unity of life and death, of difference, of original
repetition, that is, of the origin of tragedy as the absence of a simple
origin. In this sense, dialectics is tragedy, the only possible affirmation
to be made against the philosophical or Christian idea of pure origin,
against "the spirit of beginnings": "But the spirit of beginnings has not
ceased to make me commit idiocies, and I have not ceased to dissociate
myself from the spirit of beginnings which is the Christian spirit"
(September 1945). What is tragic is not the impossibility but the
necessity of repetition.
Artaud knew that the theater of cruelty neither begins nor is completed within the purity of simple presence, but rather is already within
representation, in the "second time of Creation," in the conflict of
forces which could not be that of a simple origin. Doubtless, cruelty
could begin to be practiced within this conflict, but thereby it must also
let itself be penetrated. The origin is always penetrated. Such is the alchemy
of the theater.
Perhaps before proceeding further I shall be asked to define what I mean by
the archetypal, primitive theater. And we shall thereby

approach the very heart of the matter. If in fact we raise the question of
the origins and raison d'etre (or primordial necessity) of the theater, we
find, metaphysically, the materialization or rather the exteriorization
of a kind of essential drama, already disposed and divided, not so much as to
lose their character as principles, but enough to comprise, in a substantial
and active fashion (i.e. resonantly), an infinite perspective of conflicts. To
analyze such a drama philosophically is impossible; only poetically .... And
this essential drama, we come to realize, exists, and in the image of
something subtler than Creation itself, something which must be
represented as the result of one Will alone-and without conflict. We must
believe that the essential drama, the one at the root of all the Great
Mysteries, is associated with the second phase of Creation, that of difficulty
and of the Double, that of matter and the materialization of the idea. It
seems indeed that where simplicity and order reign, there can be no
theater nor drama, and the true theater, like poetry as well, though by other
means, is born out of a kind of organized anarchy [TD, pp. 5o-5t].
Primitive theater and cruelty thus also begin by repetition. But if the idea
of a theater without representation, the idea of the impossible, does not
help us to regulate theatrical practice, it does, perhaps, permit us to
conceive its origin, eve and limit, and the horizon of its death. The
energy of Western theater thus lets itself be encompassed within its own
possibility, which is not accidental and serves as a constitutive center
and structuring locus for the entire history of the West. But repetition
steals the center and the locus, and what we have just said of its
possibility should prohibit us from speaking both of death as a horizon
and of birth as a past opening.
Artaud kept himself as close as possible to the limit: the possibility
and impossibility of pure theater. Presence, in order to be presence and
self-presence, has always already begun to represent itself, has always
already been penetrated. Affirmation itself must be penetrated in repeating
itself Which means that the murder of the father which opens the history
of representation and the space of tragedy, the murder of the father that
Artaud, in sum, wants to repeat at the greatest proximity to its origin but
only a single time-this murder is endless and is repeated indefinitely. It
begins by penetrating its own commentary

THE THEATER OF CRUELTY

315

and is accompanied by its own representation. In which it erases itself and
confirms the transgressed law. To do so, it suffices that there be a sign, that
is to say, a repetition.
Underneath this side of the limit, and in the extent to which he
wanted to save the purity of a presence without interior difference and
without repetition (or, paradoxically amounting to the same thing, the
purity of a pure difference), 20 Artaud also desired the impossibility of the
theater, wanted to erase the stage, no longer wanted to see what
transpires in a locality always inhabited or haunted by the father and
subjected to the repetition of murder. Is it not Artaud who wants to
reduce the archi-stage when he writes in the Here-lies: "I Antonin Artaud,
am my son, / my father, my mother, / and myself' (AA, p. 238)?
That he thereby kept himself at the limit of theatrical possibility, and
that he simultaneously wanted to produce and to annihilate the stage, is
what he knew in the most extreme way. December 1946:
And now I am going to say something which, perhaps, is
going to stupify many people. I am the enemy
of theater.
I have always been.
As much as I love the theater,
I am, for this very reason, equally its enemy.
We see him immediately afterward: he cannot resign himself to theater as
repetition, and cannot renounce theater as nonrepetition:
The theater is a passionate overflowing a
frightful transfer of forces
from body
to body.
This transfer cannot be reproduced twice.
Nothing more impious than the system of the Balinese which
consists,
after having produced this transfer one time,
instead of seeking another,

3 16 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
in resorting to a system of particular enchantments
in order to deprive astral photography of the gestures thus obtained.
Theater as repetition of that which does not repeat itself, theater as
the original repetition of difference within the conflict of forces in
which "evil is the permanent law, and what is good is an effort and
already a cruelty added to the other cruelty"-such is the fatal limit of a
cruelty which begins with its own representation.
Because it has always already begun, representation therefore has no
end. But one can conceive of the closure of that which is without end.
Closure is the circular limit within which the repetition of difference
infinitely repeats itself That is to say, closure is its playing space. This
movement is the movement of the world as play. "And for the absolute life
itself is a game" (OC 4:282) This play is cruelty as the unity of
necessity and chance. "It is chance that is infinite, not god"
(Fragmentations). This play of life is artistic."
To think the closure of representation is thus to think the cruel
powers of death and play which permit presence to be born to itself,
and pleasurably to consmne itself through the representation in which it
eludes itself in its deferral, To think the closure of representation is to think
the tragic: not as the representation of fate, but as the fate of
representation. Its gratuitous and baseless necessity.
And it is to think why it is fatal that, in its closure, representation
continues.

A Hegelianism without reserve

He [Hegell] did not know to what extent he was right. . (Georges
Bataille)
"Often Hegel seems to me self-evident, but the self-evident is a heavy
burden" (Le coupable). Why today-even today-are the best readers of
Bataille among those for whom Hegel's self evidence is so lightly
borne? So lightly borne that a murmured allusion to given fundamental concepts-the pretext, sometimes, for avoiding the details-or a
complacent conventionality, a blindness to the text, an invocation of
Bataille's complicity with Nietzsche or Marx, suffice to undo the constraint of Hegel. Perhaps the self-evident would be too heavy to bear, and
so a shrug of the shoulders is preferred to discipline. And, contrary to
Bataille's experience, this puts one, without seeing or knowing it, within
the very self-evidence of Hegel one often thinks oneself unburdened of.
Misconstrued, treated lightly, Hegelianism only extends its historical
domination, finally unfolding its immense enveloping

318

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

resources without obstacle. Hegelian self-evidence seems lighter than ever
at the moment when it finally bears down with its full weight. Bataille
had feared this too: heavy, "it will be even more so in the future." And
if Bataille considered himself closer to Nietzsche than anyone else, than
to anyone else, to the point of identification with him, it was not, in this
case, as a motive for simplification:
Nietzsche knew o f Hegel only the usual vulgarization. The Genealogy of
Morals is the singular proof o f the state o f general ignorance in which
remained, and remains today, the dialectic o f the master and the slave,
whose lucidity is blinding.... no one knows anything of h imself if he
has not grasped this movement which determines and limits the successive
possibilities o f man [L'experience interieure (hereafter El), p. 140, n. I ] .

To bear the self-evidence of Hegel, today, would mean this: one must, in
every sense, go through the "slumber of reason," the slumber that
engenders monsters and then puts them to sleep; this slumber must be
effectively traversed so that awakening will not be a ruse of dream. That is to
say, again, a ruse of reason. The slumber of reason is not, perhaps, reason
put to sleep, but slumber in the form of reason, the vigilance of the
Hegelian logos. Reason keeps watch over a deep slumber in which it has an
interest. Now, if "evidence received in the slumber of reason loses or will
lose the characteristics of wakefulness" (ibid.), then it is necessary, in
order to open our eyes (and did Bataille ever want to do otherwise,
correctly certain that he was thereby risking death: "the condition in
which I would see would be to die"), to have spent the night with reason,
to have kept watch and to have slept with her: and to have done so
throughout the night, until morning, until the other dawn which
resembles, even to the point of being taken for it-like daybreak for
nightfall-the hour when the philosophical animal can also finally open
its eyes. That morning and none other. For at the far reaches of this night
something was contrived, blindly, I mean in a discourse, by means of
which philosophy, in completing itself, could both include within itself
and anticipate all the figures of its beyond, all the forms and resources
of its exterior; and could do so in order to keep these forms and
resources close to itself by simply taking

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY

319

hold of their enunciation. Except, perhaps, for a certain laughter. And yet.
To laugh at philosophy (at Hegelianism)-such, in effect, is the form
of the awakening-henceforth calls for an entire "discipline," an entire
"method of meditation" that acknowledges the philosopher's byways,
understands his techniques, makes use of his ruses, manipulates his cards,
lets him deploy his strategy, appropriates his texts. Then, thanks to this
work which has prepared it-and philosophy is work itself according to
Bataille-but quickly, furtively, and unforeseeably breaking with it, as
betrayal or as detachment, drily, laughter bursts out. And yet, in privileged
moments that are less moments than the always rapidly sketched
movements of experience; rare, discreet and light movements, without
triumphant stupidity, far from public view, very close to that at which
laughter laughs: close to anguish, first of all, which must not even be called
the negative of laughter for fear of once more being sucked in by Hegel's
discourse. And one can already foresee, in this prelude, that the impossible
meditated by Bataille will always have this form: how, after having
exhausted the discourse of philosophy, can one inscribe in the lexicon
and syntax of a language, our language, which was also the language of
philosophy, that which nevertheless exceeds the oppositions of
concepts governed by this communal logic? Necessary and impossible,
this excess had to fold discourse into strange shapes. And, of course,
constrain it to justify itself to Hegel indefinitely. Since more than a
century of ruptures, of "surpassings" with or without "overturnings,"
rarely has a relation to Hegel been so little definable: a complicity without
reserve accompanies Hegelian discourse, "takes it seriously" up to the
end, without an objection in philosophical form, while, however, a
certain burst of laughter exceeds it and destroys its sense, or signals, in
any event, the extreme point of "experience" which makes Hegelian
discourse dislocate itself; and this can be done only through close scrutiny
and full knowledge of what one is laughing at.
Bataille, thus, took Hegel seriously, and took absolute knowledge
seriously.' And to take such a system seriously, Bataille knew, was to
prohibit oneself from extracting concepts from it, or from manipulating
isolated propositions, drawing effects from them by transportation into a
discourse foreign to them: "Hegel's thoughts are interdependent

3 20

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

to the point of it being impossible to grasp their meaning, if not in the
necessity of the movement which constitutes their coherence" (El, p. 193).
Bataille doubtless put into question the idea or meaning of the chain in
Hegelian reason, but did so by thinking the chain as such, in its totality,
without ignoring its internal rigor. One could describe as a scene, but we
will not do so here, the history of Bataille's relations to Hegel's different
faces: the one that assumed "absolute rending";' the one who "thought
he would go mad";' the one who, between Wolff and Comte and "the
clouds of professors" at the "village wedding" that is philosophy, asks
himself no questions, while "alone, his head aching, Kierkegaard
questions";' the one who "towards the end of his life," "no longer put
the problem to himself," "repeated his courses and played cards;" the
"portrait of the aged Hegel" before which, as "in reading the
Phenomenology of the Mind," "one cannot help being seized by freezing
impression of completion."5 Finally, the Hegel of the "small comic
recapitulation."6
But let us leave the stage and the players. The drama is first of all
textual. In his interminable explication with Hegel, Bataille doubtless had
only a restricted and indirect access to the texts themselves.' This did not
prevent him from bringing his reading and his question to bear on the
crucial point of the decision. Taken one by one and immobilized outside
their syntax, all of Bataille's concepts are Hegelian. We must
acknowledge this without stopping here. For if one does not grasp the
rigorous effect of the trembling to which he submits these concepts,
the new configuration into which he displaces and reinscribes them,
barely reaching it however, one would conclude, according to the case at
hand, that Bataille is Hegelian or anti-Hegelian, or that he has muddled
Hegel. One would be deceived each time. And one would miss the formal
law which, necessarily enunciated by Bataille in a nonphilosophical
mode, has constrained the relationship of all his concepts to those of
Hegel, and through Hegel's concepts to the concepts of the entire history
of metaphysics. All of Bataille's concepts, and not only those to which we
must limit ourselves here, in order to reconstitute

the enunciation of this law.

The epoch of meaning: lordship and sovereignty
To begin with, does not sovereignty, at first glance, translate the lordship
(Herrschaft) of the Phenomenology?' The operation of lordship indeed consists in,
writes Hegel, "showing that it is fettered to determinate existence, that it
is not bound at all by the particularity everywhere characteristic of
existence as such, and is not tied up with life" (Hegel, p. 232). Such an
"operation" (this word, constantly employed by Bataille to designate
the privileged moment or the act of sovereignty, was the current
translation of the word Tun, which occurs so frequently in the chapter on
the dialectic of the master and the slave) thus amounts to risking, putting at
stake (mettre en jea, wagen, daransetzen; mettre en jeu is one of Bataille's most
fundamental and frequently used expressions) the entirety of one's own
life. The servant is the man who does not put his life at stake, the man
who wants to conserve his life, wants to be conserved (servus). By raising
oneself above life, by looking at death directly, one acceeds to lordship: to the
for-itself [pour soi, fur sich], to freedom, to recognition. Freedom must go
through the putting at stake of life (Daransetzen des Lebens). The lord is the
man who has had the strength to endure the anguish of death and to
maintain the work of death. Such, according to Bataille, is the center of
Hegelianism. The "principal text" would be the one, in the Preface to the
Phenomenology, which places knowledge "at the height of death."9
The rigorous and subtle corridors through which the dialectic of
master and slave passes are well known. They cannot be summarized
without being mistreated. We are interested, here, in the essential displacements to which they are submitted as they are reflected in
Bataille's thought. And we are interested, first of all, in the difference
between lordship and sovereignty. It cannot even be said that this
difference has a sense: it is the difference of sense, the unique interval which
separates meaning from a certain non-meaning. Lordship has a meaning.
The putting at stake of life is a moment in the constitution of
meaning, in the presentation of essence and truth. It is an obligatory
stage in the history of self-consciousness and phenomenality, that is to
say, in the presentation of meaning. For history-that is, meaning-to
form a continuous chain, to be woven, the master must experience his truth.
This is possible only under two conditions which cannot be

3 22

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

separated: the master must stay alive in order to enjoy what he has won
by risking his life; and, at the end of this progression so admirably
described by Hegel, the "truth of the independent consciousness is
accordingly the consciousness of the bondsman" (Hegel, p. 237). And
when servility becomes lordship, it keeps within it the trace of its repressed
origin, "being a consciousness within itself (zuruckgedrungtes Bewusstsein),
it will enter into itself, and change round into real and true independence"
(ibid.). It is this dissymmetry, this absolute privilege given to the slave,
that Bataille did not cease to meditate. The truth of the master is in the
slave; and the slave become a master remains a "repressed" slave.
Such is the condition of meaning, of history of discourse, of
philosophy, etc. The master is in relation to himself, and selfconsciousness is constituted, only through the mediation of servile
consciousness in the movement of recognition; but simultaneously
through the mediation of the thing, which for the slave is initially the
essentiality that he cannot immediately negate in pleasurable consumption,
but can only work upon, "elaborate" (bearbeiten); which consists in
inhibiting (hemmen) his desire, in delaying (aufhalten) the disappearance
of the thing. To stay alive, to maintain oneself in life, to work, to defer
pleasure, to limit the stakes, to have respect for death at the very moment
when one looks directly at it-such is the servile condition of mastery and of
the entire history it makes possible.
Hegel clearly had proclaimed the necessity of the master's retaining the
life that he exposes to risk. Without this economy of life, the "trial by
death, however, cancels both the truth which was to result from it, and
therewith the certainty of self altogether" (Hegel, p. 233). To rush
headlong into death pure and simple is thus to risk the absolute loss of
meaning, in the extent to which meaning necessarily traverses the truth of
the master and of self-consciousness. One risks losing the effect and profit
of meaning which were the very stakes one hoped to win. Hegel called this
mute and nonproductive death, this death pure and simple, abstract
negativity, in opposition to "the negation characteristic of consciousness, which
cancels in such a way that it preserves and maintains what is sublated (Die
Negation des Bewusstseins welches so aufhebt, doss es das Aufgehobene aufbewahrt
and erhalt), and thereby survives its being sublated (und hiermit sent
Aufgehobenwerden uberlebt). In this experience

h

self-consciousness becomes aware that life is as essential to it as pure
self-consciousness" (Hegel, p. 234).
Burst of laughter from Bataille. Through a ruse of life, that is, of
reason, life has thus stayed alive. Another concept of life had been
surreptitiously put in its place, to remain there, never to be exceeded, any
more than reason is ever exceeded (for, says L'erotisme, "by definition, the
excess is outside reason"). This life is not natural life, the biological
existence put at stake in lordship, but an essential life that is welded to the
first one, holding it back, making it work for the constitution of selfconsciousness, truth, and meaning. Such is the truth of life. Through this
recourse to the Aufhebung, which conserves the stakes, remains in control of
the play, limiting it and elaborating it by giving it form and meaning (Die
Arbeit ... bildet), this economy of life restricts itself to conservation, to
circulation and self-reproduction as the reproduction of meaning;
henceforth, everything covered by the name lordship collapses into
comedy. The independence of self-consciousness 10 becomes laughable at
the moment when it liberates itself by enslaving itself, when it starts to
work, that is, when it enters into dialectics. Laughter alone exceeds
dialectics and the dialectician: it bursts out only on the basis of an absolute
renunciation of meaning, an absolute risking of death, what Hegel calls
abstract negativity. A negativity that never takes place, that never presents
itself, because in doing so it would start to work again. A laughter that literally
never appears, because it exceeds phenomenality in general, the absolute
possibility of meaning. And the word "laughter" itself must be read in a
burst, as its nucleus of meaning bursts in the direction of the system of
the sovereign operation ("drunkenness, erotic effusion, sacrificial
effusion, poetic effusion, heroic behavior, anger, absurdity," etc., cf.
Methode de meditation). This burst of laughter makes the difference
between lordship and sovereignty shine, without showing it however and,
above all, without saying it. Sovereignty, as we shall verify, is more and less
than lordship, more or less free than it, for example; and what we are
saying about the predicate "freedom" can be extended to every
characteristic of lordship. Simultaneously more and less a lordship than
lordship, sovereignty is totally other. Bataille pulls it out of dialectics. He
withdraws it from the horizon of meaning and knowledge. And does so
to such a
degree that, despite the characteristics that make it resemble lordship,

324

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

sovereignty is no longer a figure in the continuous chain of phenomenology. Resembling a phenomenological figure, trait for trait, sovereignty is the absolute alteration of all of them. And this difference
would not be produced if the analogy was limited to a given abstract
characteristic. Far from being an abstract negativity, sovereignty (the
absolute degree of putting at stake), rather, must make the seriousness of
meaning appear as an abstraction inscribed in play. Laughter, which
constitutes sovereignty in its relation to death, is not a negativity, as has
been said.'' And it laughs at itself, a "major" laughter laughs at a
"minor" laughter, for the sovereign operation also needs life-the life
that welds the two lives together in order to be in relation to itself in the
pleasurable consumption of itself Thus, it must simulate, after a
fashion, the absolute risk, and it must laugh at this simulacrum. In the
comedy that it thereby plays for itself, the burst of laughter is th
almost-nothing into which meaning sinks, absolutely. "Philosophy,"
should have "considered laughter first" (ibid.). This is why laughter is
absent from the Hegelian system, and not in the manner of a negative or
abstract side of it. "In the 'system' poetry, laughter, ecstasy are
nothing. Hegel hastily gets rid of them: he knows no other aim than
knowledge. To my eyes, his immense fatigue is linked to his horror of
the blind spot" (El, p. 142). What is laughable is the submission to the selfevidence of meaning, to the force of this imperative: that there;;
must be meaning, that nothing must be definitely lost in death, or
further, that death should receive the signification of "abstract negativ
ity," that a work must always be possible which, because it defers
enjoyment, confers meaning, seriousness, and truth upon the "putting
at stake." This submission is the essence and element of philosophy, of
Hegelian ontologics. Absolute comicalness is the anguish experienced
fice of meaning: a sacrifice without return and without reserves. The
notion of Aufhebung (the speculative concept par excellence, says Hegel,
the concept whose untranslatable privilege is wielded by the German
language)" is laughable in that it signifies the busying of a discourse
losing its breath as it reappropriates all negativity for itself, as it
works the "putting at stake" into an investment, as it amortizes absolute
expenditure; and as it gives meaning to death, thereby simultaneously;

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY 325

blinding itself to the baselessness of the nonmeaning from which the
basis of meaning is drawn, and in which this basis of meaning is
exhausted. To be indifferent to the comedy of the Aufhebung, as was
Hegel, is to blind oneself to the experience of the sacred, to the heedless
sacrifice of presence and meaning. Thus is sketched out a figure of
experience-but can one still use these two words?-irreducible to any
phenomenology, a figure which finds itself displaced in phenomenology,
like laughter in philosophy of the mind, and which mimes through
sacrifice the absolute risk of death. Through this mime it
simultaneously produces the risk of absolute death, the feint through
which this risk can be lived, the impossibility of reading a sense or a
truth in it, and the laughter which is confused, in the simulacrum, with the
opening of the sacred. Describing this simulacrum, unthinkable for
philosophy, philosophy's blind spot, Bataille must, of course, say it,
feign to say it, in the Hegelian logos:
I will speak later about the profound differences between the man of
sacrifice, who operates ignorant (unconscious) of the ramifications of
what he is doing, and the Sage (Hegel), who surrenders to a knowledge
that, in his own eyes, is absolute. Despite these differences, it is always a
question of manifesting the Negative (and always in a concrete form,
that is, at the heart of the Totality whose constitutive elements are
inseparable). The privileged manifestation of Negativity is death, but
death, in truth, reveals nothing. In principle, death reveals to Man his
natural, animal being, but the revelation never takes place. For once the
animal being that has supported him is dead, the human being himself has
ceased to exist. For man finally to be revealed to himself he would have to
die, but he would have to do so while living-while watching himself cease to
be. In other words, death itself would have to become (self) consciousness
at the very moment when it annihilates conscious being. In a sense this is
what takes place (or at least is on the point of taking place, or which takes
place in a fugitive, ungraspable manner) by means of a subterfuge. In
sacrifice, the sacrificer identifies with the animal struck by death. Thus he
dies while watching himself die, and even, after a fashion, dies of his
own volition, as one with the sacrificial arm. But this is a comedy! Or at
least it would be a comedy if there were some other method of revealing
the

326 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

encroachment of death upon the living; this completion of the finite
being, which alone accomplishes and can alone accomplish his Negativity
which kills him, finishes him and definitively suppresses him.... Thus it is

Hegel, wanting to make the opposition between them emerge as clearly

his gaiety is not part of the economy of life, does not correspond "to
the desire to deny the existence of death," although it is as close to this
desire as possible. Gaiety is not the convulsion that follows anguish, the
minor laugh which melts away at the moment when one has had "a
dose call," and which is in relation to anguish along the lines of the
relationship of positive to negative:
On the contrary, gaiety, tied to the work of death, fills me with anguish, is
accentuated by an anguish and, in exchange, exasperates this anguish:
finally, gay anguish, anguished gaiety present me with "absolute rending"
in an aspic in which it is my joy that finally rends me asunder, but in

Now, Bataille does not take the negative seriously. But he must mark his

example, the passage through the certitude of oneself and through

pursue logic to the point at which, within discourse, the Aufhebung (discourse itself)
makes logic collaborate with the constitution and interiorizing memory of
meaning, with Erinnerung. On the contrary, it is convulsively to tear apart
the negative side, that which makes it the reassuring other surface of
the positive; and it is to exhibit within the negative, in an instant, that
which can no longer be called negative. And can no longer be called negative
precisely because it has no reserved underside; because it can no longer
permit itself to be converted into positivity, because it can no longer
collaborate with the continuous linking-up of meaning, concept, time and
truth in discourse; because it literally can no longer labor and let itself be
interrogated as the "work of the negative." Hegel saw this without seeing
it, showed it while concealing it. Thus, he must be followed to the end,

repetition a barely perceptible displacement disjoints all the articulations
and penetrates all the points welded together by the imitated discourse.
A trembling spreads out which then makes the entire old
shell crack.
In effect, if Hegel's attitude opposes scientific consciousness and an endless
ordering of discursive thought to the naivete of sacrifice, this consciousness
and this ordering still have a point of obscurity: it could not be said that
Hegel misconstrued the "moment" of sacrifice: this "moment" is included,
implied in the entire movement of the Phenomenology, in which it is the
Negativity of death, insofar as man assumes it, that makes a man of the
human animal. But not having seen that sacrifice by itself bore witness to
the entire movement of death, the Preface to the Phenomenology was first of
all initial and u n i v e r s a l - h e did not know to what extent he was right-with
what exactitude he described the movement of Negativity [Hegel, la mort,
PP. 35-36].

without reserve, to the point of agreeing with him against himself and of
wresting his discovery from the too conscientious interpretation he gave of it.

element, its milieu, its unlimiting boundaries of non-sense. Far from
suppressing the dialectical synthesis, 16 it inscribes this synthesis and
makes it function within the sacrifice of meaning. It does not suffice to
risk death if the putting at stake is not permitted to take off, as chance or
accident, but is rather invested as the work of the negative. Sovereignty
must still sacrifice lordship and, thus, the presentation of the meaning of
death. For meaning, when lost to discourse, is absolutely destroyed and
consumed. For the meaning of meaning, the dialectic of the senses and
sense, of the sensory and the concept, the meaningful unity of the word
"sense," to which Hegel was so attentive," has always been linked to
the possibility of discursive signification. In sacrificing meaning,
sovereignty submerges the possibility of discourse: not sim

ply by means of an interruption, a caesura, or an interior wounding of
discourse (an abstract negativity), but, through such an opening, by
means of an irruption suddenly uncovering the limit of discourse and the
beyond of absolute knowledge.
To be sure, Bataille sometimes opposes poetic, ecstatic sacred speech to
"significative discourse" ("But intelligence, the discursive thought of Man,
developed as a function of servile work. Only sacred, poetic
speech, limited to the level of impotent beauty, kept the power o
manifesting full sovereignty. Sacrifice is a sovereign, autonomous way of being
only in the extent to which it is not informed by significative discourse."
Hegel, la mort, p. 40), but this sovereign speech is not another discourse,
another chain unwound alongside significative discourse. There is only
one discourse, it is significative, and here one cannot get around Hegel. The
poetic or the ecstatic is that in every discourse which can open itself up to the
absolute loss of its sense, to the (non-)base of the sacred, of nonmeaning,
of un-knowledge or of play, to the swoon from which it is reawakened
by a throw of the dice. What is poetic in sovereignty is announced
in "the moment when poetry renounces theme and meaning" (El, p.
239). It is only announced in this renunciation, for, given over to "play
without rules," poetry risks letting itself be domesticated, "subordinated,"
better than ever. This risk is properly modern. To avoid it, poetry must be
"accompanied by an affirmation of sovereignty" "which provides," Bataille
says in an admirable, untenable formulation which could serve as the
heading for everything we are attempting to reassemble here as the
form and torment of his

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY

331

writing, "the commentary on its absence of meaning." Without which
poetry would be, in the worst of cases, subordinated and, in the best of cases,
"inserted." For then, "laughter, drunkenness, sacrifice and poetry,
eroticism itself, subsist autonomously, in a reserve, inserted into a sphere, like
children in a house. Within their limits they are minor sovereigns who
cannot contest the empire of activity" (ibid.). It is within the interval
between subordination, insertion, and sovereignty that one should examine the
relations between literature and revolution, such as Bataille conceived
them in the course of his explication with Surrealism. The apparent
ambiguity of his judgments on poetry is included within the configuration of these three concepts. The poetic image is not subordinated to the
extent that it "leads from the known to the unknown;" but poetry is
almost entirely fallen poetry in that it retains, in order to maintain itself
within them, the metaphors that it has certainly torn from the "servile
domain," but has immediately "refused to the inner ruination which is the
access to the unknown." "It is unfortunate to possess no more than ruins,
but this is not any longer to possess nothing; it is to keep in one hand
what the other gives."" An operation that is still Hegelian.
As a manifestation of meaning, discourse is thus the loss of sovereignty itself Servility is therefore only the desire for meaning: a proposition
with which the history of philosophy is confused; a proposition that
determines work as the meaning of meaning, and techne as the
unfolding of truth; a proposition powerfully reassembled in the Hegelian
moment, and a proposition that Batailie, in the wake of Nietzsche, wanted
to bring to the point of enunciation, and whose denunciation he wished
to wrest from the non-basis of an inconceivable nonsense, finally
placing it within major play. The minor play consisting in still
attributing a meaning, within discourse, to the absence of meaning."

The two forms of writing
These judgments should lead to silence yet I write. This is not
paradoxical
(El, p. 89)
But we must speak. "The inadequation of all speech ... at least, must be
said,"" in order to maintain sovereignty, which is to say, after a

I

332

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

fashion, in order to lose it, in order still to reserve the possibility not o its
meaning but of its nonmeaning; in order to distinguish it, through this
impossible "commentary," from all negativity. We must find a speech
which maintains silence. Necessity of the impossible: to say in languagethe language of servility-that which is not servile. "That which is not
servile is unspeakable.... The idea of silence (which is the
inaccessible) is disarming! I cannot speak of an absence of meaning,
except by giving it a meaning it does not have. Silence is broken
because I have spoken. Some lamma sabachtani always ends history, and
cries out our total inability to keep still: I must give a meaning to that which
does not have one: in the end, being is given to us as impossible" (El,
p. 215). If the word silence "among all words," is "the most perverse or
the most poetic," it is because in pretending to silence meaning, it
says nonmeaning, it slides and it erases itself, does not maintain
itself, silences itself, not as silence, but as speech. This sliding
simultaneously betrays discourse and nondiscourse. It can be imposed
upon us, but sovereignty can also play upon it in order rigorously to
betray the meaning within meaning, the discourse within discourse. "We
must find," Bataille explains to us, in choosing "silence" as "an example
of a sliding word," "words" and "objects" which "make us slide" ...
(El, p. 29). Toward what? Toward other words, other objects, of course,
which announce sovereignty.
This sliding is risky. But since it has this orientation, what it risks is
meaning and the loss of sovereignty in the figure of discourse. It risks
making sense, risks agreeing to the reasonableness of reason, of philosophy, of
Hegel, who is always right, as soon as one opens one's mouth in order
to articulate meaning. In order to run this risk within language, in
order to save that which does not want to be saved-the possibility of
play and of absolute risk-we must redouble language and have
recourse to ruses, to stratagems, to simulacra." To masks: "That which is
not servile is unspeakable: a reason for laughing, for ... : the same holds for
ecstasy. Whatever is not useful must be hidden (under a mask)" (El, p.
214). In speaking "at the limit of silence," we must organize a strategy
and "find [words] which reintroduce-at a point the sovereign silence
which interrupts articulated language."
Since it excludes articulated language, sovereign silence is therefore,

in a certain fashion, foreign to difference as the source of signification. It

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY

333

seems to erase discontinuity, and this is how we must, in effect, understand
the necessity of the continuum which Bataille unceasingly invokes, just as he
does communication." The continuum is the privileged experience of a sovereign
operation transgressing the limit of discursive difference. But-and here we
are touching upon, as concerns the movement of sovereignty, the point
of greatest ambiguity and greatest instabilitythis continuum is not the
plenitude of meaning or of presence, as this plenitude is envisaged by
metaphysics. Pushing itself toward the nonbasis of negativity and of
expenditure, the experience of the continuum is also the experience of
absolute difference, of a difference which would no longer be the one
that Hegel had conceived more profoundly than anyone else: the
difference in the service of presence, at work for (the) history (of meaning).
The difference between Hegel and Bataille is the difference between these
two differences. This enables one to dispel the equivocality which might
weigh upon the concepts of communication, continuum, or instant. These concepts,
which seem to be identical to each other like the accomplishing of presence, in
fact mark and sharpen the incision of difference. "A fundamental principle
is expressed as follows: 'communication' cannot take place from one full
and intact being to another: it requires beings who have put the being
within themselves at stake, have placed it at the limit of death, of nothingness"
(Sur Nietzsche). And the instant-the temporal mode of the sovereign
operation-is not a point of full and unpenetrated presence: it slides and eludes
us between two presences; it is difference as the affirmative elusion of
presence. It does not give itself but is stolen, carries itself off in a movement
which is simultaneously one of violent effraction and of vanishing flight.
The instant is the furtive: "Un-knowledge implies at once fundamentally
anguish, but also the suppression of anguish. Henceforth, it becomes
possible furtively to undergo the furtive experience that I call the
experience of the instant" (Conferences sur le Non-savoir).
Words, therefore, we must "find which reintroduce-at a pointthe
sovereign silence which interrupts articulated language." Since it is a certain
sliding that is in question, as we have seen, what must be found, no less than
the word, is the point, the place in a pattern at which a word drawn from the
old language will start, by virtue of having been placed there and by virtue
of having received such an impulsion, to slide and to make the entire
discourse slide. A certain strategic twist must be

334

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

imprinted upon language; and this strategic twist, with a violent and
sliding, furtive, movement must inflect the old corpus in order to relate its
syntax and its lexicon to major silence. And to the privileged moment
of the sovereign operation, "even if it took place only once," rather than to
the concept or meaning of sovereignty.
An absolutely unique relation: of a language to a sovereign silence which
tolerates no relations, tolerates no symmetry with that which tilts itself and slides
in order to be related to it. A relation, however, which must rigorously,
scientifically, place into a common syntax both the subordinated significations
and the operation which is nonrelation, which has no signification and
freely keeps itself outside syntax. Relations must scientifically be related
to nonrelations, knowledge to unknowledge. "The sovereign operation,
even if it were possible only once, the science relating objects of thought
to sovereign moments is possible" (Methode de meditation). "Henceforth, an
ordered reflection, founded on the abandoning of knowledge, begins"
(Conferences).
This will be even more difficult, if not impossible, in that sovereignty, since it is not lordship, cannot govern this scientific discourse in
the manner of a founding basis or a principle of responsibility. Like
lordship, sovereignty certainly makes itself independent through the
putting at stake of life; it is attached to nothing and conserves nothing. But,
differing from Hegelian lordship, it does not even want to maintain itself,
collect itself, or collect the profits from itself or from its own risk; it
"cannot even be defined as a possession." "I hold to it, but would I
hold to it as much if I was not certain that I could just as well laugh at it?"
(Methode de meditation). At stake in the operation, therefore, is not a selfconsciousness, an ability to be near oneself, to maintain and to watch
oneself We are not in the element of phenomenology. And this can be
recognized in the primary characteristic-illegible within philosophical
logic-that sovereignty does not govern itself. And does not govern in general:
it governs neither others, nor things, nor discourses in order to produce
meaning. This is the first obstacle in the way of this science which, according
to Bataille, must relate its objects to sovereign moments and which, like
every science, requires order, relatedness and the difference between the
original and the derivative. The Methode de meditation does not hide the
"obstacle" (the expression is Bataille's):
"Not only is the sovereign operation not subordinate to anything, but it

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY

335

makes nothing subordinate to itself, is indifferent to any possible
results; if afterward I wish to pursue the reduction of subordinate
thought to sovereign thought, I may do so, but whatever is authentically
sovereign is not concerned with this, and at every moment disposes of
me otherwise" (p. 283).
Once sovereignty has to attempt to make someone or something
subordinate to itself, we know that it would be retaken by dialectics,
would be subordinate to the slave, to the thing and to work, It would fail
for having wanted to be victorious, and for having alleged that it kept
the upper hand. Lordship, on the contrary, becomes sovereign when it
ceases to fear failure and is lost as the absolute victim of its own sacrifice."
Master and sovereign thus fail equally,24 and both succeed in their failure,
the one by giving it meaning through subjugation to the mediation of
the slave-which is also to fail for having lost failureand the other by
failing absolutely, which is simultaneously to lose the very meaning of
failure by gaining nonservility. This almost imperceptible difference,
which is not even the symmetry of an upper and a lower side, should
regulate all the "slidings" of sovereign writing. It should cut into the
identity of sovereignty which is always in question. For sovereignty has no
identity, is not self, for itself, toward itself, near itself In order not to govern,
that is to say, in order not to be subjugated, it must subordinate nothing
(direct object), that is to say, be subordinated to nothing or no one
(servile mediation of the indirect object): it must expend itself without
reserve, lose itself, lose consciousness, lose all memory of itself and all the
interiority of itself; as opposed to Erinnerung, as opposed to the avarice
which assimilates meaning, it must practice forgetting, the aktive Vergesslichkeit
of which Nietzsche speaks; and, as the ultimate subversion of lordship, it
must no longer seek to be recognized."
The renunciation of recognition simultaneously prescribes and prohibits
writing. Or rather, discerns two forms of writing. It forbids the form that
projects the trace, and through which, as the writing of lordship, the will
seeks to maintain itself within the trace, seeks to be recognized within
it and to reconstitute the presence of itself This is servile writing as well;
Bataille, therefore, scorned it. But this scorned servility of writing is not the
servility condemned by tradition since Plato. The latter has in mind servile
writing as an irresponsible techne,

I

because the presence of the person who pronounced discourse has
disappeared within it." Bataille, on the contrary, has in mind the servile
project of serving life-the phantom of life-in presence. In both cases,
it is true, a certain death is feared, and this complicity demands
consideration. The problem is even more difficult in that sovereignty
simultaneously assigns itself another form of writing: the one that
produces the trace as trace. This latter is a trace only if presence is
irremediably eluded in it, from its initial promise, and only if it constitutes
itself as the possibility of absolute erasure. An unerasable trace is not a
trace. We would thus have to reconstruct the system of Bataille's propositions on
writing, his propositions on these two relations-let us call them minor and
major-to the trace.
1. In one whole group of texts, the sovereign renunciation of
recognition enjoins the erasure of the written text. For example, the
erasure of poetic writing as minor writing:
This sacrifice of reason is apparently imaginary, it has neither a bloody
consequence, nor anything analogous. It nevertheless differs from poetry in
that it is total, holds back no enjoyment, except through arbitrary sliding,
which cannot be maintained, or through abandoned laughter. If it leaves
behind a chance survivor, it does so unbeknownst to itself, like the flower of
the fields after the harvest. This strange sacrifice which supposes an
advanced state of megalomania-we feel ourselves become Godnonetheless has ordinary consequences in one case: if enjoyment is
concealed by sliding, and megalomania is not entirely consumed, we
remain condemned to make ourselves "recognized," to want to be a God
for the crowd; a condition favorable to madness, but to nothing else.... If
one goes to the end, one must erase oneself, undergo solitude, suffer
harshly from it, renounce being recognized: one must be there as if absent,
deranged, and submit without will or hope, being elsewhere. Thought
(because of what it has at its base) must be buried alive. I publish this
knowing it misconstrued in advance, necessarily so.... I can do nothing, and it
along with me, but sink into non-sense to this degree. Thought ruins, and
its destruction is incommunicable to the crowd; it is addressed to
the least weak [El, p. 199].

The sovereign operation engages these developments: they are the
residues both of a trace left in memory and of the subsistence of functions;
but to the extent that it occurs, the sovereign operation is indifferent,
and defies these residues [El, p. 235].
or, further:
The survival of that which is written is the survival of the mummy [Le
coupable p. 1461
2. But there is a sovereign form of writing which, on the contrary,
must interrupt the servile complicity of speech and meaning. "I write in
order to annihilate the play of subordinate operations within myself'
(El, p. 242).
The putting at stake, the one which exceeds lordship, is therefore the
space of writing; it is played out between minor writing and major writing,
both unknown to the master, the latter more than the former, the major
play more than the minor play ("For the master, play was nothing, neither
minor nor major" Conferences).
Why is this uniquely the space of writing?
Sovereignty is absolute when it is absolved of every relationship, and
keeps itself in the night of the secret. The continuum of sovereign communication has as its milieu this night of secret difference. One would
understand nothing about it in thinking that there was some contradiction
between these two requisites. In fact, one would understand only that
which is understood in the logic of philosophical lordship: because
for this logic, on the contrary, one must conciliate the desire for
recognition, the breaking of secrecy, discourse, collaboration, etc., with
discontinuity, articulation, and negativity. The opposition of the
continuous and the discontinuous is constantly displaced from Hegel to
Bataille.
But this displacement is powerless to transform the nucleus of predicates. All the attributes ascribed to sovereignty are borrowed from the
(Hegelian) logic of "lordship." We cannot, and Bataille neither could, nor
should dispose of any other concepts or any other signs, any other unity
of word and meaning. The sign "sovereignty" itself, in its opposition to
servility, was issued from the same stock as that of "lordship."

Considered outside its functioning, nothing distinguishes it from
"lordship." One could even abstract from Bataille's text an entire zone
throughout which sovereignty remains inside a classical philosophy of the
subject and, above all, inside the voluntarism27 which Heidegger has shown
still to be confused, in Hegel and Nietzsche, with the essence of
metaphysics.
Since the space which separates the logic of lordship and, if you will, the
nonlogic of sovereignty neither can nor may be inscribed in the nucleus
of the concept itself (for what is discovered here is that there is no nucleus
of meaning, no conceptual atom, but that the concept is produced within
the tissue of differences); it will have to be inscribed within the
continuous chain (or functioning) of a form of writing. This-majorwriting will be called writing because it exceeds the logos (of meaning,
lordship, presence etc.). Within this writing-the one sought by Bataillethe same concepts, apparently unchanged in themselves, will be subject
to a mutation of meaning, or rather will be struck by (even though they
are apparently indifferent), the loss of sense toward which they slide,
thereby ruining themselves immeasurably. To blind oneself to this
rigorous precipitation, this pitiless sacrifice of philosophical concepts, and
to continue to read, interrogate, and judge Bataille's text from within
"significative discourse" is, perhaps, to hear something within it, but it is
assuredly not to read it. Which can always be done-and has it not been?with great agility, resourcefulness occasionally, and philosophical
security. Not to read, is, here, to ignore the formal necessity of Bataille's
text, to ignore its own fragmentation, its relationship to the narratives
whose adventure cannot simply be juxtaposed with aphorisms or with
"philosophical" discourses which erase their signifiers in favor of their
signified contents. Differing from logic, such as it is understood in its
classical concept, even differing from the Hegelian Book which was Kojeve's
theme, Bataille's writing, in its major instance, does not tolerate the
distinction of form and content." Which makes it writing, and a
requisite of sovereignty.
This writing (and without concern for instruction, this is the example
it provides for us, what we are interested in here, today) folds itself in
order to link up with classical concepts-insofar as they are inevitable ("I
could not avoid expressing my thought in a philosophical

mode. But I do not address myself to philosophers" Methode)-in such a way
that these concepts, through a certain twist, apparently obey their habitual
laws; but they do so while relating themselves, at a certain point, to the
moment of sovereignty, to the absolute loss of their meaning, to
expenditure without reserve, to what can no longer even be called
negativity or loss of meaning except on its philosophical side; thus, they
relate themselves to a nonmeaning which is beyond absolute meaning,
beyond the closure or the horizon of absolute knowledge. Carried away
in this calculated sliding,29 concepts become nonconcepts, they are
unthinkable, they become untenable. ("I introduce untenable concepts," Le
petit). The philosopher is blind to Bataille's text because he is a
philosopher only through the desire to hold on to, to maintain his
certainty of himself and the security of the concept as security against
this sliding. For him, Bataille's text is full of traps: it is, in the initial
sense of the word, a scandal.
The transgression of meaning is not an access to the immediate and
indeterminate identity of a nonmeaning, nor is it an access to the possibility
of maintaining nonmeaning. Rather, we would have to speak of an
epochE of the epoch of meaning, of a-written-putting between
brackets that suspends the epoch of meaning: the opposite of a phenomenological epochE, for this latter is carried out in the name and in sight of
meaning. The phenomenological epochE is a reduction that pushes us back
toward meaning. Sovereign transgression is a reduction of this reduction:
not a reduction to meaning, but a reduction of meaning. Thus, while
exceeding the Phenomenology of the Mind, this transgression at the same time
exceeds phenomenology in general, in its most modern developments (cf.
El, p. 19).
Will this new writing depend upon the agency of sovereignty?
Will it obey the imperatives of sovereignty? Will it subordinate itself to
that which subordinates nothing? (And does so, one might say, by essence,
if sovereignty had an essence.) The answer is, not at all; and this is the
unique paradox of the relation between discourse and sovereignty. To
relate the major form of writing to the sovereign operation is to institute a
relation in the form of a nonrelation, to inscribe rupture in the text, to
place the chain of discursive knowledge in relation to an
unknowledge which is not a moment of knowledge: an absolute
unknowledge from whose nonbasis is launched chance, or the wagers

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY

340 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
of meaning, history, and the horizons of absolute knowledge. The
inscription of such a relation will be "scientific," but the word "science" submits to a radical alteration: without losing any of its proper
norms, it is made to tremble, simply by being placed in relation to an
absolute unknowledge. One can call it science only within the transgressed closure, but to do so one will have to answer to all the requirements of this denomination. The unknowledge exceeding science
itself, the unknowledge that will know where and how to exceed science
itself, will not have scientific qualification ("Who will ever know what it is to
know nothing?" Le petit). It will not be a determined unknowledge,
circumscribed by the history of knowledge as a figure taken from (or
leading toward) dialectics, but will be the absolute excess of every
episteme, of every philosophy and every science. Only a double position can
account for this unique relation, which belongs neither to "scientism"
nor "mysticism.""
As the affirmative reduction of sense, rather than the position of
non-sense, sovereignty therefore is not the principle or foundation of this
inscription. A nonprinciple and a nonfoundation, it definitively eludes
any expectation of a reassuring archia, a condition of possibility or
transcendental of discourse. Here, there are no longer any philosophical
preliminaries. The Methode de meditation teaches us that the disciplined
itinerary of writing must rigorously take us to the point at which there
is no longer any method or any meditation, the point at which the
sovereign operation breaks with method and meditation because it
cannot be conditioned by anything that precedes or even prepares it. Just
as it seeks neither to be applied nor propagated, neither to last nor to
instruct (and this is also why, according to Blanchot's expression, its
authority expiates itself), and just as it does not seek recognition, so too it has
no movement of recognition for the discursive and prerequisite labor that
it could not do without. Sovereignty must be ungrateful. "My
sovereignty ... gives me no thanks for my work" (Methode). The
conscientious concern for preliminaries is precisely philosophical and
Hegelian.
The criticism addressed by Hegel to Schelling (in the preface to the
Phenomenology) is no less decisive. The preliminary efforts o f the
operation are not within the reach of an unprepared intelligence (as

341

Hegel says: it would be similarly senseless, if one were not a shoemaker, to
make a shoe). These efforts, through the mode of application which
belongs to them, nevertheless inhibit the sovereign operation (the being
which goes as far as it possibly can). Sovereign behavior precisely demands
a refusal to submit its operation to the condition o f preliminaries. The
operation takes place only if the urgency for it appears: and if the operation
does become urgent, it is no longer time to undertake efforts whose
essence is to be subordinate to ends exterior to them, whose
essence is not to be ends them
selves [Methode].
Now, if one muses upon the fact that Hegel is doubtless the first to have
demonstrated the ontological unity of method and historicity, it must
indeed be concluded that what is exceeded by sovereignty is not only the
"subject" (Methode, p. 75), but history itself Not that one returns, in
classical and pre-Hegelian fashion, to an ahistorical sense which would
constitute a figure of the Phenomenology of the Mind. Sovereignty transgresses the entirety of the history of meaning and the entirety of the
meaning of history, and the project of knowledge which has always
obscurely welded these two together. Unknowledge is, then, superhistorical," but only because it takes its responsibilities from the completion
of history and from the closure of absolute knowledge, having first taken
them seriously and having then betrayed them by exceeding them or by
simulating them in play." In this simulation, I conserve or anticipate the
entirety of knowledge, I do not limit myself to a determined and abstract
kind of knowledge or unknowledge, but I rather absolve myself of
absolute knowledge, putting it back in its place as such, situating it and
inscribing it within a space which it no longer dominates. Bataille's
writing thus relates all semantemes, that is, philosophemes, to the
sovereign operation, to the consummation, without return, of meaning. It
draws upon, in order to exhaust it, the resource of meaning. With minute
audacity, it will acknowledge the rule which constitutes that which it
efficaciously, economically must deconstitute.
Thus proceeding along the lines of what Bataille calls the general
economy

The writing of sovereignty conforms to general economy by at least two
characteristics: (1) it is a science; (2) it relates its objects to the

since it is only a relation to nonmeaning this order is reversed within it. And the
relation to the absolute possibility of knowledge is suspended within it.
The known is related to the unknown, meaning to nonmeaning. "This

The science of relating the object of thought to sovereign moments, in fact,
is only a general economy which envisages the meaning of these objects in
relation to each other and finally in relation to the loss of meaning. The
question of this general economy is situated on the level of political economy,
but the science designated by this name is only a restricted economy,
(restricted to commercial values). In question is the essential problem for
the science dealing with the use of wealth. The general economy, in the
first place, makes apparent that excesses of energy are produced, and that
by definition, these excesses cannot be utilized. The excessive energy can
only be lost without the slightest aim, consequently without any meaning.
It is this useless, senseless loss that is sovereignty. [El, p. 233j.33

could dominate, could comprehend only this circulation, only the circuit of
reproductive consumption. The absolute production and destruction of value, the
exceeding energy as such, the energy which "can only be lost without
the slightest aim, consequently without any meaning"all this escapes
phenomenology as restricted economy. The latter can determine
difference and negativity only as facets, moments, or conditions of
meaning: as work. Now the nonmeaning of the sovereign operation is
neither the negative of, nor the condition for, meaning,. even if it is this
also, and even if this is what its name gives us to understand. It is not
a reserve of meaning. It keeps itself beyond the opposition of the positive
and the negative, for the act of consumption, although it induces the loss of
sense, is not the negative of presence, presence maintained or looked on in
the truth of its meaning (its bewahren). Such a rupture of symmetry must
propagate its effects throughout the entire chain of discourse. The concepts
of general writing can be read only on the condition that they be
deported, shifted outside the symmetrical alternatives from which,
however, they seem to be taken, and in which, after a fashion, they
must also remain. Strategy plays upon this origin and "backwardation."
For example, if one takes into account this commentary on nonmeaning,
then that which indicates itself as nonvalue, within the closure of
metaphysics, refers beyond the opposition of value and nonvalue, even
beyond the concept of value, as it does beyond the concept of meaning. That
which indicates itself as mysticism, in order to shake the security of
discursive knowledge, refers beyond the opposition of the mystic and the
rational." Bataille above all is not a new mystic. That which indicates itself as
interior. experience is not an experience, because it is related to no presence,
to no plentitude, but only to the "impossible" it "undergoes" in torture.
This experience above all is not interior: and if it seems to be such

because it is related to nothing else, to no exterior (except in the modes
of nonrelation, secrecy, and rupture), it is also completely exposed-to
torture-naked, open to the exterior, with no interior reserve or feelings,
profoundly superficial.
One could submit all the concepts of general writing (those of
science, the unconscious, materialism, etc.) to this schematization. The
predicates are not there in order to mean something, to enounce or to
signify, but in order to make sense slide, to denounce it or to deviate

FROM RESTRICTED TO GENERAL ECONOMY

from it. This writing does not necessarily produce new conceptual
unities; and its concepts are not necessarily distinguished from classical
concepts by marked characteristics in the form of essential predicates, but
rather by qualitative differences of force, height, etc., which themselves
are qualified in this way only by metaphor. Tradition's names are
maintained, but they are struck with the differences between the major and
the minor, the archaic and the classic." This is the only way, within discourse, to
mark that which separates discourse from its excess.
However, the writing within which these stratagems operate does not
consist in subordinating conceptual moments to the totality of a system
in which these moments would finally take on meaning. It is not a
question of subordinating the slidings and differences of discourse, the
play of syntax, to the entirety of an anticipated discourse. On the contrary. If
the play of difference is indispensable for the correct reading of the general
economy's concepts, and if each notion must be reinscribed within the
law of its own sliding and must be related to the sovereign operation, one
must not make of these requirements the subordinate moment of a
structure. The reading of Bataille must pass through these two dangerous
straits. It must not isolate notions as if they were their own context, as if
one could immediately understand what the content of words like
"experience," "interior," "mystic," 'word," "material," "sovereign," etc.
means. Here, the error would consist in taking as an immediate given of
reading the blindness to a traditional culture which itself wishes to be
taken as the natural element of discourse. But inversely, one must not
submit contextual attentiveness and differences of signification to a system
of meaning permitting or promising an absolute formal mastery. This
would amount to erasing the excess of nonmeaning and to falling back
into the closure of knowledge: would amount, once more, to not reading
Bataille.
On this point the dialogue with Hegel is again decisive. An example:
Hegel, and following him, whoever installs himself within the sure
element of philosophical discourse, would have been unable to read, in its
regulated sliding, a sign like that of "experience." In I'Erotisme, Bataille
notes, without explaining any further: "In Hegel's mind, what is immediate
is bad, and Hegel certainly would have related what I call experience to
the immediate." Now, if in its major moments, interior experience breaks
with mediation, interior experience is not, however,

345

3 46

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

immediate. It does not pleasurably consume an absolutely close presence, and, above all, it cannot enter into the movement of mediation, as
can the Hegelian immediate. Immediacy and mediacy, such as they are
presented in the elements of philosophy, in Hegel's logic, or in phenomenology, are equally "subordinated." It is thus that they can pass
one into the other. The sovereign operation therefore also suspends
subordination in the form of immediacy. In order to understand that it
does not, at this point, enter into work and phenomenology, one mus
exit from the philosophical logos and think the unthinkable. How can
mediacy and immediacy be transgressed simultaneously? How can
"subordination," in the sense of the (philosophical) logos be exceeded in
its totality? Perhaps through major writings: "I write in order to
annihilate the play of subordinate operations within myself (which is
after all, superfluous)" (Methode). Only perhaps, and this is "after a ll
superfluous," for this writing must assure us of nothing, must give u no
certitude, no result, no profit. It is absolutely adventurous, is a
chance and not a technique.

related to a sovereign and transgressive affirmation. The soverei

operation is not content with neutralizing the classical operations in
discourse; in the major form of experience it transgresses the law or
prohibitions that form a system with discourse, and even with the work of
neutralization. Twenty pages after having proposed a "neutral knowledge": "I
am establishing the possibility of neutral knowledge? my sovereignty
welcomes it in me as the bird sings, and gives me no thanks for my
work."
Also the destruction of discourse is not simply an erasing neutralization.
It multiplies words, precipitates them one against the other, engulfs
them too, in an endless and baseless substitution whose only rule is the
sovereign affirmation of the play outside meaning. Not a reserve or a
withdrawal, not the infinite murmur of a blank speech erasing the traces
of classical discourse, but a kind of potlatch of signs that burns,
consumes, and wastes words in the gay affirmation of death: a
sacrifice and a challenge." Thus, for example:

Previously, I designated the sovereign operation under the names of
interior experience or extremity of the possible. Now, I am also designat
ing it under the name of meditation. The change of words signifies the
bothersomeness of using any words at all (sovereign operation is the most
loathsome of all the names: in a sense, comic operation would be less
deceptive); I prefer meditation, but it has a pious appearance [El,
P. 237).
What has happened? In sum, nothing has been said. We have not ;
stopped at any word; the chain rests on nothing; none of the concepts
satisfies the demand, all are determined by each other and, at the same
time, destroy or neutralize each other. But the rule of the game or,
rather, the game as rule has been affirmed; as has been the necessity of
transgressing both discourse and the negativity of the bothersomeness of
using any word at all in reassuring identity of its meaning.
But this transgression of discourse (and consequently of law in gen
eral, for discourse establishes itself only by establishing normativity or the
value of meaning, that is to say, the element of legality in general) must,
in some fashion, and like every transgression, conserve or confirm that
which it exceeds." This is the only way for it to affirm itself as transgression
and thereby to acceed to the sacred, which "is presented in

We need to interpret interpretations more than to interpret

(Montaigne)
Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure
that could be called an "event," if this loaded word did not entail a
meaning which it is precisely the function of structural-or
structuralist-thought to reduce or to suspect. Let us speak of an
"event," nevertheless, and let us use quotation marks to serve as a
precaution. What would this event be then? Its exterior form would be
that of a rupture and a redoubling.
It would be easy enough to show that the concept of structure and
even the word "structure" itself are as old as the episteme-that is to say,
as old as Western science and Western philosophy-and that their roots
thrust deep into the soil of ordinary language, into whose deepest
recesses the episteme plunges in order to gather them up and to make them
part of itself in a metaphorical displacement. Nevertheless, up to the
event which I wish to mark out and define, structure-or rather the

3 52

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

structurality of structure-although it has always been at work, has
always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a
center or of referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The
function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the
structure-one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structurebut
above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would
limit what we might call the play of the structure. By orienting and
organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits
the play of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a
structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself
Nevertheless, the center also closes off the play which it opens up and
makes possible. As center, it is the point at which the substitution of
contents, elements, or terms is no longer possible. At the center, the
permutation or the transformation of elements (which may of course be
structures enclosed within a structure) is forbidden. At least this
permutation has always remained interdicted (and I am using this wo d
deliberately). Thus it has always been thought that the center, which is by
definition unique, constituted that very thing within a structure which
while governing the structure, escapes structurality. This is why classical
thought concerning structure could say that the center is, paradoxically,
within the structure and outside it. The center is at the center of the totality,
and yet, since the center does not belong to the totality (is not part of the
totality), the totality has its center elsewhere. The center is not the center.
The concept of centered structurealthough it represents coherence itself,
the condition of the episteme as philosophy or science-is contradictorily
coherent. And as always, coherence in contradiction expresses the force
of a desire.' The concept of centered structure is in fact the concept of a
play based on a fundamental ground, a play constituted on the basis of a
fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude, which itself is beyond
the reach of play. And on the basis of this certitude anxiety can be
mastered, for anxiety is invariably the result of a certain mode of being
implicated in the game, of being caught by the game, of being as it were
at stake in the game from the outset. And again on the basis of what we
call the center (and which, because it can be either inside or outside, can
also indifferently be called the origin or end, arche or telos), repetitions,

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY

353

substitutions, transformations, and permutations are always taken from a
history of meaning [sens]-that is, in a word, a history-whose origin
may always be reawakened or whose end may always be anticipated in the
form of presence. This is why one perhaps could say that the movement
of any archaeology, like that of any eschatology, is an accomplice of this
reduction of the structurality of structure and always attempts to conceive of
structure on the basis of a full presence which is beyond play.
If this is so, the entire history of the concept of structure, before the
rupture of which we are speaking, must be thought of as a series of
substitutions of center for center, as a linked chain of determinations of the
center. Successively, and in a regulated fashion, the center receives different
forms or names. The history of metaphysics, like the history of the West, is
the history of these metaphors and metonymies. Its matrix-if you will
pardon me for demonstrating so little and for being so elliptical in
order to come more quickly to my principal theme-is the determination
of Being as presence in all senses of this word. It could be shown that all
the names related to fundamentals, to principles, or to the center have
always designated an invariable presence-eidos, arche, telos, energeia, ousia
(essence, existence, substance, subject) aletheia, transcendentality,
consciousness, God, man, and so
forth.
The event I called a rupture, the disruption I alluded to at the beginning
of this paper, presumably would have come about when the structurality of
structure had to begin to be thought, that is to say, repeated, and this is why
I said that this disruption was repetition in every sense of the word.
Henceforth, it became necessary to think both the law which somehow
governed the desire for a center in the constitution of structure, and the
process of signification which orders the displacements and substitutions
for this law of central presence-but a central presence which has never
been itself, has always already been exiled from itself into its own
substitute. The substitute does not substitute itself for anything which has
somehow existed before it. Henceforth, it was necessary to begin
thinking that there was no center, that the center could not be thought
in the form of a present-being, that the center had no natural site, that it
was not a fixed locus but a function, a sort of nonlocus in which an
infinite number of sign-substitutions

3 54

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

came into play. This was the moment when language invaded the
universal problematic, the moment when, in the absence of a center or
origin, everything became discourse-provided we can agree on this
word-that is to say, a system in which the central signified, the original or transcendental signified, is never absolutely present outside a
system of differences. The absence of the transcendental signified
extends the domain and the play of signification infinitely.
Where and how does this decentering, this thinking the structurality
of structure, occur? It would be somewhat naive to refer to an event, a
doctrine, or an author in order to designate this occurrence. It is n
doubt part of the totality of an era, our own, but still it has always
already begun to proclaim itself and begun to work. Nevertheless, if we
wished to choose several "names," as indications only, and to recall
those authors in whose discourse this occurrence has kept most closely to
its most radical formulation, we doubtless would have to cite the
Nietzschean critique of metaphysics, the critique of the concepts of
Being and truth, for which were substituted the concepts of play;

referring to a signified, a signifier different from its signified. If one erases
the radical difference between signifier and signified, it is the word
"signifier" itself which must be abandoned as a metaphysical concept.
When Levi-Strauss says in the preface to The Raw and the Cooked that he has
"sought to transcend the opposition between the sensible and the

the whole of metaphysics. This is what allows these destroyers to destroy
each other reciprocally-for example, Heidegger regarding Nietzsche,
with as much lucidity and rigor as bad faith and mis
construction, construction, as the last metaphysician, the last "Platonist,"
do the same for Heidegger himself, for Freud, or for a number o
others. And today no exercise is more widespread.
What is the relevance of this formal schema when we turn to what are
called the "human sciences"? One of them perhaps occupies a privil
eged place-ethnology. In fact one can assume that ethnology could
have been born as a science only at the moment when a decentering
had come about: at the moment when European culture-and, in con
sequence, the history of metaphysics and of its concepts-had been
dislocated, driven from its locus, and forced to stop considering itself as
the culture of reference. This moment is not first and foremost a
moment of philosophical or scientific discourse. It is also a moment
which is political, economic, technical, and so forth. One can say with
total security that there is nothing fortuitous about the fact that the
critique of ethnocentrism-the very condition for ethnology-should
be systematically and historically contemporaneous with the destruc-.
tion of the history of metaphysics. Both belong to one and the same.
era. Now, ethnology-like any science-comes about within the elem `
ent of discourse. And it is primarily a European science employing
traditional concepts, however much it may struggle against them. Con
sequently, whether he wants to or not-and this does not depend on 'a
decision on his part-the ethnologist accepts into his discourse the
premises of ethnocentrism at the very moment when he denounces_
them. This necessity is irreducible; it is not a historical contingency'
We ought to consider all its implications very carefully. But if no one,
can escape this necessity, and if no one is therefore responsible for'
giving in to it, however little he may do so, this does not mean that all
the ways of giving in to it are of equal pertinence. The quality and
fecundity of a discourse are perhaps measured by the critical rigor with
which this relation to the history of metaphysics and to inherited
concepts is thought. Here it is a question both of a critical relation to
the language of the social sciences and a critical responsibility of the
discourse itself. It is a question of explicitly and systematically posing.

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY

3 57

the problem of the status of a discourse which borrows from a heritage
the resources necessary for the deconstruction of that heritage itself A
problem of economy and strategy.
If we consider, as an example, the texts of Claude Levi-Strauss, it is not
only because of the privilege accorded to ethnology among the social
sciences, nor even because the thought of Levi-Strauss weighs heavily
on the contemporary theoretical situation. It is above all because a
certain choice has been declared in the work of Levi-Strauss and because a
certain doctrine has been elaborated there, and precisely, .n a more or less
explicit manner, as concerns both this critique of language and this critical
language in the social sciences.
In order to follow this movement in the text of Levi-Strauss, let us
choose as one guiding thread among others the opposition between
nature and culture. Despite all its rejuvenations and disguises, this
opposition is congenital to philosophy. It is even older than Plato. It is
at least as old as the Sophists. Since the statement of the opposition
physis/nomos, physis/technE, it has been relayed to us by means of a whole
historical chain which opposes "nature" to law, to education, to art, to
technics-but also to liberty, to the arbitrary, to history, to society, to
the mind, and so on. Now, from the outset of his researches, and from his
first book (The Elementary Structures of Kinship) on, Levi-Strauss simultaneously has experienced the necessity of utilizing this opposition and
the impossibility of accepting it. In the Elementary Structures, he begins
from this axiom or definition: that which is universal and spontaneous,
and not dependent on any particular culture or on any determinate
norm, belongs to nature. Inversely, that which depends upon a system
of norms regulating society and therefore is capable of varying from one
social structure to another, belongs to culture. These two definitions are o
the traditional type. But in the very first pages of the Elementary
Structures Levi-Strauss, who has begun by giving credence to these con
cepts, encounters what he calls a scandal, that is to say, something which
no longer tolerates the nature/culture opposition he has accepted,
something which simultaneously seems to require the predicates of nature
and of culture. This scandal is the incest prohibition. The incest prohibition
is universal; in this sense one could call it natural. But it is also a
prohibition, a system of norms and interdicts; in this sense one could
it cultural:

its "ontological" nonvalue (as might be said, if this notion were not
suspect here): "However, it would not be enough to reabsorb particular
humanities into a general one. This first enterprise opens the way for
others which ... are incumbent on the exact natural sciences: the
reintegration of culture in nature and finally of life within the whole of its
physico-chemical conditions."5
On the other hand, still in The Savage Mind, he presents as what he calls
bricolage what might be called the discourse of this method. The bricoleur, says
Levi-Strauss, is someone who uses "the means at hand," that is, the
instruments he finds at his disposition around him, those which are
already there, which had not been especially conceived with an eye to the
operation for which they are to be used and to which one tries by trial
and error to adapt them, not hesitating to change them whenever it
appears necessary, or to try several of them at once, even if their form
and their origin are heterogenous-and so forth. There is therefore a
critique of language in the form of bricolage, and it has even been said that
bricolage is critical language itself I am thinking in particular of the article of
G. Genette, "Structuralisme et critique litteraire," published in homage to
Levi-Strauss in a special issue of L'Arc (no. 26, 1965), where it is stated
that the analysis of bricolage could "be applied almost word for
word" to criticism, and especially to "literary criticism."
If one calls bricolage the necessity of borrowing one's concepts from

the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be
said that every discourse is bricoleur. The engineer, whom Levi-Strauss opposes
to the bricoleur, should be the one to construct the totality of his language,
syntax, and lexicon. In this sense the engineer is a myth. A
subject who supposedly would be the absolute origin of his own dis-e course
and supposedly would construct it "out of nothing," "out of,"
whole cloth," would be the creator of the verb, the verb itself The
notion of the engineer who supposedly breaks with all forms of bricolage '` is
therefore a theological idea; and since Levi-Strauss tells us elsewhere
that bricolage is mythopoetic, the odds are that the engineer is a myth
produced by the bricoleur. As soon as we cease to believe in such an engineer and
in a discourse which breaks with the received historical
discourse, and as soon as we admit that every finite discourse is bound 'j by
a certain bricolage and that the engineer and the scientist are also

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY

361

species of bricoleurs, then the very idea of bricolage is menaced and the
difference in which it took on its meaning breaks down.
This brings us to the second thread which might guide us in what is
being contrived here.
Levi-Strauss describes bricolage not only as an intellectual activity but also
as a mythopoetical activity. One reads in The Savage Mind, "Like bricolage
on the technical plane, mythical reflection can reach brilliant unforeseen results
on the intellectual plane. Conversely, attention has often been drawn to the
mythopoetical nature of bricolage."6
But Levi-Strauss's remarkable endeavor does not simply consist in
proposing, notably in his most recent investigations, a structural science
of myths and of mythological activity. His endeavor also appears-I would
say almost from the outset-to have the status which he accords to his own
discourse on myths, to what he calls his "mythologicals." It is here that his
discourse on the myth reflects on itself and criticizes itself. And this
moment, this critical period, is evidently of concern to all the languages
which share the field of the human sciences. What does Levi-Strauss say
of his "mythologicals"? It is here that we rediscover the mythopoetical virtue of
bricolage. In effect, what appears most fascinating in this critical search
for a new status of discourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to
a center, to a subject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute
archia. The theme of this decentering could be followed throughout the
"Overture" to his last book, The Raw and the Cooked. I shall simply remark on
a few key points.
1. From the very start, Levi-Strauss recognizes that the Bororo myth

which he employs in the book as the "reference myth" does not merit
t this name and this treatment. The name is specious and the use of the
myth improper. This myth deserves no more than any other its referential
privilege: "In fact, the Bororo myth, which I shall refer to from now on as the
key myth, is, as I shall try to show, simply a transformation, to a greater or
lesser extent, of other myths originating either in the same society or in
neighboring or remote societies. I could, therefore, have legitimately
taken as my starting point any one representative myth of the group. From
this point of view, the key myth is interesting not because it is typical,
but rather because of its irregular position within the group."'

362

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

2. There is no unity or absolute source of the myth. The focus or the
source of the myth are always shadows and virtualities which are elusive,
unactualizable, and nonexistent in the first place. Everything begins with
structure, configuration, or relationship. The discourse on the acentric
structure that myth itself is, cannot itself have an absolute subject or an
absolute center. It must avoid the violence that consists in centering a
language which describes an acentric structure if it is not to shortchange
the form and movement of myth. Therefore it is necessary to forego
scientific or philosophical discourse, to renounce the episteme which
absolutely requires, which is the absolute requirement that we go back
to the source, to the center, to the founding basis, to the principle,
and so on. In opposition to epistemic discourse, structural discourse on
myths-mythological discourse-must itself be mythomorphic. It must have
the form of that of which it speaks. This is what LeviStrauss says in The
Raw and the Cooked, from which I would now like to quote a long and
remarkable passage:
The study of myths raises a methodological problem, in that it cannot be
carried out according to the Cartesian principle of breaking down the
difficulty into as many parts as may be necessary for finding the
solution. There is no real end to methodological analysis, no hidden
unity to be grasped once the breaking-down process has been completed. Themes can be split up ad infinitum. just when you think you have
disentangled and separated them, you realize that they are knitting
together again in response to the operation of unexpected affinities.
Consequently the unity of the myth is never more than tendential and
projective and cannot reflect a state or a particular moment of the myth. It is
a phenomenon of the imagination, resulting from the attempt at
interpretation; and its function is to endow the myth with synthetic form
and to prevent its disintegration into a confusion of opposites. The science
of myths might therefore be termed "anaclastic," if we take this old term
in the broader etymological sense which includes the study of both
reflected rays and broken rays. But unlike philosophical reflection, which
aims to go back to its own source, the reflections we are dealing with here
concern rays whose only source is hypothetical.... And in seeking to imitate
the spontaneous movement of mythological thought, this essay, which is
also both too brief

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY

363

and too long, has had to conform to the requirements of that thought and
to respect its rhythm. It follows that this book on myths is itself a kind of
myth.'
This statement is repeated a little farther on: "As the myths themselves are
based on secondary codes (the primary codes being those that
provide the substance of language), the present work is put forward as a
tentative draft of a tertiary code, which is intended to ensure the
reciprocal translatability of several myths. This is why it would not be
wrong to consider this book itself as a myth: it is, as it were, the myth of
mythology."9 The absence of a center is here the absence of a subject and
the absence of an author: "Thus the myth and the musical work are like
conductors of an orchestra, whose audience becomes the silent
performers. If it is now asked where the real center of the work is to be
found, the answer is that this is impossible to determine. Music and
mythology bring man face to face with potential objects of which only the
shadows are actualized.... Myths are anonymous."" The musical
model chosen by Levi-Strauss for the composition of his book is apparently
justified by this absence of any real and fixed center of the mythical or
mythological discourse.
Thus it is at this point that ethnographic bricolage deliberately assumes its
mythopoetic function. But by the same token, this function makes the
philosophical or epistemological requirement of a center appear as
mythological, that is to say, as a historical illusion.
Nevertheless, even if one yields to the necessity of what Levi-Strauss
has done, one cannot ignore its risks. If the mythological is mythomorphic,
are all discourses on myths equivalent? Shall we have to abandon any
epistemological requirement which permits us to distinguish between
several qualities of discourse on the myth? A classic, but inevitable
question. It cannot be answered-and I believe that LeviStrauss does not
answer it-for as long as the problem of the relations between the
philosopheme or the theorem, on the one hand, and the mytheme or the
mythopoem, on the other, has not been posed explicitly, which is no small
problem. For lack of explicitly posing this problem, we condemn ourselves
to transforming the alleged transgression of philosophy into an unnoticed
fault within the philosophical realm. Empiricism would be the genus of
which these faults would

364

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

always be the species. Transphilosophical concepts would be transformed into philosophical naivetes. Many examples could be given to
demonstrate this risk: the concepts of sign, history, truth, and so forth.
What I want to emphasize is simply that . the passage beyond philosophy does not consist in turning the page of philosophy (which
usually amounts to philosophizing badly), but in continuing to read
philosophers in a certain way. The risk I am speaking of is always assumed by
Levi-Strauss, and it is the very price of this endeavor. I have said that
empiricism is the matrix of all faults menacing a discourse which
continues, as with Levi-Strauss in particular, to consider itself scientific. If
we wanted to pose the problem of empiricism and bricolage in depth, we
would probably end up very quickly with a number of absolutely
contradictory propositions concerning the status of discourse in structural ethnology. On the one hand, structuralism justifiably claims to be
the critique of empiricism. But at the same time there is not a single
book or study by Levi-Strauss which is not proposed as an empirical
essay which can always be completed or invalidated by new information. The structural schemata are always proposed as hypotheses resulting
from a finite quantity of information and which are subjected to
the proof of experience. Numerous texts could be used to demonstrate
this double postulation. Let us turn once again to the "Overture" of The
Raw and the Cooked, where it seems clear that if this postulation is double, it is
because it is a question here of a language on language:
If critics reproach me with not having carried out an exhaustive inventory
of South American myths before analyzing them, they are making a grave
mistake about the nature and function of these documents. The total body
of myth belonging to a given community is comparable to its speech.
Unless the population dies out physically or morally, this totality is never
complete. You might as well criticize a linguist for compiling the grammar
of a language without having complete records of the words pronounced
since the language came into being, and without knowing what will be said
in it during the future part of its existence. Experience proves that a linguist
can work out the grammar of a given language from a remarkably small
number of sentences.... And even a partial grammar or an outline
grammar is a precious acquisition when we are dealing with unknown
languages. Syntax does

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY

365

not become evident only after a (theoretically limitless) series of events has
been recorded and examined, because it is itself the body of rules
governing their production. What I have tried to give is an outline of the syntax
of South American mythology. Should fresh data come to hand, they will be
used to check or modify the formulation of certain grammatical laws, so
that some are abandoned and replaced by new ones. But in no instance
would I feel constrained to accept the arbitrary demand for a total
mythological pattern, since, as has been shown, such a requirement has
no meaning."
Totalization, therefore, is sometimes defined as useless, and sometimes as
impossible. This is no doubt due to the fact that there are two ways of
conceiving the limit of totalization. And I assert once more that these
two determinations coexist implicitly in Levi-Strauss's discourse. Totalization can be judged impossible in the classical style: one then refers to
the empirical endeavor of either a subject or a finite richness which it can
never master. There is too much, more than one can say. But
nontotalization can also be determined in another way: no longer from the
standpoint of a concept of finitude as relegation to the empirical, but
from the standpoint of the concept of play. If totalization no longer has any
meaning, it is not because the infiniteness of a field cannot be covered by
a finite glance or a finite discourse, but because the nature of the fieldthat is, language and a finite language-excludes totalization. This field
is in effect that of play, that is to say, a field of infinite substitutions only
because it is finite, that is to say, because instead of being an
inexhaustible field, as in the classical hypothesis, instead of being too
large, there is something missing from it: a center which arrests and
grounds the play of substitutions. One could sayrigorously using that
word whose scandalous signification is always obliterated in Frenchthat this movement of play, permitted by the lack or absence of a center
or origin, is the movement of supplementarity. One cannot determine the
center and exhaust totalization because the sign which replaces the
center, which supplements it, taking the center's place in its absencethis sign is added, occurs as a surplus, as a supplement." The
movement of signification adds something, which results in the fact
that there is always more, but this addition is a floating one because
it comes to perform a vicarious function, to

366 WRITING

AND DIFFERENCE

supplement a lack on the part of the signified. Although Levi-Strauss in his
use of the word "supplementary" never emphasizes, as I do here, the
two directions of meaning which are so strangely compounded within
it, it is not by chance that he uses this word twice in his "Introduction to
the Work of Marcel Mauss," at one point where he is speaking of the
"overabundance of signifier, in relation to the signifieds to which this
overabundance can refer":
In his endeavor to understand the world, man therefore always has at his
disposal a surplus of signification (which he shares out amongst
things according to the laws of symbolic thought-which is the task of
ethnologists and linguists to study). This distribution of a supplemen tary
allowance [ration supply mentaire]-if it is permissible to put it that way-is
absolutely necessary in order that on the whole the available signifier and
the signified it aims at may remain in the relationship of complementarity
which is the very condition of the use of symbolic thought.""
(It could no doubt be demonstrated that this ration supplementaire of signification is the origin of the ratio itself) The word reappears a little
further on, after Levi-Strauss has mentioned "this floating signifier,'
which is the servitude of all finite thought":
In other words-and taking as our guide Mauss's precept that all social
phenomena can be assimilated to language-we see in mana, Wakau,
oranda and other notions of the same type, the conscious expression of a
semantic function, whose role it is to permit symbolic thought to operate
in spite ofthe contradiction which is proper to it. In this way are explained
the apparently insoluble antinomies attached to this notion.... At one and
the same time force and action, quality and state, noun and verb;
abstract and concrete, omnipresent and localized-mana is in effect all
these things. But is it not precisely because it is none of these things that
mana is a simple form, or more exactly, a symbol in the pure state, and
therefore capable of becoming charged with any sort of symbolic content
whatever? In the system of symbols constituted by all cosmologies, mana
would simply be a zero symbolic value, that is to say, a sign marking the
necessity of a

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY

367

symbolic content supplementary [my italics] to that with which the signified
is already loaded, but which can take on any value required, provided only
that this value still remains part of the available reserve and is not, as
phonologists put it, a group-term."
Levi-Strauss adds the note:
"Linguists have already been led to formulate hypotheses of this
type. For example: 'A zero phoneme is opposed to all the other phonemes in French in that it entails no differential characters and no constant phonetic value. On the contrary, the proper function of the zero
phoneme is to be opposed to phoneme absence.' (R. Jakobson and J.
Lutz, "Notes on the French Phonemic Pattern," Word 5, no. 2 [August
1949]: 155). Similarly, if we schematize the conception I am proposing
here, it could almost be said that the function of notions like mana is to be
opposed to the absence of signification, without entailing by itself any
particular signification." 14
The overabundance of the signifier, its supplementary character, is thus the result
of a finitude, that is to say, the result of a lack which must be supplemented.
It can now be understood why the concept of play is important in
Levi-Strauss. His references to all sorts of games, notably to roulette, are very
frequent, especially in his Conversations," in Race and History, 16 and in The
Savage Mind. Further, the reference to play is always caught up in
tension.
Tension with history, first of all. This is a classical problem, objections
to which are now well worn. I shall simply indicate what seems to me the
formality of the problem: by reducing history, Levi-Strauss has treated as it
deserves a concept which has always been in complicity with a
teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words,
paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it
was believed history could be opposed. The thematic of historicity,
although it seems to be a somewhat late arrival in philosophy, has
always been required by the determination of Being as presence. With or
without etymology, and despite the classic antagonism which opposes
these significations throughout all of classical thought, it could be shown that
the concept of episteme has always called forth that of
historia, if history is always the unity of a becoming, as the tradition of

368

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

truth or the development of science or knowledge oriented toward the
appropriation of truth in presence and self-presence, toward knowledge
in consciousness-of-self. History has always been conceived as
the movement of a resumption of history, as a detour between two
presences. But if it is legitimate to suspect this concept of history, there is a
risk, if it is reduced without an explicit statement of the problem I am
indicating here, of falling back into an ahistoricism of a classical type,
that is to say, into a determined moment of the history of metaphysics.
Such is the algebraic formality of the problem as I see it. More concretely,
in the work of Levi-Strauss it must be recognized that the respect for
structurality, for the internal originality of the structure; compels a
neutralization of time and history. For example, the appearance ance of a
new structure, of an original system, always comes about
and this is the very condition of its structural specificity-by a rupture
with its past, its origin, and its cause. Therefore one can describe what'`:
is peculiar to the structural organization only by not taking into
account, in the very moment of this description, its past conditions: by,
omitting to posit the problem of the transition from one structure to
another, by putting history between brackets. In this " structuralist"' j
moment, the concepts of chance and discontinuity are indispensable.
And Levi-Strauss does in fact often appeal to them, for example, as
concerns that structure of structures, language, of which he says in the
Introduction to the Work of Marcel Mauss" that it "could only have been
born in one fell swoop":
Whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of it
appearance on the scale of animal life, language could only have been born
in one fell swoop. Things could not have set about acquiring signification
progressively. Following a transformation the study of "

and psychology, a transition came about from a stage where nothing' had
a meaning to another where everything possessed it.'7
This standpoint does not prevent Levi-Strauss from recognizing the
slowness, the process of maturing, the continuous toil of factual trans-'
formations, history (for example, Race and History). But, in accordance
with a gesture which was also Rousseau's and Husserl's, he must "set

STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY 3 6 9

aside all the facts" at the moment when he wishes to recapture the
specificity of a structure. Like Rousseau, he must always conceive of the
origin of a new structure on the model of catastrophe-an overturning
of nature in nature, a natural interruption of the natural sequence, a
setting aside of nature.
Besides the tension between play and history, there is also the ten
sion between play and presence. Play is the disruption of presence. The
presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference
inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Play
is always play of absence and presence, but if it is to be thought radically,
play must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and
absence. Being must be conceived as presence or absence on the basis
of the possibility of play and not the other way around. If Levi-Strauss,
better than any other, has brought to light the play of repetition and the
repetition of play, one no less perceives in his work a sort of ethic of
presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and
natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self-presence in speech-an
ethic, nostalgia, and even remorse, which he often pres
ents as the motivation of the ethnological project when he moves
toward the archaic societies which are exemplary societies in his eyes.
These texts are well known."
Turned towards the lost or impossible presence of the absent origin, this
structuralist thematic of broken immediacy is therefore the saddened,
negative, nostalgic, guilty, Rousseauistic side of the thinking of play whose
other side would be the Nietzschean affirmation, that is the joyous
affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of becoming,
the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth, and
without origin which is offered to an active interpretation. This affirmation
then determines the noncenter otherwise than as loss of the center. And it plays without
security. For there is a sure play: that which is limited to the substitution of
given and existing, present, pieces. In absolute chance, affirmation also
surrenders itself to genetic indetermination, to the seminal adventure of the
trace.
There are thus two interpretations of interpretation, of structure, of
sign, of play. The one seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering a truth or
an origin which escapes play and the order of the sign, and which lives
the necessity of interpretation as an exile. The other, which is no

3 7 0 WRITING AND DIFFERENCE
longer turned toward the origin, affirms play and tries to pass beyond man
and humanism, the name of man being the name of that being who,
throughout the history of metaphysics or of ontotheology-in other
words, throughout his entire history-has dreamed of full presence, the
reassuring foundation, the origin and the end of play. The second
interpretation of interpretation, to which Nietzsche pointed the way, does
not seek in ethnography, as Levi-Strauss does, the "inspiration of a new
humanism" (again citing the "Introduction to the Work of Marcel Mauss").
There are more than enough indications today to suggest we might
perceive that these two interpretations of interpretation-which are
absolutely irreconcilable even if we live them simultaneously and reconcile them in an obscure economy-together share the field which we
call, in such a problematic fashion, the social sciences.
For my part, although these two interpretations must acknowledge and
accentuate their difference and define their irreducibility, I do not believe
that today there is any question of choosing-in the first place because here we
are in a region (let us say, provisionally, a region of historicity) where the
category of choice seems particularly trivial; and in the second, because
we must first try to conceive of the common ground, and the difference of
this irreducible difference. Here there is a kind of question, let us still call it
historical, whose conception, formation, gestation, and labor we are only
catching a glimpse of today. I employ these words, I admit, with a glance
toward the operations of childbearing-but also with a glance toward
those who, in a society from which I do not exclude myself, turn their
eyes away when faced by the as yet unnamable which is proclaiming
itself and which can do so, as is necessary whenever a birth is in the
offing, only under the species of the nonspecies, in the formless, mute,
infant, and terrifying form of monstrosity.

11
ELLIPSIS
for Gabriel Bounore
Here or there we have discerned writing: a nonsymmetrical division
designated on the one hand the closure of the book, and on the other the
opening of the text. On the one hand the theological encyclopedia and,
modeled upon it, the book of man. On the other a fabric of traces marking
the disappearance of an exceeded God or of an erased man. The
question of writing could be opened only if the book was closed. The
joyous wandering of the graphein then became wandering without return. The
opening into the text was adventure, expenditure without reserve.
And yet did we not know that the closure of the book was not a
simple limit among others? And that only in the book, coming back to it
unceasingly, drawing all our resources from it, could we indefinitely
designate the writing beyond the book?
Which brings us to consider Le retour an livre' (The Return to the Book).
Under this heading, Edmond Jabes first tells us what it is "to abandon the
book." If closure is not end, we protest or deconstruct in vain,

God succeeds God and the Book succeeds the Book.

But within this movement of succession, riting keeps its vigil,

between God and God, between the Book and the Book. And if writing
takes shape on the basis of both this vigil and the beyond of the closure,
then the return to the book does not enclose us within the book. The
return is a moment of wandering, it repeats the epoch of the book, its
totality suspended between two forms of writing, its withdrawal, and that
which is reserved within it.
A book which is the interfacing of a risk....
... My life, from the book on, will have been a vigil of writing in the
interval of limits.

Repetition does not reissue the book but describes its origin from
the vantage of a writing which does not yet belong to it, or no longer
belongs to it, a writing which feigns, by repeating the book, inclusion in
the book. Far from letting itself be oppressed or enveloped within the
volume, this repetition is the first writing. The writing of the origin, the
writing that retraces the origin, tracking down the signs of its
disappearance, the lost writing of the origin.
To write is to have the passion of the origin.

But what disposes it in this way, we now know, is not the origin, but
that which takes its place; which is not, moreover, the opposite of an
origin. It is not absence instead of presence, but a trace which replaces a
presence which has never been present, an origin by means of which
nothing has begun. Now, the book has lived on this lure: to have given us
to believe that passion, having originally been impassioned by
something, could in the end be appeased by the return of that
something. Lure of the origin, the end, the line, the ring, the volume, the
center.
As in the first Book of Questions, imaginary rabbis answer each other, in the
Song on TheRing.
The line is the lure
Reb Seab
One of m y greatest anxieties, said Reb Aghim, was to see, without being able
to stop it, my life curve itself to form a ring.

Once the circle turns, once the volume rolls itself up, once the book is
repeated, its identification with itself gathers an imperceptible difference
which permits us efficaciously, rigorously, that is, discreetly, to exit
from closure. In redoubling the closure of the book, one cuts it in half.
One then furtively escapes from it, between two passageways through
the same book, the same line, along the same ring, "vigil of writing in the
interval of limits." This exit from the identical into the same' remains very
slight, weighs nothing itself, thinks and weighs the book as such. The
return to the book is then the abandoning of the book; it has slipped in
between God and God, the Book and the Book, in the neutral space of
succession, in the suspense of the interval. The return, at this point, does
not retake possession of something. It does not reappropriate the
origin. The latter is no longer in itself Writing, passion of the origin,
must also be understood through the subjective genetive. It is the origin
itself which is impassioned, passive, and past, in that it is written. Which
means inscribed. The inscription of the origin is doubtless its Beingas-writing, but it is also its Being-asinscribed in a system in which it is
only a function and a locus.
Thus understood, the return to the book is of an elliptical essence.
Something invisible is missing in the grammar of this repetition. As this lack
is invisible and undeterminable, as it completely redoubles and
consecrates the book, once more passing through each point along its
circuit, nothing has budged. And yet all meaning is altered by this lack.
Repeated, the same line is no longer exactly the same, the ring no
longer has exactly the same center, the origin has played. Something is missing that
would make the circle perfect. But within the ellipsis, by means of simple
redoubling of the route, the solicitation of closure, and the jointing of the
line, the book has let itself be thought as such.
And Yukel said:
The circle is acknowledged. Break the curve. The route doubles the route. The
book consecrates the book.

The return to the book here announces the form of the eternal
return.' The return of the same does not alter itself-but does so
absolutely-except by amounting to the same. Pure repetition, were it to
change neither thing nor sign, carries with it an unlimited power of
perversion and subversion.

WRITING AND DIFFERENCE

This repetition is writing because what disappears in it is the selfidentity of the origin, the self-presence of so-called living speech. That is
the center. The first book, the mythic book, the eve prior to all
repetition, has lived on the deception that the center was sheltered
from play: irreplaceable, withdrawn from metaphor and metonymy, a
kind of invariable first name that could be invoked, but not repeated.
The center of the first book should not have been repeatable in its ,
own representation. Once it lends itself a single time to such a
representation-that is to say, once it is written-when one can read a
book in the book, an origin in the origin, a center in the center, it is
the abyss, is the bottomlessness of infinite redoubling. The other is in the
same,
The Elsewhere within ... The
center is the well.. .
"Where is the center?" screamed Reb Madies. "The scorned water permits the
falcon to pursue his prey."
The center, perhaps, is the displacement of the question.
No center there where the circle is impossible.
" M a y m y death come from myself," said Reb Bekri.
"For I would then be, all at once, both the servitude of the ring and the
caesura."

As soon as a sign emerges, it begins by repeating itself Without this, it
would not be a sign, would not be what it is, that is to say, the nonselfidentity which regularly refers to the same. That is to say, to another
sign, which itself will be born of having been divided. The grapheme,
repeating itself in this fashion, thus has neither natural site nor natural
center. But did it ever lose them? Is its excentricity a decentering? Can
one not affirm the nonreferral to the center, rather than bemoan the absence
of the center? Why would one mourn for the center? Is not the center, the
absence of play and difference, another name for death? The death which
reassures and appeases, but also, with its hole, creates anguish and puts at
stake?
The passage through negative excentricity is doubtless necessary; but
only liminary.

ELLIPSIS

375

The center is the threshold.
Reb Naman said: "God is the center; this is why great minds have
proclaimed that He did not exist, for if the center of an apple or the star is the
heart of the heavenly body or of the fruit, which is the true middle of the
orchard and the night?"
And Yukel said:
The center is failure.
"Where is the center? [Oiu est le centre?]
-Under ashes. [Sous la cendre]"
Reb Selah
"The center is mourning."

Just as there is a negative theology, there is a negative atheology. An
accomplice of the former, it still pronounces the absence of a center, when
it is play that should be affirmed. But is not the desire for a center, as
a function of play itself, the indestructible itself? And in the repetition or
return of play, how could the phantom of the center not call to us? It is
here that the hesitation between writing as decentering and writing as an
affirmation of play is infinite. This hesitation is part of play and links it to
death. Hesitation occurs within a "who knows?" without subject or
knowledge.
The last obstacle, the ultimate limit is, who knows? the center.
For then everything comes to us from the end of the night, from childhood.

If the center is indeed "the displacing of the question," it is because the
unnamable bottomless well whose sign the center was, has always been
surnamed; the center as the sign of a hole that the book attempted to fill. The
center was the name of a hole; and the name of man, like the name of God,
pronounces the force of that which has been raised up in the hole in
order to operate as a work in the form of a book. The volume, the scroll
of parchment, was to have insinuated itself into the dangerous hole, was
to have furtively penetrated into the menacing dwelling place with an
animal-like, quick, silent, smooth, brilliant, sliding motion, in the
fashion of a serpent or a fish. Such is the anxious desire
of the book. It is tenacious too, and parasitic, loving and breathing

with your shadow [avec ton ombre], Sarah,
within the number [dans le nombre), Yukel, at
the end of my questions, at the foot of the three

questions ...
Death is at the dawn because everything has begun with repetition.
Once the center or the origin have begun by repeating themselves, by
redoubling themselves, the double did not only add itself to the simple. It
divided it and supplemented it. There was immediately a double origin
plus its repetition. Three is the first figure of repetition. The last too, for
the abyss of representation always remains dominated by its rhythm,
infinitely. The infinite is doubtless neither one, nor empty, nor innumerable.
It is of a ternary essence. Two, like the second Book of questions (The Book
of Yukel), like Yukel, remains the indispensable and useless articulator of the
book, the sacrificed mediator without which triplicity would not be, and
without which meaning would not be what it is, that is to say, different
from itself: in play, at stake. To articulate is to joint. One could say of
the second book what is said of Yukel in the second part of the Return to the
book:
"He was liana and lierne in the book, before being expelled from it."

If nothing has preceded repetition, if no present has kept watch over the
trace, if, after a fashion, it is the "void which reempties itself and marks
itself with imprints," 4 then the time of writing no longer follows the line
of modified present tenses. What is to come is not a future present,
yesterday is not a past present. The beyond of the closure of the book is
neither to be awaited nor to be refound. It is there, but out there, beyond,
within repetition, but eluding us there. It is there like the shadow of the
book, the third party between the hands holding the book, the deferral
within the now of writing, the distance between the book and the book,
that other hand.
Opening the third part of the third Book of Questions, thus begins the song
on distance and accent:
"Tomorrow is the shadow and reflexibility of our hands."

1: FORCE AND SIGNIFICATION

In L'univers imaginaire de Mallarme (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1961, p. 30, n.
27), Jean-Pierre Richard writes: "We would be content if our work could
provide some new materials for a future history of imagination and
affectivity; this history, not yet written for the nineteenth century, would
probably be an extension of the works of Jean Rousset on the Baroque, Paul
Hazard on the eighteenth century, Andre Monglond on preromanticism."
2. In his Anthropology (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1948, p. 325) A. L.
Kroeber notes: "'Structure' appears to be just a yielding to a word that has a
perfectly good meaning but suddenly becomes fashionably attractive for
a decade or so-like 'streamlining'-and during its vogue tends to be
applied indiscriminately because of the pleasurable connotations of its
sound."
To grasp the profound necessity hidden beneath the incontestable
phenomenon of fashion, it is first necessary to operate negatively: the
1.

choice of a word is first an ensemble-a structural ensemble, of
course-of exclusions. To know why one says "structure" is to know
why one no longer wishes to say eidos, "essence," form, Gestalt,
"ensemble," "composition," "complex," "construction," "correlation,"
"totality," "Idea," "organism," "state," "system," etc. One must
understand not only why each of these words showed itself to be
insufficient but also why the notion of structure continues to borrow
some implicit signification from them and to be inhabited by them. TN.
The most consistently difficult sections of Derrida's texts are his
"prefatory" remarks, for reasons that he has explained in "Hors-livre," the
preface to La dissemination (Paris: Seuil, 1972). The question hinges
upon the classical difference between a philosophical text and its
preface, the preface usually being a recapitulation of the truth presented
by the text. Since Derrida challenges the notion that a text can present a
truth, his prefaces-in which this challenge is anticipatedmust
especially mark that which makes a text explode the classical ideas of truth
and presence. And they must do so without letting the preface
anticipate this "conclusion" as a single, clear, luminous truth. Thus the
complication of these prefaces. One way of complicating a preface is to
leave as a knot that which will later become several strands. Here, the
relationship between history, somnambulism, the "question" and the
difference between almost-everything and almostnothing is not explained,
for the unraveling of this question touches at least on the topics of the
relationship between history and philosophy (cf. below, "Violence and
Metaphysics"), and the relation of both of these, as writing or texts, to
Freud's analysis of the "text of somnambulism," i.e., The interpretation of
Dreams (cf. below, "Freud and the Scene of Writing").
On the theme ofthe separation of the writer, cf, particularly chapter 3 of
Jean Rousset's introduction of his Forme et Signification. Delacroix,
Diderot, Balzac, Baudelaire, Mallarme, Proust, Valery, Henry James,
T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf are called upon to bear witness to the fact

4. that separation is diametrically opposed to critical impotency. By
insisting upon this separation between the critical act and creative
force, we are only designating the most banally essential-others
might say, structural-necessity attached to these two actions and
moments. Impotence, here, is a property not of the critic but of criticism. The two are sometimes confused. Flaubert does not deny himself
this confusion. This is brought to light in the admirable collection of
letters edited by Genevieve Bolleme and entitled Preface d la vie

d'ecrivain (Paris: Seuil, 1963). Attentive to the fact that the critic takes his
material from the work rather than bringing anything to it, Flaubert writes:
"One writes criticism when one cannot create art, just as one becomes
a spy when one cannot be a soldier .... Plautus would have laughed at
Aristotle had he known him! Corneille resisted him all he could! Voltaire
himself was belittled by Boileau! We would have been spared much evil
in modern drama without Schlegel. And when the translation of Hegel
is finished, Lord knows where we will end up!" (Bolleme, p. 42). The
translation of Hegel hasn't been finished, thank the Lord, thus explaining
Proust, Joyce, Faulkner and several others. The difference between
Mallarme and these authors is perhaps the reading of Hegel. Or that
Mallarme chose, at least, to approach Hegel. In any event, genius still has
some respite, and translations can be left unread. But Flaubert was right
to fear Hegel: "One may well hope that art will continue to advance and
perfect itself, but its form has ceased to be the highest need of the spirit.
In all these relationships art is and remains for us, on the side of its
highest vocation, something past" ("Vorlesungen uber die Aesthetik," in
Martin Heidegger: Poetry, Language, Thought, trans. Albert Hofstadter
[New York: Harper and Row, 1971]). The citation continues: "It [art] has
lost, for us, its truth and its life. It invites us to a philosophical reflection
which does not insure it any renewal, but rigorously recognizes its
essence."

work says what has been conceived or seen; so much so that from the
experience to the work there is only the transition to the techniques of
execution. For modern art the work is not expression but creation: it
makes visible what was not visible before it, it forms instead of reflect
important difference and, in our eyes, an important conquest of modern art,
or rather of the consciousness of the creative process achieved by this art ..." (my
scious today of the creative process in general). For Picon, the mutation
affects art and not only the modern consciousness of art. He wrote
elsewhere: "The history of modern poetry is entirely that of the substitution
of a language of creation for a language of expression .... Language
must now produce the world that it can no longer express" (Introduction d

question is the notion of metaphor, which implies the transfer ofthe name
of a thing to another thing with a different name. In a sense, any
application of a name to a thing is always metaphorical, and for many
philosophies (e.g., those of Rousseau and Condillac) metaphor is the
origin of language. The question, then, is whether there is an origin of
metaphor, an absolutely nonmetaphorical concept, as, for example, the verb
to be, or the notion of breathing, for which Nietzsche says the notion of
Being is a metaphor (in Greek Philosophy during the Tragic Age). If it
could be shown that there is no absolute origin of metaphor,

NOTES TO PAGES 7-9 383

the separation or space implied in metaphor as transfer would
become problematical, as it would then be nonreducible.

22. TN. The play is on the etymology of anguish, from the Latin angustia,
meaning narrowness or distress.
23. Also, the anguish of a breath that cuts itself off in order to reenter
itself, to aspirate itself and return to its original source. Because to
speak is to know that thought must become alien to itself in order to be
pronounced and to appear. It wishes, then, to take itself back by offering
itself. This is why one senses the gesture ofwithdrawal, of retaking
possession of the exhaled word, beneath the language of the authentic
writer, the writer who wishes to maintain the greatest proximity to the
origin of his act. This too is inspiration. One can say of original language what Feuerbach says of philosophical language: "Philosophy
emerges from mouth or pen only in order to return immediately to its
proper source; it does not speak for the pleasure of speaking-whence its
antipathy for fine phrases-but in order not to speak, in order to think
.... To demonstrate is simply to show that what I say is true; simply to
grasp once more the alienation (Entausserung) of thought at the original
source of thought. Thus the signification of the demonstration cannot be
conceived without reference to the signification of language. Language is
nothing other than the realization ofthe species, t he mediation between the I
and the thou which is to represent the unity of the species by means of the
suppression (Aufhebung) of their individual isolation. This is why the
element of speech is air, the most spiritual and most universal vital
medium" (Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Philosophie, 1839, in L. Feuerbach,
Samtliche Werke, vol. 2 [Stuttgart
Bad Canstatt, 19591, PP 169-70).
But did Feuerbach muse upon the fact that vaporized language forgets
itself? That air is not the element in which history develops if it does
not rest (itself) on earth? Heavy, serious, solid earth. The earth that is
worked upon, scratched, written upon. The no less universal element
in which meaning is engraved so that it will last.

384 NOTES TO PAGES 9-10
Hegel would be of more assistance here. For even though he too, in a
spiritual metaphorization of natural elements, thinks that "air is the
unchanging factor, purely universal and transparent; water, the reality'
that is forever being resolved and given up; fire, their animating unity, he
nevertheless posits that "earth is the tightly compact knot of this
articulated whole, the subject in which these realities are, where their
processes take effect, that which they start from and to which they
return" (Phenomenology of the Mind, trans. J. B. Baillie [London:
George Allen & Unwin, 1931], P. 518.
The problem of the relation between writing and the earth is also
that of the possibility of such a metaphorization of the elements. Of its
origin and meaning.
TN. The Hebrew rush, like the Greek pneuma, means both wind or
breath and soul or spirit. Only in God are breath and spirit, speech and
thought, absolutely identical; man can always be duplicitous, his

34. TN. In his translation of the Old Testament, Buber attempted to
restore as much as possible the polysemantic structure of certain key
words upon which he based his interpretations. Derrida here is
attempting to examine the presuppositions of construing certain
words or ideas as the source of the play of difference implied in linguistic multivalence. The idea that seems to support the next few
sentences (in the text) is that if there is no source of"Being," "Being"
must then be understood like a game, that is, only in function of itself.
Language would then most accurately "approximate" Being when it, too,
functions only in relation to itself-"poetry"-without attempting to
adequate itself to any particular existent. One could then be led to speak
of language as having no reference to signified meanings but rather as
creating these meanings through the play of signifiers. The signifier is
always that which is inscribed or written.

Heideggerean-which is not to say that he is simply adopting
Heidegger's ideas, but is rather gradually putting Heidegger into question.

with affectivity as the index of finitude-these are all Heideggerean
themes related to the problem of transcendence as discussed at length,
and unreproducibly, in Heideggei s Kant and the Question of Metaphysics,

47. TN. I.e., of structure as a metaphor for locality, site.
48. TN. This is the question of the closure of metaphysics, for metaphys
ics contains every discourse that attempts to emerge from it. According
to Derrida, metaphysics can only be destroyed from within, by making
its own language-which is the only language we have-work against it.
49. Here are several formulations of this "permanent structure": "where
is the true play? It is in the superimposing and interweaving ofthe two
levels, in the separations and exchanges established between them,
offering us the subtle pleasure of binocular viewing and double reading"
(Rousset, Forme et Signification, p. 56). "From this point of view, all of
Marivaux's plays could be defined as an organism existing on two
levels whose designs gradually approach until they are completely
joined. The play is over when the two levels are indistinguishable, that is,
when the group of heroes watched by the spectators sees itself as the
spectator-characters saw them. The real resolution is not the marriage
promised to us at the fall of the curtain but the encounter of heart
and vision" (ibid., p. 58) "We are invited to follow the development of
the play in two registers, which offer us two parallel curves that are
separated, however, different in their importance, their language, and
their function: the one rapidly sketched, the other fully drawn in all its
complexity, the first letting us guess the direction that the second will
take, the second deeply echoing the first, providing its definitive
meaning. This play of interior reflections contributes to the imparting of
a rigorous and supple geometry to Marivaux's play, while at the same
time closely linking the two registers, even up to the
movements of love" (ibid., p. 59).
5o. TN. In the Phenomenology Hegel takes the reader on a "voyage of
discovery" that Hegel himself has already made. The dialectical turn
ing points of the Phenomenology are always marked by the reader's
being brought to a point where he can grasp what Hegel has already
grasped, the concept in question becoming true "for us," the distance
between subject and object having been annihilated. Hegel defines the
structure of the Phenomenology as circular, a return to its point of
departure.

of the Creator. For the universe is a simultaneity, by virtue of which
things at a remove from each other lead a concerted existence and
form a harmonic solidarity; to the metaphor that unites them corresponds, in the relations between beings, love, the link between separated souls. It is thus natural for Claudel's thought to admit that two
beings severed from each other by distance can be conjoined in their
simultaneity, henceforth resonating like two notes of a chord, like
Prouheze and Rodrigue in their inextinguishable relationship."

TN. Derrida here is specifying several characteristics of metaphysics

without demonstrating their interrelatedness. 1. "Heliocentric metaphysics" refers to the philosophical language founded on metaphors of
light and dark, e.g., truth as light, error as dark, etc. 2. This language
always implies a privileged position of "acoustics," i.e., a privilege
accorded to a phonological, spoken model of the presence of truth in
living, spoken discourse, and a concomitant abasement of the silent
work of the "force" of differentiation. This abasement is typically
revealed in the philosophical treatment of writing. 3. This system is set in
motion by Platonism, whose doctrine of the eidos implies both points
just mentioned.

paper is the reproduction of a lecture given 4 March 1963 at the
College Philosophique. In proposing that this text be published in the
Revue de metaphysique et de morale, M. Jean Wahl agreed that it should
retain its first form, that of the spoken word, with all its requirements
and, especially, its particular weaknesses: if in general, according to the
remark in the Phaedrus, the written word is deprived of "the assistance of
its father," if it is a fragile "idol" fallen from "living and animated
discourse" unable to "help itself," then is it not more exposed

In The Interpretation of Dreams (trans. and ed. James Strachey in The
Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, vol.
3.
4 London: Hogarth Press, 1955, p. 99, n.1), speaking of the link
between dreams and verbal expression, Freud recalls Ferenczi's
remark that every language has its own dream language. The latent content
of a dream (and of any behavior or consciousness in general)
communicates with the manifest content only through the unity of a
language-a language that the analyst must thus speak as well as possible. (On this subject cf. Daniel Lagache, "Sur le polyglottisme dans
('analyse," in La psychanalyse, vol. 1 [Paris: 1956], pp. 167-78.) As well as

possible: progress in the knowledge and practice of a language being by
nature infinitely open (first by virtue of the original and essential
equivocality of the signifier, at least in the language of "everyday life," its
indeterminateness and playing-space being precisely that which liberates
the difference between hidden and stated meaning; then, by virtue of the
original and essential communication between different languages
throughout history; finally, by virtue of the play, the relation to itself, or
"sedimentation," of every language), are not the insecurities and
insufficiencies of analysis axiomatic or irreducible? And does not the
historian of philosophy, whatever his method or project, abandon himself
to the same dangers? Especially if one takes into account a certain
embedding of philosophical language in nonphilosophical language.
That all history can only be, in the last analysis, the history of meaning, that
4. is, of Reason in general, is what Foucault could not fail to experience-we
shall come to this in a moment. What he could not fail to experience
is that the general meaning of a difficulty he attributes to the "classical
experience" is valid well beyond the "classical age." Cf., for example:
"And when it was a question, in seeking it in its most withdrawn
essence, of peeling it away to its last structure, we would discover, in
order to formulate it, only the very language of reason

NOTES TO PAGES 39-55 391

employed in the impeccable logic of delirium; precisely that which
made it accessible counterfeited it as madness." The very language of
reason ... but what is a language that would not be one of reason in
general? And if there is no history, except of rationality and meaning in
general, this means that philosophical language, as soon as it speaks,
reappropriates negativity-or forgets it, which is the same thingeven
when it allegedly affirms or recognizes negativity. More surely then,
perhaps. The history of truth is therefore the history of this economy of the
negative. It is necessary, and it is perhaps time to come back to the
ahistorical in a sense radically opposed to that of classical philosophy: not
to misconstrue negativity, but this time to affirm itsilently. It is
negativity and not positive truth that is the nonhistorical capital of
history. In question then would be a negativity so negative that it could
not even be called such any longer. Negativity has always been
determined by dialectics-that is to say, by metaphysics-as work in the
service of the constitution of meaning. To affirm negativity in silence is to
gain access to a nonclassical type of dissociation between thought
and language. And perhaps to a dissociation of thought and
philosophy as discourse, if we are conscious of the fact that this schism
cannot be enunciated, thereby erasing itself, except within philosophy.

to avoid confusions that could be caused by translating it as "work of

governed by institutionalized rationalism.

15. Madness, theme or index: what is significant is that Descartes, at bo tom,
never speaks of madness itself in this text. Madness is not h
epistemological value. It will be said, perhaps, that this is the sign of
profound exclusion. But this silence on madness itself simultaneousl
signifies the opposite of an exclusion, since it is not a question a
madness in this text, if only to exclude it. It is not in the Meditations tha
Descartes speaks of madness itself.
would have to specify that the expressions "sensory or corporeal fault' or
"corporeal error" could have no meaning for Descartes. There is n
corporeal error, particularly in illness: jaundice or melancholy are onl the
occasions of an error that itself is born only with the consent o
affirmation of the will in judgment, when "one who is ill with jaundic

always are as they appear to be" [Haldane and Ross, p. 441.)

22. That is to say, as soon as, more or less implicitly, Being is called upon
(even before its determination as essence and existence)-which can
only mean, to be called upon by Being. Being would not be what it is if
speech simply preceded or invoked it. Language's final protective bar
rier against madness is the meaning of Being.

24. It is a question less of a point than of a temporal originality in general.
25. TN. The reference is to Plato's Republic 5ogb-c. 26. It risks erasing the
excess by which every philosophy (of meaning) is
related, in some region of its discourse, to the nonfoundation of
unmeaning.
27. In the next to last paragraph of the sixth Meditation, the theme of
normality communicates with the theme of memory, at the moment
when the latter, moreover, is confirmed by absolute Reason as "divine
veracity," etc.
Generally speaking, does not God's confirmation of the remembrance of obvious truths signify that only the positive infinity of divine
reason can absolutely reconcile temporality and truth? In the infinite
alone, beyond all determinations, negations, "exclusions" and
"internments," is produced the reconciliation of time and thought
(truth) which Hegel claimed was the task of nineteenth-century philosophy, while the reconciliation of thought and space was to have
been the aim of the so-called "Cartesian" rationalisms. That this divine
infinity is the proper location, condition, name, or horizon of these two
reconciliations is what has never been contested by any metaphysician,
neither by Hegel, nor by the majority of those, such as Husserl, who
have attempted to think and to name the essential temporality or
historicity of truth and meaning. For Descartes, the crisis of which we
are speaking would finally have its intrinsic (that is, intellectual) origin in
time itself, as the absence of a necessary link between its parts, as the
contingency and discontinuity of the transition from instant to
instant; which supposes that here we follow all the interpretations
opposed to Laporte's on the question of the role of the instant in
Descartes's philosophy. In the last retort, only continuous creation,
uniting conservation and creation, which "differ only as concerns our
way of thinking," reconciles temporality and truth. It is God who
excludes madness and crisis, that is to say, embraces them in the

394 NOTES TO PAGES 7 0 - 7 1
presence that encompasses all traces and differences. Which amounts to
saying that crisis, anomaly, negativity, etc. are irreducible within the
experience of finitude, or of a finite moment, a determination of absolute
reason, or of reason in general. To attempt to deny this, and allegedly
to affirm positivity (the positivity of truth, meaning, norms, etc.) outside
the horizon of this infinite reason (reason in general, beyond all its
specific determinations), is to attempt to erase negativity, and is to forget
finitude at the very moment when one allegedly denounces as
mystification the theologism of the great classical
rationalisms.
28. But God is the other name of the absolute of reason itself, of reason and
meaning in general. And what could exclude, reduce, oramounting to
the same thing-absolutely embrace madness, if not reason in general,
absolute and undetermined reason, whose other name is God, for the
classical rationalists? One cannot accuse those, individuals or societies,
who use God as a recourse against madness of seeking to shelter
themselves, to be sure of having protections against madness-the safe
boundaries of asylums-except by construing this shelter as a f i n i t e one,
within the world, by making God a third party or finite power, that is,
except by deceiving oneself; by deceiving oneself not concerning the
content and effective finality of this gesture in history, but concerning the
philosophical specificity of the idea and name of God. If philosophy has
taken place-which can always be contested-it is only in the extent to
which it has formulated the aim of thinking beyond the finite shelter. By
describing the historical constitution of these finite protective barriers
against madness within the movement of individuals, societies and all
finite totalities in general-a legitimate, immense, and necessary taskone can finally describe everything except the philosophical project itself.
And except the project of this description itself. One cannot allege that the
philo
sophical project of the "infinitivist" rationalisms served as an instru
ment or as an alibi for a finite historico-politico-social violence (which
is doubtless the case) without first having to acknowledge and respect
the intentional meaning of this project itself. Now, within its own
intentional meaning, this project presents itself as the conceptualiza
tion of the infinite, that is, of that which cannot be exhausted by any
finite totality, by any function or by any instrumental, technical, or
political determination. It will be said that this presentation of the
philosophical project by itself as such is its greatest lie, its violence

and its mystification-or, further, its bad faith. And, certainly, the

NOTES TO PAGES 71-81 395

structure which links this intention to exceed the world to the totality of
history must be described rigorously, and its economy must be
determined. But like all ruses, these economic ones are possible only for
finite words and finite intentions, substituting one finitude for another.
One cannot lie when one says nothing (that is finite or determined), or
when one says God, Being, or Nothingness, or when one does not
modify the finite by the declared meaning ofone's words, or when one
says the infinite, that is, when one lets the infinite (God, Being, or
Nothingness, for part of the meaning of the infinite is its inability to be
an ontic determination among others) be said and conceived. The theme
of divine veracity and the difference between God and the evil genius are
thus illuminated by a light which is only apparently indirect.
In short, Descartes knew that, without God, finite thought never had the
right to exclude madness, etc. Which amounts to saying that madness is
never excluded, except in fact, violently, in history; or rather that this
exclusion, this difference between the fact and the principle is historicity,
the possibility of history itself. Does Foucault say otherwise? "The
necessity of madness ... is linked to the possibility of history"
(author's italics).

of "Structure, Sign, and Play," this vol, chap. 1o. The "rabbinical"
interpretation of interpretation is the one which seeks a final truth,
which sees interpretation as an unfortunately necessary road back to an
original truth. The "poetical" interpretation of interpretation does not
seek truth or origin, but affirms the play of interpretation.

the unhappy consciousness was Abraham.

Emmanuel Levinas appeared: "La trace de I'autre", in Tydschrj voor
Filosofie, September 1963; and "La signification et le sens," Revue de
metaphysique et de morale, 1964, no. 2. Unfortunately we can make but brief
allusions to these texts here. [The major work referred to in this essay
has appeared in English: Totality and Infinity, trans. Alphonso Lingis
(Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969). All page references to TI

2. TN. On the double genitive cf. above, chap. 3, note 11.

3. After desiring to restore the properly ontological intention dormant
within metaphysics, after having reawakened the "fundamental ontology"
beneath "metaphysical ontology," Heidegger, faced by the tenacity of
traditional ambiguity, finally proposes to abandon the terms "ontology"
and "ontological" (Introduction to Metaphysics). The question of Being
cannot be submitted to an ontology.
4. That is, to relativism: the truth of philosophy does not depend upon its
relation to the actuality of the Greek or European event. On the contrary,
we must gain access to the Greek or European eidos through an irruption
or a call whose point of departure is variously determined by Husserl
and Heidegger. It remains that, for both, "the irruption of philosophy"
("Aufbruch oder Einbruch der Philosophie," Husserl, Krisis ...) is the
"original" phenomenon which characterizes Europe as a "spiritual figure"
(ibid.). For both, the "word philosophia tells us that philosophy is
something which, first of all, determines the existence of the Greek world.
Not only that-philosophic also determines the innermost basic feature
of our Western-European history, the often heard expression 'WesternEuropean philosophy' is, in truth, a tautology. Why? Because philosophy
is Greek in its nature; Greek, in this instance, means that in origin the
nature of philosophy is of such a kind that it first appropriated the
Greek world, and only it, in order to unfold." Heidegger, What Is
Philosophy?, trans. William Kluback and
Jean T. Wilde (London: Vision Press, 1958), PP. 29-31.
5. Husserl: "Reason does not suffer being distinguished into 'theoretical,'
'practical,' or 'esthetic,' etc." (Verite et liberte, trans. P. Ricoeur).
Heidegger: "Terms such as 'logic,' 'ethics,' 'physics,' appear only at the
moment when original thinking loses its hold" (Brief fiber den
"Humanismus," in Wegmerken [Frankfurt, 1967], p. 147).
6. TN. Lingis's note, TI, p. 24: "With the author's permission, we are
translating 'autrui' (the personal Other, the you) by 'Other,' and 'autre' by
'other.' In doing so, we regrettably sacrifice the possibility of reproducing
the author's use of capital or small letters with both these terms in the
French text." I have followed Lingis's practice throughout this text.
7. Partial not only due to the point of view chosen, the amplitude of the
works, the material and other limits of this essay. But also because
Levinas's writing, which would merit an entire separate study itself, and
in which stylistic gestures (especially in Totality and Infinity) can less
than ever be distinguished from intention, forbids the prosaic
disembodiment into conceptual frameworks that is the first violence

Husserl, who is already showing such care in respecting the originality of
the meaning of the reduction, it is true that in 1930, and in his published works, Husserl had not yet made it into a theme. We will come
back to this. For the moment we are not interested in Husserlian truth,
but in Levinas's itinerary.
As concerns representation, an important motif in the divergence, as
however, never seems to have stopped hesitating. But again, almost
too between law and fact. This movement can be followed through the
following passages: THI, pp. 9off.; EDE, pp. 22-23, esp. p. 52;

In EDE, at a time (1940-49) when the surprises in this area were no
longer held in store, the theme of this criticism still will be central: "In
history." (We do not mean to say, here, that this sentence is f i n a l l y in
contradiction with Husserl's then known intentions. But are not the
latter, whatever the definitive heart of the matter, already more prob
lematical than Levinas seems to believe?)
18. TN. The reference is to the structure of Being-with analyzed in Being

keep to the practice of translating Sein by "Being," and Seiendes by
"being," I shall most often use "existent" for "being" (Seiendes, etant)
throughout this essay in order to have my vocabulary conform to Levinas's. "Existent" has been maintained in the English translation of

Totality and Infinity.
20. Hegel himself would not escape the rule. Contradiction would be
here would be to turn the accusation of formalism against Hegel, and to
denounce speculative reflection as a logic of understanding, as
tautological. One can imagine the difficulty of the task.
21. Another discomfort: Levinas never simply condemns technology. It can
rescue from a worse violence, the "reactionary" violence of sacred
ravishment, of taking root, of the natural proximity of landscape.
"Technology takes us out of the Heideggerean world and the superstitions
of Place." It offers the chance "to let the human face shine in its nudity"
(DL). We will return to this. Here, we only wish to foreshadow that within
history-but is it meaningful elsewhere?-every philosophy of nonviolence can
only choose the lesser violence within an economy of violence.
22. TN. The reference is to the dialectic of the master and the slave in
The Phenomenology of the Mind: the master enjoys and consumes the

product of the slave's work. The slave defers this enjoyment in the:

25. Among the numerous passages denouncing the impotence of so'
called "formal logic" when confronted with naked experience, let us'
point out in particular TI, pp. 194, 260, 276, where the description of

this nature? Had it not, rather, welcomed them?)
26. An affirmation at once profoundly faithful to Kant ("Respect is applied,
only to persons"-Practical Reason) and implicitly anti-Kantian, for
without the formal element of universality, without the pure order

of

the law, respect for the other, respect and the other no longer escape

empirical and pathological immediacy. Nevertheless, how do they
escape according to Levinas? It is perhaps to be regretted that no
systematic and patient confrontation has been organized with Kant in
particular. To our knowledge, only an allusion is made to the "Kantian
echos," and "to Kant's practical philosophy to which we feel particularly
close,"-and this barely in passing-in one article ("L'ontologie est-elle
fondamentale?" Revue de metaphysique et de morale 1951; reprinted in
Ph9nomtnologie, Existence.) This confrontation is called for not only
because of the ethical themes but also because of the difference
between totality and infinity, about which Kant, among others and
perhaps more than others, had a number of thoughts.
27. Levinas often makes accusations against the Socratic mastery which
teaches nothing, teaches only the already known, and makes everything
arise from the self, that is from the Ego, or from the Same as Memory.
Anamnesis too, would be a procession of the Same. On this point, at least,
Levinas cannot oppose himself to Kierkegaard (cf., for example, J. Wahl,
Etudes Kierkegaardiennes, pp. 308-9), for his critique of Platonism here is
literally Kierkegaardian. It is true that Kierkegaard opposed Socrates to
Plato each time that reminiscence was in question. The latter would
belong to the Platonic "speculation" from which Socrates "separates"
himself (Post scriptum).

movement of temporalization.
37. While defending himself against "the ridiculous pretension of'correcting'
Buber" (TI), Levinas, in substance, reproaches the I-Thou rela
tionship (1) for being reciprocal and symmetrical, thus committing
violence against height, and especially against separateness, and

402 NOTES TO PAGES 1 3 1 - 3 6
secretiveness; (2) for being formal, capable of "uniting man to things,
as much as Man to man" (TI); (3) for preferring preference, the "private
relationship," the "clandestine nature" of the couple which is "selfsufficient and forgetful of the universe" (TI). For there is also in Levinas's
thought, despite his protests against neutrality, a summoning of the third
party, the universal witness, the face of the world which keeps us from
the "disdainful spiritualism" of the I-Thou. Others will determine,
perhaps, whether Buber would recognize himself in this interpretation. It
can already be noted in passing that Buber seems to have foreseen these
reservations. Did he not specify that the I-Thou relationship was neither
referential nor exclusive in that it is previous to all empirical and eventual
modifications? Founded by the absolute IThou, which turns us toward
God, it opens up, on the contrary, the possibility of every relationship
to Others. Understood in its original authenticity, it is neither detour
nor diversion. Like many of the contradictions which have been used to
embarrass Buber, this one yields, as the Postscript to I-Thou tells us, "to a
superior level of judgment" and to "the paradoxical description of God as
the absolute Person .... It is as the absolute Person that God enters into
a direct relation with us .... The man who turns to him therefore need not
turn away from any other I-Thou relation; but he properly brings them to
him, and lets them be fulfilled 'in the face of God' " (I and Thou, trans.
Ronald Gregor Smith, New York: Scribner's, 1958).
38. On the theme of the height of God in its relation to the prone position
of child or man (for example, on his sick bed or deathbed), on the
relations between the clinic and theology, cf., for example, Feuerbach (see
39 note 33 above), p. 233.
Here we ought to examine Malebranche too grappling with the problem
40. of light and of the face of God (cf. especially Loth Eclaircissement). We
will not go beyond this schema. It would be useless to attempt, here,
to enter into the descriptions devoted to interiority, economy,
enjoyment, habitation, femininity, Eros, to everything suggested under the
title Beyond the Face, matters that would doubtless deserve many
questions. These analyses are not only an indefatiguable and
free as concerns traditional conceptuality, that a commentary running
several pages would betray them immeasurably. Let it suffice to state
that they depend upon the conceptual matrix we have just outlined,
without being deduced from it but ceaselessly regenerating it. On these

front Hegel and Levinas, cf. notably Jean Hyppolite, Genese et structure de
la phenomEnologie de ('esprit, 1:147ff.; and Heidegger, Identity and Difference.
Here we are thinking of the distinction between discourse and violence
particularly common to Levinas and to Eric Weil. It does not have the same
meaning for both. Levinas notes this in passing and, while paying
homage to Weil for his "systematic and vigorous use of the term
violence in its opposition to discourse," claims to give "different
meaning" to this distinction (DL). We would be tempted to give a
diametrically opposed meaning. The discourse which Weil acknowledges as nonviolent is ontology, the project of ontology. (Cf. Logique de
la philosophie, e.g., pp. 28ff. "La naissance de I'ontologie, le discours.")
"Harmony between men will be established by itself if men are not
concerned with themselves, but with what is;" its polarity is infinite
coherence, and its style, at least, is Hegelian. This coherence in ontology
is violence itself for Levinas: the "end of history" is not absolute Logic, the
absolute coherence of the Logos with itself in itself; nor is it harmony in
the absolute System, but Peace in separation, the diaspora of
absolutes. Inversely, is not peaceful discourse, according to Levinas, the
discourse which respects separation and rejects the horizon of
ontological coherence, violence itself for Weil? Let us schematize:
according to Weil, violence will be, or rather would be, reduced only
with the reduction of alterity, or the will to alterity. The reverse is true
for Levinas. But for Levinas coherence is always finite (totality, in the
meaning he gives to the word, rejecting any possible meaning for the
notion of infinite totality). For Weil, it is the notion of alterity, on the
contrary, which implies irreducible finitude. But for both, only the
infinite is nonviolent, and it can be announced only in discourse. One
should examine the common presuppositions of this convergence and
divergence. One should ask whether the predetermination, common to
these two systems, of violation and of pure logos, and, above all, the
predetermination of their incompatability, refers to an absolute truth, or
perhaps to an epoch of the history of thought, the history of Being. Let
us note that Bataille too, in Eroticism, draws inspiration from Weil's
concepts, and states this explicitly. TN. Derrida is playing on the double
sense of regard as ethical concern and as objectifying glance. Cf. note 1 o
above. At bottom, it is the very notion of a "constitution of an alter
ego" to which Levinas refuses any merit. He would probably say, with
43.
44. Sartre, "One encounters the Other, one does not constitute it" (Being
and

404 NOTES TO PAGES 1 5 4 - 6 1
Nothingness). This is to understand the word "constitution" in a sense that
Husserl often warns his reader against. Constitution is not opposed to
encounter. It goes without saying that constitution creates, constructs,
engenders, nothing: neither existence, nor the fact, which is evident, nor
even meaning, which is less evident but equally certain, provided that one
takes some patient precautions, and provided that one distinguishes
the moments of passivity and activity within intuition, in Husserl's
sense, and the moment in which the distinction becomes impossible.
That is, in which the entire problematic opposing "encounter" to
"constitution" is no longer meaningful, or has only a derivative and
dependent meaning. Unable to enter into these difficulties here, let us
simply recall this warning of Husserl's, among so many others: "Here too,
as concerns the alter ego, the 'constitution of consciousness'
(Bewusstseinleistung) does not mean that I invent (erfinde) and that I
make (mache) this supreme transcendence." (In question is God.)
Inversely, does not the notion of encounter-a notion to which one
must refer, if one rejects all constitution, in the Husserlian sense of the
term-aside from being prey to empiricism, let it be understood that
there is a time and an experience without "other" before the
encounter? The difficulties into which one is driven can be imagined.
Husserl's philosophical prudence on this matter is exemplary. The
Cartesian Meditations often emphasize that in fact, really, nothing precedes the experience of Others.
Or at least cannot be, or be anything; and it is indeed the authority of
Being which Levinas profoundly questions. That his discourse must still
submit to the contested agency is a necessity whose rule we must attempt
45.
to inscribe systematically in the text. This connaturality of discourse and
of violence does not appear to us to have emerged in history, nor to be
tied to a given form of communication, or again to a given
46. "philosophy." We wish to show here that this connaturality belongs to
the very essence of history, to transcendental historicity, a notion which
here can only be understood in the resonance of a speech common-in a
way that still calls for clarification-to Hegel, Husserl, and Heidegger.
Historical or ethnosociological information here can only confirm or
support, under the rubric of the factual example, the eidetictranscendental evidence. Even if this information is manipulated
(gathered, described, explicated) with the greatest philosophical or
methodological prudence, that is, even if it is articulated correctly with

NOTES TOPAGES 161-70 405

the essential reading, and if it respects all levels of eidetic generality, in no
case could it found or demonstrate any necessity of essence. For example,
we are not sure that these technical, as well as transcendental
precautions are taken by Claude Levi-Strauss when, in Tristes tropiques,
amongst many beautiful pages, he advances the "hypothesis" "that the
primary function of written communication it to facilitate servitude." If
writing-and, indeed, speech in general-retains within it an essential
violence, this cannot be "demonstrated" or "verified" on the basis of
"facts," whatever sphere they are borrowed from and even if the totality
of the "facts" in this domain were available. One can often see in the
descriptive practice of the "social sciences" the most seductive (in every
sense of the word) confusion of empirical investigation, inductive
hypothesis and intuition of essence, without any precautions as to the
origin and function of the propositions advanced.

existenthood, which Heidegger also calls the truth of Being.

64. In the same problematical horizon, one may confront Heidegger's
procedures (for example, in the introduction to Metaphysics, "On the
Grammar and Etymology of the Word 'Being' ") with Benveniste's ("Etre
et avoir clans leurs fonctions linguistiques," in ProblBmes de linguistique

g9nr role).
65. Here we could refer to a hundred passages from Heidegger. Rather, let us
cite Levinas, who had written, however: "For Heidegger, the comprehension of Being is not a purely theoretical act . an act of knowledge
like any other" (EDE).
66. It is not necessary to return to the pre-Socratics here. Aristotle already
had rigorously demonstrated that Being is neither genre nor principle. (Cf.
for example, Metaphysics B, 3, 998 b 20). Does not this demonstration,
made at the same time as a critique of Plato, in truth confirm one of the
Sophist's intentions? There, Being was certainly defined as one of the
"largest genres," and as the most universal of predicates, but also as
that which permits all predication in general. As the origin and possibility
of predication, it is not a predicate, not, at least, a predicate like any
other, but a transcendental or transcategorical predicate. Further, the
S oph is t- a nd this is its theme-teaches us to think that Being-which
is other than the other and other the same, is the same as itself, and is
implied by all genres to the extent that they are-far from closing
difference, on the contrary liberates it, and itself is what it is only by this
liberation.

68. The essential relations between the same and the other (difference)
are such that even the hypothesis of a subsumption of the other by the
same-violence, according to Levinas-has no meaning. The same is
not a category, but the possibility of every category. Here, we should
attentively compare Levinas's theses with Heidegger's text entitled
Identity and Difference (1957). For Levinas, the same is the concept,
just as Being and unity are concepts, and these three concepts
immediately communicate among each other (cf. TI p. 274, for
example). For Heidegger, the same is not the identical (cf. Humanis
mus, for example). And, mainly, because it is not a category. The
same
is not the negation of difference, nor is Being.

70. In his very fine study, H e i d e g g e r et la penste de la finitude, Henri Birault
shows how the theme of Endlichkeit is progressively abandoned by
Heidegger, for "the same reason which had motivated its use at a cer
tain time" due to "concern for separating from the thought of Being
not only the survivals and metamorphoses of Christian theology, but still
the theological itself, which is absolutely constitutive of metaphysics as
such. In effect, if the Heideggerean concept of Endlichkeit was never the
Christian-theological concept of finitude, it nevertheless remains that
the idea of finite Being is in itself ontologically theological and, as such, is
incapable of satisfying a thought which draws back from Metaphysics
only to meditate, in the light of the forgotten truth of Being, the still
hidden unity of its onto-theological essence" (Revue internationale de
philosophie, 1g6o, no. 52). A thought which seeks to go to its very end in
its language, to the end of what it envisages under the name of original
finitude or finitude of Being, therefore should abandon not only the
words and themes of the finite and the infinite, but also, which is
doubtless impossible, everything that they govern in language, in the
deepest sense of the word. This last impossibility does not signify that
the beyond of metaphysics is impracticable; on the contrary, it confirms
the necessity for this incommensurable overflow to take support from
metaphysics. A necessity clearly recognized by Heidegger. Indeed, it
marks that only difference is fundamental, and that Being is nothing
outside the existent. "Liberte et commandement," Revue de mItaphysique

las of Cusa says: "The creature comes from God, yet it cannot, in
consequence of that, add anything to Him who is the Maximum
[Being]. How are we going to be able to form an idea of creature as
such?" And in order to illustrate "the double process of envelopment
and development" "whose mode is absolutely unknown," he writes: "It
is as if a face were reproduced in its own image. With multiplication of the
image we get distant and close reproductions of the face. (I do not mean
distance in space but a gradual distance from the true face, since
without that multiplication would be impossible.) In the many different
images of that face one face would appear in many, different ways, but it
would be an appearance that the senses would be incapable of
recognizing and the mind of understanding." Of Learned Ignorance, trans.

78. The thought of Being is what permits us to say, without naivete, reduction,
or blasphemy, "God, for example." That is, to think God as what he is
without making an object of him. This is what Levinas, here in
agreement with all the most classical infinist metaphysics, would
judge to be impossible, absurd, or purely verbal: how to think what one
says when one proposes the expression, God-or the infinite for example? But
the notion of exemplariness would offer more than one piece of
resistance to this objection.
79. In a violent article (Heidegger, Gagarine et noun in Djcile liberte,
Heidegger is designated as the enemy of technology and classed
among the "enemies of industrial society," who "most often are
reactionaries." This is an accusation to which Heidegger has so frequently
and so clearly responded that we can do no better than to refer to his
writings, in particular to La question de la technique, which treats
technology as a "mode of unveiling" (in"Essais et conferences), to the Letter
on Humanism, and to the Introduction to Metaphysics (The Limitation of
Being), where a certain violence, of which we will speak in a moment, is
linked in a nonpejorative and nonethical way to technology in the
unveiling of Being (dainon-techne).
In any event, we can see the specificity of the accusation made by
Levinas. Being (as concept) would be the violence of the neutral. The

sacred would be the neutralization of the personal God. The "reaction"
against technology would not have as its target the danger of technical
depersonalization, but precisely that which liberates from ravishment by
the Sacred and implantation in the Site.
8o. Since we cannot unfold this debate here, we will refer to the clearest of
Heideggei s texts on this point: (a) Sein and Zeit: the themes ofessential
Unheimlichkeit, of the "nudity" of being-in-the-world, "als Unzuhause."
It is precisely this authentic condition that the neutral existence of the One
flees from. (b) Humanismus: concerning Holderlin's poem Return,
Heidegger notes that in his commentary the word "country" is "thought
in an essential sense, not at all a patriotic sense, nor a nationalist
sense, but rather, from the point of view of the History of Being." (c)
In the same location, Heidegger writes in particular: "On the metaphysical
plane, every nationalism is an anthropologism, and as such, a
subjectivism. Nationalism is not overcome by pure internationalism, but
is rather enlarged and Set up as a system." (d) Finally, as concerns the
dwelling and the home (whose praises Levinas also understands
himself to sing, but, it is true, as a moment of interiority, and precisely
as economy), Heidegger indeed specifies that the home does not
metaphorically determine Being on the basis of its economy but, on the
contrary, can only be determined as such on the basis of the essence of
Being. Cf. also ... L'homme habite en poete, in which, let us note in
passing, Heidegger distinguishes the Same and the Equal (dos Selbedas Gleiche): "The Same sets to one side any haste to resolve differences in
the Equal," in Essais et conferences.
81. Cf., for example, Erlauterungen zu Holderlins Dichtung (Frankfurt,
1963), P. 14.
82. Ibid.
83. Ibid., p. 27.
84. Cf. also Vom Wesen des Grundes. Theology, the thinking of the existentGod,
of the essence and existence of God, thus would suppose the thinking
of Being. Here we need not refer to Heidegger in order to understand
this movement, but first to Duns Scotus, to whom Heidegger had
devoted one of his first writings, as is well known. For Duns Scotus, the
thought of common and uniform Being is necessarily prior to the
thought of the determined existent (determined, for example, as finite
or infinite, created or uncreated, etc.). Which does not mean:
First, that common and uniform Being is a genre, and that Duns
Scotus revives the Aristotelian demonstration without nevertheless

410

NOTES TO PAGES 1 8 2 - 8 6

referring to the analogy. (On this subject, cf. notably Etienne Gilson,
Jean Duns Scot, Introduction d ses positions fondamentales, pp. 104-5.)
Second, that the doctrine of the uniformity of Being is incompatible
with the Aristotelian-Thomist doctrine and with the analogy which, as
Gilson shows (ibid., pp. 84-115), is situated on another plane, and

between Levinas and Heidegger-"is therefore posed on a terrain,
order to penetrate it, one must first have emerged from the dilemma '
imposed by Aristotelianism between the universal and the singular, the
'first' and the 'second,' and thereby have escaped the necessity of
choosing between the analogous and the uniform, which can only be
accomplished by isolating a notion of Being in some way metaphysically
pure of all determination" (ibid., p. 89). It follows that if the thought
of Being (which Gilson, differing from Heidegger, here calls;
"metaphysics") is implied in all theology, it does not precede it, or
govern it in any way, as would a principle or a concept. The relations of
85. Sartre, like Levinas, had earlier interpreted the Mitsein in the sense of

Le concept du monde chez Heidegger. In this work, Walter Biemel, with
much precision and clarity, confronts this interpretation with
Heidegger's intentions (pp. golf). Let us add simply that the w i t h of
the Mitsein originally no more denotes the structure of a team animated
mated by a neutral common task than does the w i t h of the "language
w i t h God" (TI). The Being which can interpellate the Mitsein is not, as
Levinas often gives us to understand, a third term, a common truth,
etc. Finally, the notion of Mitsein describes an original structure of the
meaning of "encounter" or of "constitution," that is, to the debate
which we mentioned above. (Cf. also Being and Time: "With and also must
be understood as existentiales and not as categories.")
86. Cf. Introduction to Metaphysics (especially "The Limitation of Being").
87. We must specify here, that "ontology" does not refer to the concept of
ontology which Heidegger proposes to renounce (cf. above [note 4]),
but to the unfindable expression by which it must be replaced. The
word "historical" also must be modified in order to be understood in
consonance with the word "ontological," ofwhich it is not an attribute,
and in relation to which it marks no derivation.

in France as the author of Hegel and der Stoat than of Der Stern der
Erldsung (The Star of Redemption, 1921). Rosenzweig's influence on
Levinas seems to have been profound. "We were impressed by the
opposition to the idea of totality in Franz Rosenzweig's Stern der Erl

9o. In his Exposition of Philosophical Empiricism Schelling wrote: "Thus God
would be Being enclosed in itself in an absolute manner, would be
substance in the most elevated sense, free of every relation. But f r o m
the very fact that we consider these determinations as purely imma
nent, as relating to nothing external, one finds oneself in the necessity
of having to conceive them by parting from H i m , that is, to conceive
him as the prius, that is as the absolute prius. And it is thus that,
pushed to its final consequences, empiricism leads us to the supra
empirical." Naturally, by "enclosed" and "enfolded" one is not to
understand finite closure and egoistic muteness, but rather absolute
alterity, what Levinas calls the Infinite absolved of relation. An analogous
movement is outlined in Bergson, who, in his Introduction to
Metaphysics, criticizes the empiricist doctrines unfaithful to pure
experience in the name of true empiricism, and concludes: "This true
empiricism is the true metaphysics." Pure difference is not absolutely
91. different (from nondifference). Hegel's critique of the concept of pure
difference is for us here, doubtless, the most uncircumventable theme.
Hegel thought absolute difference, and showed that it can be pure
only by being impure. In the Science of Logic, as concerns Absolute
Difference, Hegel writes, for example: "This difference is difference inand-for-itself, absolute difference, the difference of Essence. It is
difference in-and-for-itself not by the effect of an external cause, but a
difference in relation to itself, thus a simple difference. It is essential to
see in absolute difference a simple difference ... Difference in itself is
difference in relation to itself; thus it is its own negativity, difference not
in relation to an other, but in relation to itself ... What differentiates
difference is identity. Difference, thus, is both itself and identity.
Both together make

412 NOTES TO PAGE 192
difference; difference is both the All and its own moment. It can just as
much be said that difference, as simple, is not difference at all; it is
such first in relation to identity; but as such, difference contains both
itself and this relationship. Difference is the All and its own moment,
just as identity is the All and its own moment" (Wissenschaft der Logik,
[Leipzig 0 J], 2:48 -49).
92. James Joyce, Ulysses; p. 622 But Levinas does not care for Ulysses, nor for
the ruses of this excessively Hegelian hero, this man of nostos and the
closed circle, whose adventure is always summarized in its totality. Levinas
often reproaches him. "To the myth of Ulysses returning to Ithaca, we
would prefer to oppose the story of Abraham leaving his country forever
for an as yet unknown land, and forbidding his servant to take back even
his son to the point of departure" (La trace d e I'autre). The impossibility
of the return doubtless was not overlooked by Heidegger: the original
historicity of Being, the originality of difference, and irreducible
wandering all forbid the return to Being itself which is nothing.
Therefore, Levinas here is in agreement with Heidegger. Inversely, is
the theme of the return as unhebraic as all that? While constructing
Bloom and Stephen (Saint Stephen, the Hellenic-Jew), Joyce took great
interest in the theses of Victor Berard, who saw Ulysses as a Semite. It is
true that "Jewgreek is greekjew" is a neutral proposition, anonymous in the
sense execrated by Levinas, inscribed in Lynch's headpiece. "Language of
no one," Levinas would say. Moreover, it is attributed to what is called
"feminine logic": "Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew." On this
subject, let us note in passing that Totality and Infinity pushes the respect
for dissymmetry so far that it seems to us impossible, essentially
impossible, that it could have been written by a woman. Its philosophical
subject is man (vir). (Cf., for example, the Phenomenology of Eros, which
occupies such an important place in the book's economy.) Is not this
principled impossibility for a book to have been written by a woman unique
in the history of metaphysical writing? Levinas acknowledges elsewhere
that femininity is an "ontological category." Should this remark be placed
in relation to the essential virility of metaphysical language? But perhaps
metaphysical desire is essentially virile, even in what is called woman. It
appears that this is what Freud (who would have misconstrued
sexuality as the "relationship with what is absolutely other,"
TI), thought, not of desire, certainly, but of libido.

3. Husserl says at this time that it is a question of, "preparing by a
series of 'psychological and logical researches' the scientific foundations
for a future structure on which to erect mathematics and philosophy"
(Philosophie der Arithmetik, Husserliana, vol. 12 [The Hague, 1970] P. 5). In
the Logische Untersuchungen he writes: "I set out from an absolute
conviction that, like logic in general, the logic of deductive science awaited
its philosophical clarification from psychology (ibid., vol. 1, p. vi). And an
article written shortly after the Philosophic der Arithmetik, Husserl asserts
again: "I believe it possible to maintain that no theory of judgment will
ever be in agreement with the facts if it is not based upon a profound
study of the descriptive and genetic relations between intuitions and
representations" ("Psychologische Studien zur elementaren Logik,"
Philosophische Monatshefte 33 [Berlin, 1894]: 187 (my italics).
4. The Philosophie derArithmetik is dedicated to Brentano.
5. Speaking of the attempt made in Philosophie der Arithmetik, Husserl
notes, in the preface to the Logische Untersuchungen: "Correspondingly,
the psychological researches occupy a very large place in the first (and only
published) volume of my philosophy of arithmetic. This psychological
foundation never seemed to me to suffice for certain developments.
Whenever it was a question of the origin of mathematical determinations,
or of the in fact psychologically determined shaping of practical
methods, the results of psychological analysis appeared to me to be
clear and instructive. But as soon as the transition from the
psychological developments of thought to the logical unity of the
content of thought (the unity of theory) was made, no real continuity or
clarity was apparent" (ibid., vol. 1, p. vii).
6. Husserl writes: "I do not understand how he [Dilthey] believes that he has
gained decisive grounds against skepticism on the basis of his very
instructive analysis of the structure and typology of Weltanschauungen"
(Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft [Frankfurt 1965], p. 53). Naturally,
historicism is condemned only to the extent that it is necessarily tied to an
empirical history, to a history as Tatsachenwissenschaft. "H istory, the
empirical science of the mind in general, is incapable of deciding by its own
means whether or not religion should be distinguished

NOTES TO PAGES 2 00 - 3

as a particular form of culture from religion as idea, that is, as valid
religion; or whether art should be distinguished as a form of culture
from valid art, historical right f rom valid right, and finally, if philosophy in
the historical sense should be distinguished from valid philosophy"
(ibid.).

schaft. Cf. Phdnomenologische Psychologie: Vorlesungen Sommersemester,

9. Speaking of the feeling of power which can ensure historical relativ
ism, Husserl writes: "We insist upon the fact that the principles of
such relative evaluations belong to the ideal sphere, and that the historian who evaluates, and does not only seek to understand pure_
developments [of facts], can only presuppose, but cannot, as a histor. ian,
ensure their foundation. The norm of mathematics is found in the
mathematical, that of logic in the logical, that of ethics in the ethical,

etc." (Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft, p. 54)
io. "Wisdom or Weltanschauung... belong to the cultural community and
to the times, and in relation to its most pronounced forms there is a
and Weltanschauung, but of an entire epoch's." It is this wisdom, Hus
serl continues, which gives "the relatively most perfect answer to the
tory clarification, in the best possible way, of the theoretical, axio
logical, and practical disagreements of life, which experience, wisdom, and
the pure apprehension of life and the world can resolve only
imperfectly" (Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft, pp. 58-59). "In the
urgency of life, in the practical necessity to take a position, man cannot:
await-perhaps for millennia-that science be there, supposing that he
already knows the idea of rigorous science" (ibid., p. 64).

tial generic nature of the domain of geometry, and in relation thereto the
pure essential nature of space, is so ordered that geometry can be fully
certain of being able to control with exact precision, through its method,
really all the possible cases. In other words, the variety of spatial
formations generally has a remarkable logical basic property, to indicate
which we introduce the name 'definite' manifold or'rnathemat ical manifold
in the pregnant sense of the term.' It has the following distinctive
feature, that a finite number of concepts and propositions .. . determines
completely and unambiguously on lines of pure logical necessity the totality of
all possible formations in the domain, so that in principle, therefore,
nothing further remains open within it" (ibid., sec. 72, p. 204).

17. In the paragraph devoted to hyle and morphe Husserl writes, most notably,
"At the level of discussion to which we have so far been limited,
which stops short of descending into the obscure depths of the
ultimate consciousness which constitutes the whole scheme of
intentional experience" (ibid., p. 246). Further on: "At all events, in the
whole phenomenological domain (in the whole, that is, within the
stage of constituted temporality, as must always be borne in mind),
this remarkable duality and unity of sensile hyle and intentional morphe
plays a dominant part" (p. 247). Previously, after having compared the
spatial and temporal dimensions of the hyle Husserl indicated, while
justifying them, the limits of static description and the necessity of
making the transition to genetic description: "For the rest, as will be
apparent in the light of the studies to be undertaken later, Time is the
name for a completely self-contained sphere of problems and one of
exceptional difficulty. It will be seen that in a certain sense our previous
exposition has been silent, and necessarily so, concerning a whole
dimension, so as to maintain free of confusion what first becomes
transparent from the phenomenological standpoint alone ... The
transcendental 'Absolute' which we have laid bare through the reductions
is in truth not ultimate; it is something which in a certain profound
and wholly unique sense constitutes itself, and has its primeval source
[Urquelle] in what is ultimately and truly absolute" (ibid., p. 236). Will
this limitation ever disappear in the works elaborated later? One
encounters reservations of this type in all the great later books,
particularly in Erfahrung and Urteil (pp. 72, 116, 194, etc.) and every time
that a "transcendental aesthetic" is announced

(Conclusion of Formale and transzendentale Logik and Cartesian Meditations, see. 61).
18. Notably this is the project of Kohler, for whom psychology must surrender to "phenomenological description," and of Koffka, a disciple of
Husserl who seeks to show, in his Principles of Gestalt Psychology, that the
"psychology of form" escapes the criticism of psychologism by means
of its structuralism.
The conjunction of phenomenology and the "psychology of form"
was readily foreseeable. Not at the moment when Husserl had to
"return" to the "notion of 'configuration' and even of Gestalt" in the
Crisis, as Merleau-Ponty suggests (Phenomenologie de la perception, p. 62, n.
1), but, on the contrary, because Husserl always alleged, and with some
justification, that Gestaltpsychologie borrowed his own concepts,
particularly the concept of "motivation" (cf. Ideas, sec. 47, and Cartesian
Meditations, sec. 37) which had already appeared in the Logische
Untersuchungen, and the concept of an organized totality, the unified
plurality, already present in Philosophie der Arithmetik (1887-91).
Concerning all these questions we refer to A. Gurwitsch's important work

Theorie du champ de la conscience.
19. (Halle, 1913), pp. 564ff.
20. "Since the monadically concrete ego includes also the whole of actual and
potential conscious life, it is clear that the problem of explicating this
monadic ego phenomenologically (the problem of his constitution for
himself) must include all constitutional problems without exception.
Consequently, the phenomenology of this self-constitution coincides with
phenomenology as a whole." (Cartesian Meditations, trans. Dorian Cairns
[The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1g6o], see. 33, p. 68).
21. "Now, however, we must call attention to a great gap in our exposition. The
ego is himself existent for himself in continuous evidence; thus, in himself,
he is continuously constituting himself as existing. Heretofore we have
touched on only one side of this self-constitution, we have looked at only
the flowing cogito. The ego grasps himself not only as a flowing life but
also as I, who live this and that subjective process, who live through
this and that cogito as the same I. Since we were busied up to now with the
intentional relation of consciousness to object, cogito to cogitatum ..."
etc. (ibid., p. 66).
22. "Access to the ultimate universalities involved in problems of eidetic
phenomenology is, however, very difficult. This is particularly true with
respect to an ultimate genesis. The beginning phenomenologist is bound
involuntarily by the circumstance that he takes himself as his

initial example. Transcendentally he finds himself as the ego, then as
generically an ego, who already has (in conscious fashion) a world-a
world of our universally familiar ontological type, with Nature, with
culture (sciences, fine art, mechanical art and so forth), with personalities of a higher order (state, church), and the rest. The phenomenology developed at first is merely 'static'; its descriptions are
analogous to those of natural history, which concerns particular types
and, at best, arranges them in their systematic order. Questions of
universal genesis and the genetic structure of the ego in his universality,
so far as that structure is more than temporal formation, are still far
away; and, indeed, they belong to a higher level. But even when they are
raised, it is with a restriction. At first, even eidetic observation will
consider an ego as such with the restriction that a constituted world
already exists for him. This, moreover, is a necessary level; only by
laying open the law-forms of the genesis pertaining to this level can one
see the possibilities of a maximally universal eidetic phenomenology"
(ibid., pp. 76-77).

25. TN. Auto-affection refers also to Heidegger's analysis of Kant's notion of
time in Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics. As can be seen in the next
few sentences the concept of auto-affection is concerned with time as
the self-generating infinite series of present moments. Here Derrida is
beginning the important analysis of speech as that which makes truth
present. It is this analysis which will allow him to view the treatment of
writing by philosophy as an index of the similar paradoxes contained within
the notions of speech and presence. Derrida's book on Husserl, La voix
et le phenomene (Paris: P.U.F., 1967) contains an extended analysis of
speech as auto-affection.

28. These expressions from late Husserl are ordered as in Aristotelean
metaphysics, where eidos, logos, and telos determine the transition from
power to act. Certainly, like the name of God, which Husserl also calls
Entelechy, these notions are designated by a transcendental index,
and their metaphysical virtue is neutralized by phenomenological
brackets. But, of course, the possibility of this neutralization,

418 NOTES TO PAGES 209- 15
the possibility of its purity, its conditions, or its "immotivation," will
never cease to be problematical. Nor did it ever cease to be so for
Husserl himself, like the possibility of the transcendental reduction
itself. The latter maintains an essential affinity with metaphysics.

This is a pre-Hegelian concept of the relations between truth,

7. TN. This is the figure of the "beautiful soul" from the Phenomenology.
Hegel is generally considered to have been describing Novalis in his
analysis of the "beautiful soul." Derrida seems to be saying here that just
as Hegel makes Novalis an example of a transcendental structure without
considering anything in Novalis that does not participate in this
structure, so Blanchot is making an example of Artaud, inevitably
reducing to the level of error that which is particular to Artaud.
8. This affirmation, whose name is "the theater of cruelty," is pronounced
after the letters to Jacques Riviere and after the early works, but it
already governs them. "The theater of cruelty / is not the symbol of an
absent void, / or a horrifying inability to realize oneself within one's life /
as a person, / it is the affirmation / of a terrifying / and, moreover,
unavoidable necessity" (Le theatre de to cruoute, 84, nos. 5-6 [1948],
p.124). [There is no complete translation ofArtaud's work into English.

13. TN. The name ofthis essay is untranslatable because it plays on all the
meanings of souffler, some of which Derrida is about to explain. We
have chosen "spirited away" because it maintains the connections with
theft, breath (from the Latin spirare), and the multiple meanings of in-spiration. The French word for "prompter" (souffleur) might best be rendered
by the neologism "inspirator." Every use of a derivative of souffler in the
original text has been indicated in brackets.
14. The public is not to exist outside, before or after the stage of cruelty, is not
to await it, to contemplate it, or to survive it-is not even to exist as a
public at all. Whence an enigmatic and lapidary formulation, in The
Theater and Its Double, in the midst of abundant, inexhaustible
definitions of "directing," the "language of the Stage," "musical
instruments," "lighting," "costumes," etc. The problem of the public is
thereby exhausted: "The Public. First of all this theater must exist" (TD, P.
99).
15. The word appears in Nerve-Scales, CW 1:72. [In the Collected Works, the
original impouvoir which we have translated as "unpower," is translated as

16. TN. Repetition in French means both repetition and rehearsal.
17. TN. The reference to Poe's "The Purloined Letter" seems deliberate.
This story was the focus of a seminar by Jacques Lacan in which he
expounded his theory ofthe signifier, as does Derrida here.
18. TN. The excess in question may be construed as that which holds
apart and unites multiple meanings in one signifier. That a historical
system must be open at some point means that it must be founded on
something like this excess. History begins with writing.
19. With the proper precautions we could speak of Artaud's Bergsonian

vein. The continuous transition of his metaphysics of life into his
theory of Language, and his critique of the word, dictated a great
number of theoretical formulations and metaphors of energy that are
rigorously Bergsonian. Cf., in particular, OC 5:15, 18, 56, 132, 141, etc.
20. Each time that it operates within the framework that we are attempting to
restore here, Artaud's language has a precise resemblance, in its syntax
and vocabulary, to that of the young Marx. In the first of the Economic
and Political Manuscripts of 1844, the labor which produces the work and
gives it value (Verwertung) proportionately increases the de-preciation
(Entwertung) of its author. "Labor's realization is its objectification. In
the sphere of political economy this realization of labor appears as loss o f
realization for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and bondage
to it; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation" (Karl Marx, Economic
and P h i l o s o p h i c Manuscripts of 1 8 4 4 , trans. Martin Milligan [New York:
International Publishers, 1964], p. 41. This juxtaposition escapes the
realms of intellectual puttering or of historical curiosity. Its necessity will
appear later when the question of what belongs to that which we call
the metaphysics of the proper (or of alienation) is posed.
21. It goes without saying that we have deliberately abstained from anything
that could be called a "biographical reference." If it is precisely at this
point that we recall that Artaud died of cancer of the rectum, we do not
do so in order to have the exception prove the rule, but because we think
that the status (still to be found) of this remark, and of other similar
ones, must not be that of the so-called "biographical reference." The
new status-to be found-is that of the relations between existence and
the text, between these two forms of textuality and the generalized
writing within whose play they are articulated.
22. In the Preface to his Collected Works, Artaud writes: "The cane of 'The
New Revelations of Being' fell into the black cyst along with the little
sword. I have got another cane ready to accompany my collected
works in hand to hand combat, not with ideas, but with those monkeys
who never stop riding them to death from one end of my conscious
self to the other, as well as through my organism they have blighted ... My
cane will be this furious book called forth by ancient peoples now dead,
spotted throughout my nervous fibres like daughters shed." CW 1:21.

sword whose strength of decision is represented by a staff! What does
this mean? It means that I who am speaking have a Sword and a Staff'
(AA, p. 92). To be juxtaposed with this text by Genet: "All burglars will
understand the dignity with which I was arrayed when I held my jimmy, my
'pen.' From its weight, material, and shape, and from its function too,
emanated an authority that made me a man. I had always needed that
steel penis in order to free myself completely from my faggotry, from my
humble attitudes, and to attain the clear simplicity of manliness" (Jean
Genet, Miracle of the Rose, trans. Bernard Frechtman [New York: Grove
Press, 1966], p. 27).
25. Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, p. 6.
26. Let us acknowledge that Artaud is the first to attempt to reassemble, on
a martyrological tree, the vast family of madmen of genius. He does
so in Van Gogh, le suicide de la socittE (1947), one of the rare texts in which
Nietzsche is named, among other "suicides" (Baudelaire, Poe, Nerval,
Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Holderlin, Coleridge). Artaud writes further on:
"No, Socrates did not have this eye; perhaps the only one before Van
Gogh was the unhappy Nietzsche who had the same power to undress
the soul, to pluck the body from the soul, to lay the body of man bare,
beyond the subterfuges of the mind" (AA, p. 16o).

28. "I told you; no works, no language, no words, no mind, nothing. Nothing,
except fine Nerve-Scales. A sort of impenetrable stop in the midst of
everything in our minds" (Nerve-Scales, CW 1:75).
29. "For even the infinite is dead/infinity is the name of a dead man" (84, p.
118). Which means that God did not die at a given moment of
history, but that God is Dead because he is the name of Death itself,
the name of the death within me and the name of that which, having
stolen mefrom my birth, has penetrated my life. As God-Death is difference
within life, he has never ceased to die, that is to say, to live. "For even the
infinite is dead/infinite is the name of a dead man, who is not dead"
(ibid.). Only life without difference, life without death will vanquish
death and God. But it will do so by negating itself as life, within death,
and by becoming God himself. God, thus, is Death: infinite Life,

422 NOTES TO PAGES 232 - 33
Life without difference, as it is attributed to God by the classical
ontotheology or metaphysics (with the ambiguous and remarkable
exception of Hegel) to which Artaud still belongs. But just as death is the
name of difference within life, of finitude as the essence of life, so the
infinity of God, as Life and Presence, is the other name of finitude. But the
other name of the same thing does not mean the same thing as the first
name, is not synonymous with it and this is the entirety of history. [On this
last point, cf. above, note 18.]
30. This is why poetry as such remains an abstract art in Artaud's eyes,
whether poetic speech or writing are in question. Only the theater is
the total art in which is produced, aside from poetry, music and dance, the
"surrection" of the body itself. Also, when we primarily see in Artaud a
poet, the central nerve of his thought escapes us. Unless, of course, we
make poetry into an unlimited genre, that is, the theater with its real
space. To what extent can one follow Maurice Blanchot when he writes,
"Artaud has left us a major document which is nothing other than an Ars
poetica. I acknowledge that he is speaking of the theater in this text, but
what is in question are the demands of poetry such that poetry can be
fulfilled only by rejecting limited genres and by affirming a more original
language .... It is no longer a question of the real space presented by
the stage, but of an other space"? To what extent does one have the right to
add "of poetry" in brackets when one is citing a sentence of Artaud's
defining "the highest idea of theater"? (Cf. La cruelle raison poEtique, p.
69.)
31. Again, the strange resemblance of Artaud to Nietzsche. The praise of the
mysteries of Eleusis (cf. TD, p. 52) and a certain disdain of Latinity (TD,
pp. 40-41) would further confirm this resemblance. However, a difference
is hidden in this resemblance, as we said above rather lapidarily, and this
is the place to specify it. In The Birth of Tragedy, at the moment when (div.
19) Nietzsche designates "Socratic culture" in its "intrinsic substance,"
and with its most "distinct" name, as the "culture of the opera" (p. 142),
Nietzsche wonders about the birth of recitative and the stilo
rappresentativo. This birth can only refer to unnatural instincts foreign to
all aesthetics, be they Appollonian or Dionysian. Recitative, the
subjection of music to libretto, finally corresponds to fear and to the
need for security, to the "yearning for the idyll," to "the belief in the
prehistoric existence of the artistic, good man" (p. 144). "The recitative
was regarded as the rediscovered lan
guage of this primitive man" (p. 144). Opera was "a solace ... found for
the pessimism" inherent in a situation of "frightful uncertainty"

NOTES TO PAGE 233 423

(p.145). And here, as in The Theaterand Its Double, the place of the text is
recognized as that of usurped mastery and as the proper, nonmeta phorical,
practice of slavery. To have the text at one's disposition is to be a master.
"Opera is the birth of the theoretical man, of the critical layman, not of the
artist: one of the most surprising facts in the whole history of art. It was the
demand of thoroughly unmusical hearers that the words must above all
be understood, so that according to them a re-birth of music is only to
be expected when some mode of singing has been discovered in which
the text-word lords over the counterpoint as the master over the servant"
(Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy, trans. William A. Houssman
[New York: Russell and Russell, 19 64] P. 145). And elsewhere, a propos of
the customary tendency to enjoy the text separately by reading it, of the
relations between the scream and the concept, between "gesturesymbolism" and the "tone of the speaker" ("On Music and Words," in
Early Greek Philosophy, trans. Maximilian A. Mugge [New York: Russell and
Russell, 1964], p. 31), and a propos of the "hieroglyphic" relation between
the text ofa poem and music (ibid., p. 37), the musical illustration of the
poem and the project of imparting to music an intelligible language
("What a perverted world! A task that appears to my mind like that of a
son wanting to create his father!" ibid. P. 33)-numerous formulations
announce Artaud. But here it is music, as elsewhere dance, that
Nietzsche wants to liberate from the text and from recitation. Doubtless,
an abstract liberation in Artaud's eyes. Only the theater, the total art
including and utilizing music and dance among other forms of
language, can accomplish this liberation. It must be noted that if
Artaud, like Nietzsche, often supports dance, he never abstracts it from
the theater. If one heedlessly takes dance literally, and not, as we said
above, in an analogical sense, it would not be the entirety of theater.
Artaud, perhaps, would not say, as Nietzsche did, "I can only believe in a
God who would dance." Not only because God could not dance, as
Nietzsche knew, but because dance alone is an impoverished theater.
This specification was even more necessary in that Zarathustra condemns
poets and poetic works as the alienation of the body into metaphor. On
Poets begins thus.: " ' Since I have known the body better,' said
Zarathustra to one of his disciples-'the spirit hath only been to me
symbolically spirit; and all that is 'imperishable'That is also but a
simile.' 'So have I heard thee say once before,' answered the disciple
'and then thou addedst: "But the poets lie too much." Why didst thou say
that the poets lie too much?' . . . 'And fain

would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: but mediaries and
mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, and impure! Ah, I cast

I draw up the head of some ancient God' " (Nietzsche, Thus Spoke
Zarathustra, vol. 2, trans. Thomas Common [New York: Russell and
Russell, 1964], PP. 151, 154). Nietzsche also disdained spectacle
("Spectators, seeketh the spirit of the poet-should they even be buffaloes!" ibid., p. 155), and we know that for Artaud the visibility of the
theater was to cease being an object of spectacle. In this confrontation
we are not concerned with knowing whether it is Nietzsche or Artaud
who went the furthest in destruction. To this question, which is fool
ish, we seem to answer Artaud. In another direction, we could also
legitimately support the opposite.

Twenty years earlier, in Umbilical Limbo: "I suffer because the mind is not

Zarathustra: Reading and Writing: "Of all that is written, I love only what a
person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find
that blood is spirit. / It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood;
I hate the reading idlers. / He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing
more for the reader. Another century of readers-and spirit itself will
stink" (Thus Spoke Zaruthustra, p.43). Why not play the serious game of
juxtaposed citations? It has been written since: "That the dream uses
words (la parole) makes no difference since for the unconscious they are
but one among several elements of the performance (mise en scene)"
(Jacques Lacan, "The Insistence of the Letter in the Unconscious,"
trans. Jan Miel, Yale French Studies, October 1966).

fact. / For thought is a matron who has not always existed. / But let my
life's inflated words inflate themselves through living in the b-a-ba of
composition (de I'ecrit). I am writing for illiterates" (CW 1:19-20).
37. Revolutionary in the full sense, and in particular the political sense. All o f
The Theater and Its Double could be read-this cannot be done here-as
a political manifesto, and moreover a highly ambiguous one.
Renouncing immediate political action, guerilla action, anything that
would have been a waste of forces in the economy of his political

intentions, Artaud intended the preparation of an unrealizable theater,
without the destruction of the political structures of our society. "Dear
friend, I did not say that I wanted to act directly on our times; I said
that the theater I wanted to create assumed, in order to be possible, in
order to be permitted by the times to exist, another form of civilization" (TD, pp. 116-17). Political revolution must first take power from
literality and the world of letters. See, for example, the Post-Script t o the
Manifesto f or an Abortive Theater: in the name of the revolution against
literature, Artaud, aiming at the Surrealists, those "bog-paper
revolutionaries" "with their bowing down to Communism," articulates his
disdain for the "lazy man's revolution," for revolution as simple
"transferring [of] power." "Bombs need to be thrown, but they need to be
thrown at the root of the majority of present-day habits of thought,
whether European or not. I can assure you, those gentlemen, the
Surrealists, are far more affected by such habits than .... the most
urgently needed revolution is a sort of retro-action in time. We ought to
return to the state of mind, or simply even the practices of the Middle
Ages" (CW 2:24-25).
"True culture operates by exaltation and force, while the European
ideal of art attempts to cast the mind into an attitude distinct from
38. force but addicted to exaltation" (TD, p. 1o). A concern for universal
writing appears beneath the surface of the Lettres de Rodez. Artaud
alleged that he had written in "a language which was not French, but
which everyone could read, regardless of his nationality" (to Henri
Parisot).
Artaud did not only reintroduce the written work into his theory of the
theater; he is, in the last analysis, the author ofa body of works. And he
knows it. In a letter from 1946 (cited by Maurice Blanchot in I'Arche
27-28 [1948], p. 133) he speaks of the "two very short books" (The Umbilical
40.
and Nerve-Scales) which "circulate around the profound, inveterate,
endemic absence of any idea." "At the moment, they seemed to me
to be full of cracks, gaps, platitudes and as if stuffed with spontaneous
abortions .... But after twenty years gone by, they appear stupefying, not
as my own triumphs, but in relation to the inexpressible. It is thus that
works are bottled and all lie in relation to the author, constituting a bizarre
truth by themselves .... Something inexpressible expressed by works which
are only part debacles." Thinking then, ofArtaud's convulsed rejection of
the work, can one not say. with the same intonation, the opposite of what
Blanchot says in Le livre a venir? Not "naturally, this is not a work" (p. 49),
but "naturally, this is

426 NOTES TO PAGES 2 4 3 - 5 3
still but a work"? To this extent, the work authorizes the effraction of
commentary and the violence of exemplification, the very violence
which we could not avoid at the moment when we intended to proscribe it. But perhaps we can better comprehend, now, the necessity of this
incoherence.
TN. This is a reaction to Foucault's definition of madness as "the
41 absence of the work." Cf. chap. 2 above, "Cogito and the History of
Madness," note 6.
And today, madness lets itself be "destroyed" by the same destruction as
42. onto-theological metaphysics, the work and the book. We do not say
the same of the text.

7: FREUD AND THE SCENE OF WRITING
1. TN. Phonologism is Derrida's abbreviated fashion of describing one of the

metaphysical gestures inherent in most linguistics: the privilege given
to a model of language based on speech, because speech is the most
present form of language, is presence in language. This is equivalent to the
metaphysical repression of writing, i.e., of difference. Here, too, Derrida
might be challenging Jacques Lacan, whose statement about the
unconscious being structured like a language seems to depend upon
many of the linguistic conceptions which Derrida considers to be
uncritically metaphysical.
2. TN. "Breaching" is the translation we have adopted for the German
word Bahnung. Bahnung is derived from Bohn, road, and literally means
pathbreaking. Derrida's translation of Bahnung is frayage, which has an
idiomatic connection to pathbreaking in the expression, se frayer un
chemin. "Breaching" is clumsy, but it is crucial to maintain the sense of
the force that breaks open a pathway, and the space opened by this
force; thus, "breaching" must be understood here as a shorthand for
these meanings. In the Standard Edition Bahnung has been translated
as "facilitation," and we have, of course, maintained this in all citations
from the Standard Edition. Citations from The Standard Edition of the
Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, London: Hogarth Press
(abbreviated as SE) are by volume and page number.
3. TN. Cf. the end of "Force and Signification," below for a discussion of
differences of force in Nietzsche.
4. Here more than elsewhere, concerning the concepts of difference,
quantity, and quality, a systematic confrontation between Nietzsche

NOTES TO PAGES 253-60 427

and Freud is called for. Cf., for example, among many others, this
fragment from The Will to Power. "Our 'knowing' limits itself to establishing quantities; but we cannot help feeling these differences in
quantity as qualities. Quality is a perspective truth for us; not an 'initself.' ... If we sharpened or blunted our senses tenfold, we should
perish; i.e., with regard to making possible our existence we sense even
relations between magnitudes as qualities" (Nietzsche: The Will to Power,
trans. Walter Kauffmann [New York: Random House, 1967],
p. 304)
5. The concepts of originary diffErance and of delay are unthinkable within the
authority of the logic of identity or even within the concept of time. The very
absurdity betrayed by the terms provides the possibility-if organized in a
certain manner-of thinking beyond that logic and that concept. The word
"delay" must be taken to mean something other than a relation between
two "presents"; and the following model must be avoided: what was to
happen (should have happened) in a (prior) present A, occurs only in a
present B. The concepts of originary diffErance and originary "delay"
were imposed upon us by a reading of Husserl.
6. TN. In "Cogito and the History of Madness" (chap. 2 above), Derrida
begins to elaborate on the metaphysical nature of the concept of decision.
Decision in Greek is krinein, whence comes our "critic." The critic always
decides on a meaning, which can be conceived only in terms of presence.
Since diffErance subverts meaning and presence, it does not
decide.

7. TN. On the relation of force and place (site, topos) see "Force and
Signification" (chap. 2 above).
8. Letter 32 (io Oct. 1895). The machine: "The three systems of neurones, the
'free' and 'bound' states of quantity, the primary and secondary
processes, the main trend and the compromise trend of the nervous
system, the two biological rules of attention and defence, the indications
of quality, reality and thought, the state of the psycho-sexual group,
the sexual determination of repression, and finally the factors
determining consciousness as a perceptual function-the whole thing
held together, and still does. I can hardly contain myself with delight. If I
had only waited a fortnight before setting it all down for you" (Freud: The
Origins of Psychoanalysis: Letters to Wilhelm Fliess, Drafts and Notes, trans. Eric
Mosbacher and James Strachey [New York: Basic Books, 1954], P. 129).

yphes des Egyptiens, ou I'on volt I'origine et le p r o g r e s du langage, Pantiquite
des sciences en Egypte, et I'origine du culte des animaux. This work, which we
shall discuss elsewhere, had considerable influence. All of that era's
reflections on language and signs bore its mark. The editors of the
Encyclopedia, Condillac, and, through him, Rousseau all drew specific
inspiration from it, borrowing in particular the theme of the originally
metaphorical nature of language.

speech as but one element of language and representation among
others in "The Theater of Cruelty and the Closure of Representation"

topographical representation of psychical facts. TN. Derrida's fullest

17. TN. In Being and T i m e , and especially Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics,
Heidegger "deconstructs" Kant's posited timelessness of the cogito, a
position taken over from Descartes, in order to develop an "authentic"
temporality.
18. The metaphor of a photographic negative occurs frequently. Cf. "The
Dynamics of Transference" (SE XI I). The notions of negative and copy are
the principal means of the analogy. In the analysis of Dora, Freud defines
the transference in terms of editions. In "Notes on the Concept of the
Unconscious in Psychoanalysis," 1913 (SE XII, 264). Freud compares the
relations between the conscious and the unconscious to a photographic
process: "The first stage of the photograph is the 'negative'; every
photographic picture has to pass through the 'nega
tive process,' and some of these negatives which have held good in
examination are admitted to the 'positive process' ending in the

picture." Hervey de Saint-Denys devotes an entire chapter of his book to
the same analogy. The intentions are the same. They suggest a
precaution that we will find again in the "Note on the Mystic Writing
Pad": "Memory, compared to a camera, has the marvelous superiority of
natural forces: to be able to renew by itself its means of action."
i9. "Dreams are parsimonious, indigent, laconic." Dreams are "stenographic" (cf. above).
20. TN. Cf. note 12 above.
21. TN. "Invested in all senses of the word" includes the specifically Freudian
sense of Besetzung or libidinal investment, which has been translated into
English as "cathexis." The French investissement is much closer to the
original German.
22. The "Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams," 1916 (SE
XIV) devotes an important development to formal regression, which,
according to the Interpretation of Dreams, entails the substitution of
"primitive methods of expression and representation (which) takes the
place of the usual ones" (V, 548). Freud insists above all on the role of
verbal representations: "It is very noteworthy how little the dream-work
keeps to the word-presentations; it is always ready to exchange one
word for another till it finds the expression most handy for plastic
representation" (XIV, 228). This passage is followed by a comparison,
from the point of view of word-representations and thingrepresentations,
of the dreamer's language and the language of the schizophrenic. It
should be analysed closely. We would perhaps find (against Freud?)
that a rigorous determination of the anomaly is impossible. On the
role of verbal representation in the preconscious and the (consequently)
secondary character of visual elements, cf. The Ego and the Id, chap. 2.
23. "The Claim of Psychoanalysis to Scientific Interest" (SE XIII). The
second part of this text, devoted to "non-psychological sciences," is
concerned first of all with the science of language (p. 176)-before
philosophy, biology, history, sociology, pedagogy.
24. As is known, the note on "The Antithetical Meaning of Primal Words,"
191o (SE XI) tends to demonstrate, after Abel, and with a great
abundance of examples borrowed from hieroglyphic writing, that the
contradictory or undetermined meaning of primal words could be
determined, could receive its difference and its conditions of operation,
only through gesture and writing. On this text and Abel's
hypothesis, cf. Emile Benveniste, Problemes de linguistique generate (Paris:
Gallimard, 1964), chap. 7.

27. Cf. chapter 4 of Beyond the Pleasure Principle.
28. The Standard Edition notes here a slight infidelity in Freud's description.
"The principle is not affected." We are tempted to think that Freud
inflects his description elsewhere as well, in order to suit the
analogy.
29. This is still in chapter 4 of Beyond the Pleasure Principle.
30. TN. In La voix et le phenomene (The Voice and the Phenomenon) trans. David
Allison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), there is a full
"deconstruction" of perception as a past that was
present.
31. TN. "Now what is this wax ...?" The reference is to the Second Meditation,

the timelessness of Descartes's piece of wax is symptomatic of the
metaphysical repression of writing and difference. Cf. note 17 above.
32. We find it again, the same year, in the article on "Negation" (SE XIX).
In a passage which concerns us here for its recognition of the relation
between negation in thought and d fferance, delay, detour (Aufschub,
Denkaufschub) (differance, union of Eros and Thanatos), the sending
out of feelers is attributed not to the unconscious but to the ego. On
Denkaufschub, on thought as retardation, postponement, suspension,
respite, detour, differance as opposed to-or rather d fferante (deferring,
differing) from-the theoretical, fictive, and always already transgressed
pole of the "primary process," cf all of chapter 7 of the Inter
pretation of Dreams. The concept of the "circuitous path" (Umweg) is

central to it. "Thought identity," entirely woven of memory, is an aim
always already substituted for "perceptual identity," the aim of the
"primary process," and d o s gauze Denken ist nur ein Umweg ... ("All
thinking is no more than a circuitous path," SE V, 602). Cf. also the
"Umwege zum Tode" in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. "Compromise," in
Freud's sense, is always differance. But there is nothing before the
compromise.

8: THE THEATER OF CRUELTY AND THE CLOSURE OF
REPRESENTATION
84, p. io9. As in the preceding essay on Artaud, texts referred to by
dates are unpublished. [For the abbreviations used to refer to the
English translations of Artaud, cf. La parole soufflee, chap. 6 above,
note 8.]
2. "The psychology of orgasm conceived as the feeling of a super
abundance of vitality and strength, within the scope of which even pain
acts as a stimulus, gave me the key to the concept of tragic feeling, which
has been misunderstood not only by Aristotle, but also even more by
our pessimists" (Friedrich Nietzsche, The Twilight of the idols, trans.
Anthony Ludovici [New York: Russell and Russell, 1964], p. i1g). Art, as
the imitation of nature, communicates in an essential way with the theme
of catharsis. "Not in order to escape from terror and pity, not to purify
one's self of a dangerous passion by discharging it with vehemencethis is how Aristotle understood it but to be far beyond terror and pity
and to be the eternal lust of becoming itself-that lust which also
involves the lust of destruction. And with this I once more come into
touch with the spot from which I once set out-the 'Birth of Tragedy' was my
first transvaluation of all values: with this again I take my stand upon the
soil from out of which my will and my capacity spring-I, the last
disciple of the philosopher Dionysus-I, the prophet of eternal
recurrence" (ibid., p. 120). TN. That representation is the auto3. presentation of pure visibility and pure sensibility, amounts to
postulating that presence is an effect of repetition.
4. TN. On the question of parricide and the "father of the Logos," cf. "La
pharmacie de Platon," pp. 84ff. in La dissemination.
5. The Theater and its Double would have to be confronted with The Essay
on the Origin of Languages, The Birth of Tragedy, and all the connected
texts of Rousseau and Nietzsche: the System of their analogies and
oppositions would have to be reconstituted.
6. TD, pp. 6o, 110. In this sense the word is a sign, a symptom of living
speech's fatigue, of life's disease. The word, as clear speech subjected
to transmission and to repetition is death in language. "One could say
that the mind, able to go on no longer, resigned itself to the clarities of
speech" (CW 4:289). On why it is necessary to "change the role of
speech in the theater," cf. TD pp. 72-73, 94-95.
7. TN. On these questions, cf. "Freud and the Scene of Writing," chap. 7

9. "Miserable, improbable psyche that the cartel of psychological presuppositions has never ceased pinning into the muscles of humanity"
(letter written from Espalion to Roger Blin, 25 March 1946.) "Only a
very few highly contestable documents on the Mysteries of the Middle
Ages remain. It is certain that they had, from the purely scenic point of
view, resources that the theater has not contained for centuries, but
one could also find on the repressed debates of the soul a science that
modern psychoanalysis has barely rediscovered and in a much less
efficacious and morally less fruitful sense than in the mystical dramas
played on the parvis" (February 1945). This fragment multiplies
aggressions against psychoanalysis.
10. TD, PP. 46 -47. 6o.
11. Against the pact of fear which gives birth to man and to God must be

restored the unity of evil and life, of the Satanic and the divine: "I, M.
Antonin Artaud, born in Marseilles 4 September 1896, I am Satan and I
am god and I do not want anything to do with the Holy Virgin" (written
from Rodez, September 1945).
panied by allusions to participation as an "interested emotion": the
critique of esthetic experience as disinterestedness. It recalls
Nietzsche's critique of Kant's philosophy of art. No more in Nietzsche
than in Artaud must this theme contradict the value of gratuitous play in
artistic creation. Quite to the contrary.

126. [These questions receive an extended treatment in de la
Grammatologie, pp. z35ff]
15. The theater of cruelty is not only a spectacle without spectators, it is
speech without listeners. Nietzsche: "The man in a state of Dionysean
excitement has a listener just as little as the orgiastic crowd, a listener to
whom he might have something to communicate, a listener which the
epic narrator, and generally speaking the Apollonian artist, to be sure,
presupposes. It is rather in the nature of the Dionysean art, that it
has no consideration for the listener: the inspired servant of Dionysus
is, as I said in a former place, understood only by his compeers. But if
we now imagine a listener at those endemic outbursts of Dionysean
excitement then we shall have to prophesy for him a fate similar to that
which Pentheus the discovered eavesdropper suffered,

NOTES TO PAGE 5 310-16

namely, to be torn to pieces by the Maenads .... But now the opera
begins, according to the clearest testimonies, with the demand of the
listener to understand the word. What? The listener demands? The word is to
be understood?" ("On Music and Words," in Early Greek Philosophy,
trans. Maximilian Mugge [New York: Russell and Russell,
1

964], PP. 40-41).

16. TN. Repetition also means "rehearsal" in French.
17. TN. On the economy of dialectics, cf. below "From Restricted to General
Economy." On truth, repetition and the beyond of being, cf. "La
pharmacie de Platon," pp. 192-195 in La dissemination.
18. TN. Derrida seems to be making a point here which is developed much
more fully in "From Restricted to General Economy" (see this volume,
chap. 9). He seems to be referring, if rather elliptically, to the Hegelian
dialectic of the master and the slave, in which the master, who both
risks death and consumes with pleasure, does not maintain the present. The
slave is the truth of the master because he maintains the present through
his relation to work, his deferred consumption of the present. Thus he
is also the embodiment of the dialectical "memory" Erinnerung. Both
master and slave are possibilities of metaphysics, of presence, and to
confirm the one or the other-as happens inevitablyis to repeat a
metaphysical gesture.
19. Letter to Jean Paulhan, 25 January 1936: "I think I have a suitable title for
my book. It will be The Theater and Its Double, for if theater doubles life,
life doubles true theater .... This title corresponds to all the doubles of
the theater that I believe to have found over the course of so many
years: metaphysics, the plague, cruelty ... It is on the stage that the union
of thought, gesture and act is reconstituted" (CW 5272-73)
20. To attempt to reintroduce a purity into the concept of difference, one
returns it to nondifference and full presence. This movement is
fraught with consequences for any attempt opposing itself to an
indicative anti-Hegelianism. One escapes from it, apparently, only by
conceiving difference outside the determination of Being as presence,
outside the alternatives of presence and absence and everything they
govern, and only by conceiving difference as original impurity, that is to
say as differance in the finite economy of the same.
21. Nietzsche again. These texts are well known. Thus, for example, in the
wake of Heraclitus: "And similarly, just as the child and the artist play, the
eternally living fire plays, builds up and destroys, in innocenceand this
game the aeon plays with himself.... The child throws away

433

contemplated by the aesthetic man, who has learned from the artist
and the genesis of the latter's work, how the struggle of plurality can
yet hear within itself law and justice, how the artist stands contemplative
above, and working within the work of art, how necessity and play,
antagonism and harmony must pair themselves for the procreation of
the work of art" ("Philosophy During the Tragic Age of the Greeks," in
Early Greek Philosophy, p. 1o8).

9: FROM RESTRICTED GENERAL ECONOMY
1. "My intention is to minimize Hegel's attitude? But it is the opposite

that is true! I have wanted to demonstrate the incomparable breadth of
his undertaking. To achieve this I could not veil the very slight (and even
inevitable) degree of failure. To my mind, it is rather the exceptional
assuredness of this undertaking that emerges from my juxtapositions.
If he failed, one cannot say that the failure was the result of an error.
The sense of the failure itself differs from the sense of what caused it:
the error alone is fortuitous. Hegel's 'failure' must be spoken of in
general terms, as one would speak of an authentic movement,
pregnant with meaning" (Hegel, la mort et le sacrifice [hereafter Hegel, la
mort], in Deucalion 5 [Neuchatel, 1955], P. 42).
2. Ibid.
3. "De I'existentialisme au primat de I'economie," Critique 19 (Paris,
1947): "It is strange to perceive today what Kierkegaard could not
know: that Hegel, like Kierkegaard, experienced the rejection of all
subjectivity before the absolute idea. In principle, one would
imagine-the rejection being Hegel's-that it was a question of conceptual opposition; on the contrary. The fact is not deduced from a
philosophical text, but from a letter to a friend to whom he confides
that for two years he thought he would go mad .... In a sense, Hegel's
rapid phrase perhaps has a force that Kierkegaard's long cry does not
have. It is any less within existence-which trembles, and exceeds-that
this cry," etc.

6. "Small comic recapitulation. Hegel, I imagine, touched the extreme.
He was still young and thought he would go mad. I even imagine that

NOTES TO PAGES 320-21

he elaborated the system in order to escape (any kind of conquest,
doubtless, is due to a man fleeing a danger). To conclude, Hegel
reaches satisfaction and turns his back on the extreme. Supplication is dead
within him. That one should seek salvation is in itself admissible: one
continues to live, one cannot be sure, one must continue to supplicate.
Hegel gained salvation while still alive and killed supplication, mutilated
himself. Nothing was left of him but a broomhandle, a modern man. But
before mutilating himself, he doubtless touched the extreme and knew
supplication: his memory takes him back to the perceived abyss, in order
to annihilate it! The system is annihilation" (L'experience interieure [hereafter
El; Paris: Gallimard, 1943], p. 6o).
7. On the history of Bataille's reading of Hegel, from the first articles of the
Documents (1929) to L'experience interieure (1943), and on the experience of
the instruction of Koyre, and above all, Kojeve, whose mark dominates
visibly, cf. R. Queneau, "Premieres confrontations avec Hegel," Critique,
195-96. Let us note here and now that at least for Bataille there was no
fundamental rupture between Kojeve's reading of Hegel, to which he
openly subscribed almost totally, and the true instruction of Marxism.
In a bibliography which was to accompany an unpublished Theorie de la
religion, one can read this in particular: "This work (Introduction to the
Reading of Hegel by Kojeve) is an explication o f The Phenomenology of the
Mind. The ideas that I have developed are all here in substance. It
remains to specify the correspondence between Hegelian analysis and
this 'theory of religion': the differences between one representation and
the other seem to me to be easily reducible." "I insist again on
underlining the fact that Alexandre Kojeve's interpretation does not
depart from Marxism in any way: similarly, it is always easy to perceive that
the present 'theory' is always rigorously founded on the analysis of
economy."
8. TN. Baillie, the English translator of Hegel's Phenomenology, translates
Herrschaft as "lordship," while Hyppolite, the French translator,
translates Herr as maitre, making the "master's" operation maitrise.Mattrise also has the sense of mastery, of grasp, and Derrida continually
plays on this double sense, which is lost in English. The difference between
sovereignty and lordship (maitriser) is that sovereignty does not seek to
grasp (maitriser) concepts but rigorously to explode them. All citations
from Hegel are indicated in the text; and are from The Phenomenology
of the Mind, trans. J. B. Baillie (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1967).
9. "A passage from the preface to the Phenomenology of the Mind

forcefully expresses the necessity of such an attitude. No doubt that this
admirable text, from the initial contact, is of capital importance,' not
only for understanding Hegel, but in every sense: 'Death, as we may
call that unreality, is the most terrible thing, and to keep and hold fast
what is dead demands the greatest force of all. Beauty, powerless and
helpless, hates understanding, because the latter exacts from it what
it cannot perform. But the life of mind is not one that shuns death,
and keeps clear of destruction; it endures death and in death maintains
its being. It only wins to its truth when it finds itself utterly torn
asunder. It is this mighty power, not by being a positive which turns
away from the negative, as when we

say

of anything it is nothing or it is

false, and being then done with it, pass off to something else: on the
contrary, mind is this power only by looking the negative in the face,
and dwelling with it. This dwelling beside it is the magic power that
converts the negative into being.' " (Hegel, p. 93). Bataille, whom we are
quoting here, while referring to the translation [of the Phenomenology into
French] by Jean Hyppolite, says that he is reproducing a translation by
Alexandre Kojeve, which he is not doing exactly. If one takes into
account that Hyppolite and Kojeve had since modified their
translations, one has at one's disposal at least five forms of the text,
to which could be added the "original," that other lesson.

13. TN. Derrida is playing on the idea that Aufhebung means to negate and

to conserve at the same time. In the Phenomenology each step along the
way is "lifted up and interiorized," negated and conserved, in the next
step. Thus the Aufhebung leaves nothing behind, and is the best of
speculators because it wastes nothing and profits from everything.
Bataille, Derrida is demonstrating, is not a "speculator" because he is
concerned precisely with what is left behind, with the excess which the
Aufhebung excludes because it cannot profit (i.e., make sense) from it.

Seriousness, death and pain are the basis of its obtuse truth. But the
seriousness of death and pain is the servility of thought." ("Postscriptum," in El, p. 253) The unity of seriousness, meaning, work,
servility, discourse, etc., the unity of man, slave and God-such, in
Bataille's eyes, is the profound content of (Hegelian) philosophy. Here, we
can only refer to the most explicit texts. (A.) El, p. 105: "In this my efforts

a philosophy of work, of the 'project.' Hegelian manBeing and God-is
fulfilled in the adequation of the project .... The slave .... after many
meanders, acceeds to the summit of the universal. The only obstacle to
this way of thinking (which is, moreover, of an unequaled, and in some way
inaccessible, profundity) is that man is irreducible to the project:
nondiscursive existence, laughter, ecstasy," etc. (B.) Le coupable, p. 133:
"In elaborating the philosophy of work (this is the knecht, the
emancipated slave, the worker, who in the Phenomenology becomes
God), Hegel has suppressed chance-and laughter," etc. (C.) In Hegel, la

could," and that he misses "for the benefit of servitude." "The
sovereignty of Hegel's attitude springs from a movement revealed by
discourse and which, in the Sage's mind, is never separated from its
revelation. It cannot, therefore, be fully sovereign: the Sage, in effect,
cannot fail to subordinate it for the ends of a Wisdom which assumes the
completion of discourse ... He gathered up sovereignty like a weight,
which he dropped" (pp. 41-42).

read Bataille's text if one did not weave these propositions into the
them within, themselves. Thus, a page further on: "And it does not
even suffice to say: one cannot speak of the sovereign moment without
altering it, without altering it insofar as it is truly sovereign. To the same
extent as to speak of it, to s e e k these movements is contradictory. At

a "reactionary" sense. The consumption of the excess of energy by a
determined class is not the destructive consuming of meaning, but the
significative reappropriation of a surplus value within the space of
restricted economy. From this point of view, sovereignty is absolutely
revolutionary. But it is also revolutionary as concerns a revolution
which would only reorganize the world of work and would redistribute
values within the space of meaning, that is to say, still within restricted
economy. This last movement-only slightly perceived, here and
there, by Bataille (for example, in La part maudite. when he evokes the
"radicalism of Marx" and the "revolutionary sense that Marx formulated

insincere. It is purely fictive in a sense of this word that the classical
oppositions of true and false, essence and appearance, lack. It

withdraws itself from every theoretical or ethical question. Simultaneously, it offers itself to these questions on its minor side, to which it
is united, as Bataille says, in work, discourse and meaning. ("What
obliges me to write, I imagine, is the fear of going mad," Sur

Nietzsche.) On this side one can wonder, as easily and legitimately as
possible, if Bataille is "sincere." Which Sartre does: "Here then is an
invitation to lose ourselves without forethought, without counterpart,
without salvation. Is it sincere?" (p. 162). Further on: "For, after all, M.
Bataille writes, occupies a position at the Bibliotheque Nationale,
reads, makes love, eats" (p. 163).
Conferences sur le non-savoir. The Objects of science are, then, "effects" of
knowledge. Effects of nonmeaning. This is, for example, God, insofar as
an object of theology. "God is also an effect of un-knowledge" (ibid.).
36. TN. L'experience interieure was to be part of a projected series to be
called Somme atheologique.
37. Cf. Meister Eckhart, for example. The negative movement of the discourse on God is only a phase of positive ontotheology. "God is nameless
.... If I say God is a being, it is not true: he is a transcendental essence,
a superessential nothing" (Be ye renewed in the spirit). This was only a turn
or detour of language for ontotheology: "But when I say God is not
being, is superior to being, I do not with that deny him being: I dignify
and exalt it in him" (Like the morning star) (Franz Pfeiffer, Meister Eckhart
[London: John M. Watkins, 1956], pp. 246 and 211).
38. In order to define the point at which he departs from Hegel and
Kojeve, Bataille specifies what he means by "conscious mysticism,"
"beyond classical mysticism": "The atheistic mystic, conscious of himself
conscious of having to die and to disappear, would live, as Hegel says,
evidently about himself, 'in absolute rending'; but for Hegel, it was only a
question of a phase: as opposed to Hegel, the atheist mystic would
never emerge from it, 'contemplating the Negative quite directly,' but
never able to transpose it into Being, refusing to do so and maintaining
himself in ambiguity" (Hegel).
39. Here, again, the difference counts more than the content of the terms.
And these two series of oppositions (major/minor, archaic/classic) should
be combined with the series we elaborated above as concerns the poetic
(sovereign
nonsubordination/insertion/subordination).
To
archaic
sovereignty, "which indeed seems to have implied a kind of impotency,"
and which, insofar as it is "authentic" sovereignty, refuses

"the exercise of power" (subjugating lordship), Bataille opposes "the
classic idea of sovereignty," which "is linked to the idea of command" and
consequently wields all the attributes which are refused, under the same
word, to the sovereign operation (free, victorious, self-conscious,
acknowledged, etc., subjectivity, which is therefore mediated and
turned a w a y from itself, returning to itself for having been turned away
from itself by the work of the slave). Now, Bataille demonstrates that the
"major positions" of sovereignty, as much as the minor ones, can be
inserted into the sphere of activity" (Methode).
The difference between the major and the minor is therefore only
analogous to the difference between the archaic and the classic. And
neither the one nor the other must be understood in a classic or minor
fashion. The archaic is not the originary or the authentic, as they are
determined by philosophical discourse. The major is not opposed to the
minor like big to little, high to low. In "Vieille taupe" (Old Mole), (an
unpublished article, rejected b y Bifurs), the oppositions of high to low,
and of all the significations in sur-, super- (surreal, superman) and in sub(subterranean, etc.), of the imperialist eagle and the proletarian mole, are
examined in all the possibilities of their reversals.
40. "Play is nothing if not an open and unreserved challenge to everything
opposed to play" (marginal note in the unpublished "Theorie de la
religion," which Bataille also planned to entitle "To die laughing and to
laugh at dying").
41. "A gesture ... irreducible to classical logic and for which no logic seems to
be constituted" says Sollers in Le toit, which begins by unmasking, in
their systematicity, all the forms of pseudotransgression, the social and
historical figurations in which can be read the complicity between "the man
who lives without protest under the yoke of the law, and the man for whom
the law is nothing." In this last case, repression is only "redoubled" (Le
toit: Essai de lecture systematique, in Logiques [Paris: Seuil, 1968], p. 168).
42. Like every discourse, like Hegel's, Bataille's discourse has the form of a
structure of interpretations. Each proposition, which is already
interpretive in nature, can be interpreted by another proposition.
Therefore, if we proceed prudently and all the while remain in Bataille's text,
we can detach an interpretation from its reinterpretation and submit it
to another interpretation bound to other propositions of the system.
Which, without interrupting general systematicity, amounts to recognizing
the strong and weak moments in the interpretation of a body of thought
by itself, these differences of force keeping to the

strategic necessity of finite discourse. Naturally our own interpretive
reading has attempted to pass through what we have interpreted as the
major moments, and has done so in order to bind them together. This
"method"-which we name thus within the closure of knowledge-is
justified by what we are writing here, in Bataille's wake, about the
suspension of the epoch of meaning and truth. Which neither frees nor
prohibits us from determining the rules of force and of weakness: which
are always a function of: (1) the distance from the moment of sovereignty;
(2) the misconstruing of the rigorous norms of knowledge.
The greatest force is the force of a writing which, in the most
audacious transgression, continues to maintain and to acknowledge the
necessity of the system of prohibitions (knowledge, science, philosophy,
work, history, etc.). Writing is always traced between these two sides of the
limit.
Among the weak moments of Bataille's discourse, certain ones are
signaled by the determined unknowledge which

is a certain philo-

sophical ignorance. And Sartre justly notes that "he has visibly not
understood Heidegger, of whom he often and clumsily speaks" and
that then "philosophy avenges itself" (Situations I, p. 145). Here, there
would be much to say about the reference to Heidegger. We will
attempt to do so elsewhere. Let us only note that on this point and
several others, Bataille's "faults" reflected the faults which, at that
time, marked the reading of Heidegger by "specialized philosophers." To
adopt Corbin's translation of Dasein as human-reality (a monstrosity of
unlimited consequences that the first four paragraphs of Sein and Zeit had
warned against), to use this translation as an element of a discourse,
to speak insistently about

a "humanism common to Nietzsche and

our author [Bataille]," (p. 165) etc.-this, too, was philosophically very
risky on Sartre's part. Drawing attention to this point in order to
illuminate Bataille's text and context, we doubt neither the historic
necessity of this risk, nor the function of awakening whose price it was,
within a conjuncture that is no longer ours. All this merits recognition.
Awakening and time have been necessary.

1 TN. The reference, in a restricted sense, is to the Freudian theory of

neurotic symptoms and of dream interpretation in which a given symbol
is understood contradictorily as both the desire to fulfill an impulse
and the desire to suppress the impulse. In a general sense the reference is
to Derrida's thesis that logic and coherence themselves can only be
understood contradictorily, since they presuppose the suppression o f d
ferance, "writing" in the sense of the general economy. Cf. "La
pharmacie de Platen," in La dissemination, pp. 125-26, where Derrida
uses the Freudian model of dream interpretation in order to clarify the
contractions embedded in philosophical coherence.

chapter entitled "The Violence of the Letter: From Levi-Strauss to
Rousseau" (pp. 149ff), Derrida expands the analysis of Levi-Strauss
begun in this essay in order further to clarify the ways in which the
contradictions of traditional logic "program" the most modern conceptual apparatuses of linguistics and the social sciences.

The Gift
with a foreword by Mary Douglas
M ar c e l Ma u s s
'The teaching of Marcel Mauss was one to which few can be compared. No
acknowledgement of him can be proportionate to our debt.' Claude Levi-Strauss
In this seminal work, Michael Mauss utterly revolutionized our
understanding of the process of exchange thereby calling into question the
rationale behind society's most cherished assumptions. In a world
increasingly obsessed by runaway consumption The Gift has never been of
greater relevance and, as Lcvi-Strauss remarked, few can read this book
without feeling that they are somehow 'present at a decisive event in the
evolution of science.'

A General Theory of Magic
M ar c e l Ma u s s
'It is enough to recall that Mauss' influence is not limited to ethnographers, none
of whom could claim to have escaped it, but extends also to linguists,
psychologists, historians of religion and or religion and orientalists.' Claude LeviStrauss
As a study of magic in 'primitive' societies and its survival today in our thoughts
and social actions, A General Theory of Magic represents what Claude Lâ¬viStrauss called the astonishing modernity of the mind of one of the century's
greatest thinkers. At a period when art, magic and science appear to be
crossing paths once again, A General Theory of Magic presents itself as a classic
for our times.
