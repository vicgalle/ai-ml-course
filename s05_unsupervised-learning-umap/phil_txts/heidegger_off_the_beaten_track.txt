Track

This collection of text'i (originally published in German under the title

Holzwege) is Heideggers first post-war book and contains some of the major
expositions of his later philosophy. Of particular note are "The Origin of the
Work of Art," perhaps the most discussed of
"Nietzsche's Word: 'God Is Dead,"' which

aJI of Heidegger's essays, and

research. Although translations of the essays have appeared individually in
a variety of places, this is the first English translation to bring them all
together as I leidegger intended. The text is taken from the last edition
of the work, which contains the author's final corrections together with
important marginal annotations that provide considerable insight into the
development of his thought. This fresh and accurate new translation will
be an invaluable resource for all students of Heidegger, whether they work
in philosophy, literary theory, religious studies, or intellectual history.

Translators' preface

here translated as Off the Beaten Track is the tide Heidegger
gave to this collection of six essays and lectures which was first published in
1950. The essays and lectures themselves span a little more than a decade,
from 1935 to 1946. The text used for this translation is taken from the sev­
enth edition of Holzwege, which is itself based on volume V of the Gesamt­
ausgabe. The notes at the foot of the page are Heidegger's own, generally
marginalia or other notes in his working copies of the texts (see the "Editor's
epilogue," translated below, for further bibliographical information).
W here these notes refer to works that have been translated into English, ref­
erences to the original texts have been replaced by references to these trans­
lations. Where no such translations exist, references to the German texts re­
main. The notes at the end of the volume are the translators' and are limited
to identifying the sources of quotations and otherwise providing a minimwn
of information that seems helpful to readers of Heidegger in English.
In entiding his work Holzwege, literally, "'limber lracks," or "Forest
Paths," Heidegger chose a term that carefully balances positive and negative
implications. On the one hand, a Holz11'eg is a timber track that leads to a
clearing in the forest where timber is cut. On the other, it is a track that used
to lead to such a place but is now overgrown and leads nowhere. Hence, in
a popular German idiom, to be "on a Holzwelf' is to be on the wrong track
or in a cul-de-sac. A translation ofHeidegger's note on the tide appears at
the beginning of the book, where it is found in most German editions. It
is in order to capture something of lleidegger's dual meaning that we have
adopted the tide "Off the Beaten Track."
Each translator bears primary responsibility for three of the six essays:
Julian Young translated "The Origin of the Work of Art," "The Age of the
World Picture," and "Anaximander's Saying"; Kenneth Haynes translated
the others. Each read the other's work closely; and translated in awareness
of the other; nonetheless, in our collaboration we did not aim to eliminate
all differences in style.

TRA:-.ISLATORS' PREFACE

We have translated "Sein" as "being," preferring a lower-case "b" to
capital.
This choice has not been made in order to take a stand in the
a
controversy over the possible religious or quasi-religious implications of
Heidegger's vocabulary. In fact, both translators agree with Julian Young's
description of a fundamental ambiguity in Heidegger's use of the word Sein,
which refers sometimes to presence, the ground of beings, the fundamental
horizon of disclosure; and sometimes to this disclosure along with what is
not disclosed or made intelligible (Heidegger's Later Philosophy, Cambridge
University Press, 2002, chapter 1). That is, like the word "day," which may
refer either to the period of daylight or to the period of both daylight and
night, Heidegger's use of Sein must be read in context. However, it would
have been unduly intrusive to translate sometimes with a capital "B" and
sometimes without. Since some passages require the lower-case "b," we
have translated Sein in this way throughout.
We have not generally attempted to reproduce Heidegger's word-play,
since such attempts usually require very unidiomatic writing, which would
give a false impression ofthe way Heidegger writes, in addition to obscuring
his sense. However, rather than lose the word-phiy, we have often included
the key German words in square brackets. The German has been included
at other instances, when it seemed important to alert the reader to recur­
rences of crucial German words, when the German was particularly rich in
meaning, or on the few occasions when we required some latitude in the
English translation. The glossary has been kept short since the German
has often been included in the main body of the translation; it is mainly
concerned with words translated in several ways.

The Origin ofthe Work ofArta

Originb means here that from where and through which a thing is what it
is and how it is. That which something is, as it is, we call its nature [ Wesen].
The origin of something is the source of its nature. The question of the
origin of the artwork asks about the source of its nature. According to the
usual view, the work arises out of and through the activity of the artist. But
through and from what is the artist that' which he is? Through the work;
for the Gennan proverb "the work praises the master" means that the work
first lets the artist emerge as a master of art. The artist is the origin of the
work. The work is the origin of the artist. Neither is without the other.
Nonetheless neither is the sole support of the other. Artist and work are
each, in themselves and in their reciprocal relation, on account of a third
thing, which is prior to both; on account, that is, of that from which both
artist and artwork take their names, on account of art.
As the artist is the origin of the work in a necessarily different way from
the way the work is the origin of the artist, so it is in yet another way, quite
certainly, that art is the origin of both artist and work. But can, then, art
really be an origin? Where and how does art exist? Art- that is just a word

to which nothing real any longer corresponds. It may serve as a collective
notion under which we bring what alone of art is real: works and artists.
Even if the word art is to signify more than a collective notion, what is
meant by the word could only be based on the reality of works and artists.
Or are matters the other way round? Do work and artist exist only insofar
as

art

exists, exists, indeed, as their origin?

Whatever we decide, the question of the origin of the artwork turns into
the <]Uestion of the nature of art. But since it must remain open whether and
how there is art at all, we will attempt to discover the nature of art where
there is no doubt that art genuinely prevails. Art presences in the art-work

[Kunst-werk]. But what and how is a work of art?
What art is we should be able to gather from the work. What the work
is we can only find out from the nature of art. It is easy to see that we
are moving in a circle. The usual understanding demands that this cir­
cle be avoided as an offense against logic. It is said that what art is may
be gathered from a comparative study of available artworks. But how can
we be certain that such a study is really based on artworks unless we know
beforehand what

art

is? Yet the nature of art can as little be derived from

higher concepts as from a collection of characteristics of existing artworks.
For such a derivation, too, already has in view just those detem1inations
which are sufficient to ensure that what we are offering as works of art
are what we already take to be such. The collecting of characteristics from
what exists, however, and the derivation from fundamental principles are
impossible in exactly the same way and, where practiced, are a self-delusion.
So we must move in a circle. This is neither ad hoc nor deficient. 'Jo enter
upon this path is the strength, and to remain on it the feast of thought assuming that thinking is a craft. Not only is the main step from work to
art, like the step from art to work, a circle, but every individual step that we
attempt circles within this circle.
In order to discover the nature of art that really holds sway in the work
let us approach the actual work and ask it what and how it is.
Everyone is familiar with artworks. One finds works of architecture and
sculpture erected in public places, in churches, and in private homes. Art­
works from the most diverse ages and peoples are housed in collections
and exhibitions. If we regard works in their pristine reality and do not
deceive ourselves, the following becomes evident: works are as naturally
present as things. The picture hangs on the wall like a hunting weapon or

a hat. A painting- for example van Gogh's portrayal of a pair of peasant
shoes - travels from one exhibition to another. Works are shipped like coal
from the Ruhr or logs from the Black Forest. During the war Holderlin's
hymns were packed in the soldier's knapsack along with cleaning equip­
ment. Beethoven's quartets lie in the publisher's storeroom like potatoes in
a cellar.
Every work has this thingly character. What would they be without it?
But perhaps we find this very crude and external approach to the work
offensive. It may be the conception of the artwork with which the freight­
handler or the museum charlady operates, but we are required to take the
works as they are encountered by those who experience and enjoy them.
Yet even this much-vaunted "aesthetic experience" cannot evade the thing­
liness of the artwork. The stony is in the work of architecture, the wooden
in the woodcarving, the colored in the painting, the vocal in the linguis­
tic work. the sounding in the work of music. The thingly is so salient in
the artwork that we ought rather to say the opposite: the architectural
work is in the stone, the woodcarving in the wood, the painting in the
color, the linguistic work in the sound, the work of music in the note.
"Obviously," it will be replied. What, however, is this obvious thingliness
in the artwork?
Given that the artwork is something over and above its thingliness, this
inquiry will probably be found unnecessary and disconcerting. This some­
thing else in the work constitutes its artistic nature. The artwork is indeed
a thing that is made, but it says something other than the mere thing itself
is,

a"A"Ao ayoprue1. The work makes publicly known something other than

itself, it manifests something other: it is an allegory.

In the artwork some­

thing other is brought into conjunction with the thing that is made. The
Greek for "to bring into conjunction with" is

av1,1j3a"A"Aelv. The work is a

symbol.
Allegory and symbol provide the conceptual framework from within
whose perspective the artwork has long been characterized. Yet this one
element that makes another manifest is the thingly element in the artwork.
It seems almost as though the thingliness in the artwork is the substructure
into and upon which the other, authentic, element is built. And is it not this
thingly element which is actually produced by the artist's craft?
We wish to hit upon the immediate and complete reality of the artwork,
for only then wilJ we discover the real art within it. So what we must do,
first of all, is to bring the thingliness of the work into view. For this we
need to know, with sufficient clarity, what a thing is. Only then will we be

3

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

able to say whether or not an artwork is a thing - albeit a thing to which
something else adheres. Only then will we be able to decide whether the
work is something fundamentally different and not a thing at all.

THE TiliNG AND THE WORK
What, in truth, is a thing insofar as it is a thing? When we ask this question
we wish to know the thing-being (the thingliness) of the thing. The point is
to learn the thingliness of the thing. To this end we must become acquainted
with the sphere within which are to be found all those beings which we have
long called things.
The stone on the path is a thing, as is the clod of earth in the field. The
jug is a thing, and the well beside the path. But what should we say about
the milk in the jug and the water in the well? These, too, are things, if
the cloud in the sky and the thistle in the field, if the leaf on the autumn
wind and the hawk over the wood are properly called things. All these must
indeed be called things, even though we also apply the term to that which,
unlike the above, fails to show itself, fails to appear. One such thing which
does not, itc;elf, appear- a "thing in itself" in other words- is, according to
Kant, the world as a totality. Another such example is God himself. Things
in themselves and things that appear, every being that in any way exists,
count, in the language of philosophy, as "things."
These days, airplanes and radios belong among the things that are closest
to us. W hen, however, we refer to "last things," we think of something quite
different. Death and judgment, these are the last things. In general, "thing"
applies to anything that is not simply nothing.
artwork counts

as

In

this signification, the

a thing, assuming it to be some kind of a being. Yet this

conception of the thing, in the first instance at least, docs not help us in our
project of distinguishing between beings which have the being of things and
beings which have the being of works. And besides, we hesitate to repeat
the designation of God as a "thing." We are similarly reluctant to take the
farmer in the field, the stoker before the boiler, the teacher in the school to
be a "thing." A human being is not a thing. True, we say of a young girl who
has a task to perform that is beyond her that she is "too young a thing." But
this is only because, in a certain sense, we find human being to be missing
here and think we have to do, rather, with what constitutes the thingliness
of the thing. We are reluctant to call even the deer in the forest clearing,
the beetle in the grass, or the blade of grass "things." Rather, the hammer,
the shoe, the ax, and the clock are things. Even they, however, are not mere

4

THE O RIGIN OF THF. WORK OF ART

things. Only the stone, the clod of earth, or a piece of wood count as that:
what is lifeless in nature and in human usage. It is the things of nature and
usage that are normally called things.
We thus see ourselves returned from the broadest domain in which ev­
erything is a thing (thing= m =ens= a being) - including even the "first
and last things"- to the narrow region of the mere thing. "Mere," here,
means, first of all, the pure thing which is simply a thing and nothing more.
But then it also means "nothing but a thing," in an almost disparaging sense.
It is the mere thing- a category which excludes even the things that we use­
which counts as the actual thing.

In what, now, does the thingliness of things

such as this consist? It is in reference to these that it must be pos.'iible to
determine the thingliness of the thing. Such a determination puts us in a
position to characterize thingliness as such. Thus equipped, we will be able
to indicate that almost tangible reality of the work in which something other
inheres.
Now it is a well-known fact that, since antiquity, as soon as the question
was raised as to what beings as such arc, it was the thing in its thingness
which thrust itself forward as the paradigmatic being. It follows that we arc
bound to encounter the delineation of the thingness of the thing already
present in the traditional interpretation of the being. Thus all we need to do,
in order to be relieved of the tedious effort of making our own inquiry into
the thingliness of the thing, is to grasp explicitly this traditional knowledge
of the thing. So commonplace, in a way, are the answers to the question of
what a thing is that one can no longer sense anything worthy of questioning
lying behind them.
The interpretations of the thingness of the thing which predominate in
the history of Western thought have long been self-evident and are now in
everyday use. They may be reduced to three.
A mere thing is, to take an example, this block of granite. It is hard, heavy,
extended, massive, unformed, rough, colored, partly dull, partly shiny. We
can notice all these features in the stone. We take note of its characteristics.
Yet such characteristics represent something proper to the stone. They arc
its properties. The thing has them. The thing? What are we thinking of if we
now call the thing to mind? Obviously the thing is not merely a collection
of characteristics, and neither is it the aggregate of those properties through
which the collection arises. The thing, as everyone thinks he knows, is that
around which the properties have gathered .. One speaks, then, of the core
of the thing. The Greeks, we are told, called it

TO li'ITOKEIIJEVOV. This core of

the thing was its ground and was always there. But the characteristics are

5

OFF Ti l E BEATEN TRACK

called

Ta av1Jj3Ej31lK6Ta: that which always appears and comes forth along

with the core.
These designations are by no means arbitrary. Within them speaks some­
thing which lies beyond the scope of this essay: the Greeks' fundamental
experience of the being of beings in the sense of presence. It is through
these determinations, however, that the interpretation of the thingness
of the thing is grounded that will henceforth become standard and the
Western interpretation of the being of beings established. The process be­
gins with the appropriation of the Greek words by Roman-Latin thought;

&rroKEiiJEVov becomes subiectum, &rr6o-Taa1s S71bsta1ltia, and O"VIJj3EJ31lKOs acci­

dens.

This translation of Greek names into Latin is by no means without

consequences - as, even now, it is still held to be. Rather, what is concealed
within the apparently literal, and hence faithful, translation is a mmslation

[ Ubersetzm] of Greek experience into a different mode of thinking. Roman
thinking takes over the Gt·eek words without the con·esponding and equiprimo1"­
dial experience ofwhat they say, without the Greek word. The rootlessness of
Western thinking begins with this translation.
It is generally held that the definition of the thingness of the thing in
tem1s of substance and accidents appears to capture our natural view of
things. No wonder, then, that the way we comport ourselves to things- the
way we address ourselves to, and talk about, them- has accommodated it'>elf
to this commonplace outlook on things. The simple declarative sentence
consists of a subject- the Latin translation, and that means transformation,
of

\moKEi!Jevov

-

and predicate, which expresses the thing's characteristics.

W ho would dare to threaten this simple and fundamental relationship be­
tween thing and sentence, between the structure of the sentence and the
structure of the thing? �onetheless, we must ask: is the structure of the
simple declarative sentence (the nexus of subject and predicate) the mirror
image of the structure of the thing (the union of substance and accidents)?
Or is it merely that, so represented, the structure of the thing is a projection
of the structure of the sentence?
What could be more obvious than that man transposes the way he com­
prehends things in statements into the structure of the thing it'>elf? Yet this
view, apparently critical but in reality overly hasty, has first to explain how
the transposition of the sentence structure into the thing could he possible
without the thing first becoming visible. The issue as to what comes first
and provides the standard, the structure of the sentence or that of the thing,
remains, to this day, undecided. It may even be doubted whether, in this
fonn, it is capable of a decision.

6

THE ORIGIN OF THE WORK O F ART

In fact, it is the case neither that sentential structure provides the standard
for projecting the structure of the thing nor that the latter is simply mirrored
in the former. The structure of both sentence and thing derive, in their
natures and the possibility of their mutual relatedness, from a common and
more primordial source. In any case, this first of our interpretations of the
thingness of the thing- thing as bearer of characteristics - is, in spite of its
currency, not as natural as it seems. \Vhat presents itself to us as natural,
one may suspect, is merely the familiarity of a long-established habit which
has forgotten the unfamiliarity from which it arose. And yet this unfamiliar
source once struck man as strange and caused him to think and wonder.
The reliance on the customary interpretation of the thing is only ap­
parently well founded. Moreover, this conception of the thing (the bearer
of characteristics) is applied not only to the mere, the actual, thing but to
any being whatever. It can never help us, therefore, to distinguish beings
which are things from those which are not. But prior to all reflection, to be
attentively present in the domain of things tells us that this concept of the
thing is inadequate to its thingliness, its self-sustaining and self-containing
nature. From time to time one has the feeling that violence has long been
done to the thingliness of the thing and that thinking has had something to
do with it. Instead of taking the trouble to make thinking more thoughtful,
this has led to the rejection of thinking. But when it comes to a definition
of the thing, what is the use of a feeling, no matter how cenain, if the word
belongs to thought alone? Yet perhaps what, here and in sirnilar cases, we
call feeling or mood is more rational - more perceptive, that is - than we
think; more rational, because more open to being than that "reason" which,
having meanwhile become

ratio,

is misdescribed as rational. The furtive

craving for the ir-rational - that abortive offspring of a rationality that has
not been thought through - renders a strange service. 'Jo be sure, the fa­
miliar concept of the thing fits every thing. But it does not comprehend the
essence of the thing; rather, it attacks it.
Can such an assault be avoided? How? Only if we grant to the thing, so to
speak, a free field in which to display its thingness quite directly. Everything
that, by way of conception and statement, might interpose itself between
us and the thing must, first of all, be set aside. Only then do we allow
ourselves the undistoned presence of the thing. But this allowing ourselves
an immediate encounter with the thing is something we do not need either
to demand or to arrange. It happens slowly.. In what the senses of sight,
hearing, and touch bring to us, in the sensations of color, sound, roughness,
and hardness, things move us bodily, in a quite literal sense. The thing is the

7

OFF THE B EATE:'I.: TRACK

alafu]T6v, that which, in the senses belonging to sensibility, is perceptible
by means of sensations. I lcnce, the concept later became commonplace
according to which the thing is nothing but the unity of a sensory manifold.
\Vhether this unity is conceived as sum, totality, or as form changes nothing
with respect to the standard-setting character of this concept of the thing.
Now this interpretation of the thingness of the thing is every bit as correct
and verifiable as its predecessor. This is already sufficient to cast doubt on
its truth. If we think through that for which we are searching, the thingness
of the thing, then this concept of the thing again leaves us at a loss. In
immediate perception, we never really perceive a throng of sensations, e.g.
tones and noises. Rather, we hear the storm whistling in the chimney, the
three-motored plane, the Mercedes which is immediately different from the
Adler. • Much closer to us than any sensation arc the things themselves. In
the house we hear the door slam-never acoustic sensations or mere noises.
'Io hear a bare sound we must listen away from the things, direct our cars

from them, listen abstractly.
The concept of the thing under consideration repre.o;ents, not so much
an assault on the thing as an extravagant attempt to bring the thing to us in
the greatest possible immediacy. But this can never be achieved as long as
we take what is received by the senses to constitute its thingness. \Vhereas
the first interpretation of the thing holds it, as it were, too far away from
the body, the second brings it too close.

In both interpretations the thing

disappears. We must, therefore, avoid the exaggerations of both. The thing
must be allowed to remain unmolested in its resting-within-itself itself. It
must be accepted in its own stcadfasmess. This seems to be what the third
interpretation does, an interpretation which is just as old as the first two.
That which gives to things their constancy and pith but is also, at the
same time, the source of their mode of sensory pressure - color, sound,
hardness, massiveness -is the materiality of the thing. In this definition of
the thing as matter

(vhf)), form (llOP«!>il) is posited at the same time. The

permanence of a thing, its constancy, consists in matter remaining together
with form. The thing is formed matter. This interpretation of the thing
invokes the immediate sight with which the thing concerns us through its
appearance

(eiSos). With this synthesis of matter and form we have finally

found the concept of the thing which equally well fits the things of nature
and the things of use.
This concept of the thing puts us in a position to answer the question
of the thingly in the artwork. \Vhat is thingly in the work is obviously the
matter of which it consists. The matter is the substructure and the field
8

THE ORIGI!'\ OF T i l E WORK OF ART

for artistic fonnation. But we could have proposed this plausible and well­
known conclusion at the very beginning. Why did we make the detour
through the other concepts of the thing? Because we also mistrust this
concept of the thing, the representation of the thing as formed matter.
But is it not precisely this pair of concepts, matter and form, that are
generally employed in the domain in which we are supposed to be moving?
Of course. The distinction between matter and form is the conceptual scheme

deployed in the greatest variety of ways by all a1t theory and aesthetics. This in­
disputable fact, however, proves neither that the matter-form distinction
is adequately grounded, nor that it belongs, originally, to the sphere of

art

and the artwork. Moreover, the range of application of this conceptual pair­
ing has long extended far beyond the field of aesthetics. .Form and content
are the commonplace concepts w1der which anything and everything can
be subswned. If one correlates form with the rational and matter with the
ir-rational, if, moreover, one takes the rational to be the logical and the
irrational the illogical, and if, finally, one couples the conceptual duality
between fonn and matter into the subject-object relation, then one has at
one's disposal a conceptual mechanism that nothing can resist.
If this is how it is, however, with the matter-form distinction, how can
it help

us

comprehend the special region of the mere thing as distinct from

other beings? But perhaps this characterization in terms of matter and form
can regain its power of definition if we just reverse the process of the broad­
ening and emptying of these concepts. Yet this, of course, presupposes that
we know in which region of beings they exercise their real power of def­
inition. That this might be the region of mere things is, so far, merely
an assumption. Taking into account the extensive usc of this conceptual
framework in aesthetics might rather suggest that matter and form are de­
terminations which have their origin in the nature of the artwork and have
been transported from there back to the thing. Where does the origin of
the matter-form schema have its origin; in the thingness of the thing or in
the work-character of the artwork?
The granite block, resting in itself, is something material possessing a
definite, if unstructured, form. "Fonn," here, means the distribution and
arrangement of material parts in a spatial location which results in a partic­
ular contour, that of a block. But the jug, the

ax,

the shoes are also matter

occurring in a form. Here, form as contour is not the result of a distribution
of matter. On the contrary, the form deterrhines the arrangement of the
matter. And not just that; the form prescribes, in each case, the kind and
selection of the matter - impermeability for the jug, adequate hardness for

9

OFF THF. B EATEN TRACK

the ax, toughness combined with flexibility for the shoes. Moreover, the in­
termingling of form and matter that is operative in these cases is controlled
beforehand by the purposes jug,

ax,

and shoes are to serve. Such service­

ability is never assigned and added on afterwards to beings of this kind. But
neither is it something which, as an end, hovers above them.
Serviceability is the basic trait from out of which these kinds of beings
look at us - that is, flash at us and thereby presence and so be the beings
they are. Both the design and the choice of material predetermined by
that design - and, therefore, the dominance of the matter-form structure arc grounded in such serviceability. A being that falls under serviceability is
always the product of a process of making. It is made as a piece of equipment
for something. Accordingly, matter and form are determinations of beings
which find their true home in the essential nature of equipment. This name
designates what is manufactured expressly for use and usage. Matter and
form are in no way original determinations belonging to the thingness of
the mere thing.
A piece of equipment, for example, the shoe-equipment, when finished,
rests in itself like the mere thing. Unlike the granite block, however, it lacks
the character of having taken shape by itself. On the other hand, it displays
an affinity with the artwork in that it is something brought forth by the
human hand. The artwork, however, through its self-sufficient presence,
resembles, rather, the mere thing which has taken shape by itself and is
never forced into being. Nonetheless, we do not count such works as mere
things. The nearest and authentic things are alway s the things of use that are
all around us. So the piece of equipment is half thing since it is characterized
by thingliness. Yet it is more, since, at the same time, it is half artwork. On
the other hand, it is less, since it lacks the self-sufficiency of the artwork.
Equipment occupies a curious position intermediate between thing and
work - if we may be permitted such a calculated ordering.
The matter-form structure, however, by which the being of a piece of
equipment is first determined, readily presents itself as the immediately
comprehensible constitution of every being because, here, productive hu­
manity is itself involved in the way in which a piece of equipment comes into
being.a Because equipment occupies an intennediate position between mere
thing and work, the suggestion arises of using equipment (the matter-fonn
structure) as the key to understanding non-equipmental beings- things and
works, and, ultimately, every kind of being.

THE O R I G I N OF THE WOR K OF ART

The inclination to take the matter-form structure to be

the constitution

of every being receives, however, particular encouragement from the fact
that, on the basis of religious- biblical- faith, the totality of beings is repre­
sented, in advance, as something created. And here, that means "made." The
philosophy of this faith can, of course, assure us that God's creative work is
to he thought of as different from the action of a craftsman. But when, at
the same time or even beforehand, in accordance with a predetermination,
taken on faith, of Thomistic philosophy for biblical interpretation, the

ens

creatum is thought out of the unity of materia and forma, then faith is inter­
preted by a philosophy whose truth is based on an unconcealment of beings
that is of another kind than the world believed in by faith. a
Now it is indeed possible that the idea of creation which is grounded
in faith can lose its power to guide our knowledge of beings as a whole.
Yet, once in place, the theological interpretation of everything that is, the
viewing of the world in terms of matter and form that was borrowed from
an alien philosophy, can remain in force. This is what happened in the
transition from the Middle Ages to the modem period. The metaphysics of
modernity is hac;ed, too, on the matter-fomt structure, a structure devised
in the Middle Ages but which itself, in its own words, merely recalls the
buried essence of

el6os and

VAT]. Thus the interpretation of the thing in

terms of matter and form, whether it remains medieval or has become
Kantian-transcendental, has become commonplace and self-evident. But
for that reason, no less than the other interpretations of the thingness of
the thing we have discussed, it represents an assault on the thing-being of
the thing.
The situation reveals itself as soon as we call actual things "mere things."
The "mere," after all, means the removal of the character of serviceability
and of being made. The mere thing is a kind of equipment that has been
denuded of its equipmental being. Its thing-being consists in what is then
left over. But the kind of being possessed by this remainder is not actually
determined. It remains questionable whether the process of stripping away
everything equipmental will ever disclose the thingness of the thing. Thus
the third interpretation of the thing, that which bases itself on the matter­
form structure, also turns out to be an assault on the thing.
The three modes of defining the thing we have here discussed conceive
it as, respectively, the hearer of traits, the unity of a sensory manifold, and as

formed matter.

In the course of the history of the truth about beings these

interpretations have also combined with each other- a matter we may now
pass over. This combination has intensified their tendency to expand in such
a way as to apply in the same way to thing, equipment, and work. In this
way they generate the mode of thinking according to which we think, not
about thing, equipment, and work, in particular, but universally, about all
beings. This long-familiar mode of thinking preconceives all our immediate
experience of beings. The preconception shackles reflection on the being
of particular beings. Thus it happens that the prevailing concepts of the
thing block the way to the thingness of the thing, the equipmentality of
equipment, and all the more to the workly character of the work.
This is the reason it is necessary to know about these concepts of the
thing, in order, thereby, to pay heed to their limitless presumption

as

well

as their semblance of self-evidence. This knowledge is all the more necessary
when we venture the attempt to bring into view and to put into words the
thingness of the thing, the equipmentality of equipment, and the workly
character of the work. For this, however, just one condition is necessary: by
keeping at a distance the preconceptions and assaults of the above modes
of thinking, to allow, for example, the thing in its thing-being, to rest in
itself. What could be easier than allowing a being to be just what it is? Or
is it rather that this task brings us to what is the most difficult, particularly
when such an intention - to allow a being to be as it is - is the opposite of
that indifference which turns its back on beings in favour of an unexamined
concept of being? We must return to the being and think about it itself in
its being. At the same time, however, we must allow it to rest in its own
nature.
This effort of thought seems to meet with its greatest resistance in at­
tempting to define the thingness of the thing, for what else could be the
reason for the failure of the above attempts? The inconspicuous thing with­
draws itself from thought in the most stubborn of ways. Or is it rather that
this self-refusal of the mere thing, this self-contained refusal to be pushed
around, belongs precisely to the essential nature of the thing? Must not,
then, this disconcerting and uncommunicative element in the essence of
the thing become intimately familiar to a thinking which tries to think the
thing? If so, we should not force our way into the thing's thingness.
The history of its interpretations outlined above, indicates beyond doubt
that the thingness of the thing is particularly difficult and rarely capable
of expression. This history coincides with the destiny in accordance with
which Western thought has hitherto thought the being of beings. This,

12

Ti l E ORIGI� OF T H E WORK OF ART

however, is not all we ascertain, for in this history we discover, at the same
time, a clue. Is it mere chance that, in the interpretation of the thing, the
interpretation which is carved out in terms of matter and fonn achieved
a particular dominance? This definition of the thing is derived from an
interpretation of the equipmentality of equipment. This being, the piece
of equipment, is, in an especial way, close to human representation, since
it achieves being through our own manufacture. This being, the piece of
equipment, with whose being we are familiar, occupies a particular position
intermediate between thing and work. Let us follow this clue and search, first
of aJI, for the equipmcntality of equipment. Perhaps we will learn from this
something about the thingliness of the thing and the worldy character of the
work. We must, however, be careful to avoid turning thing and work into a
subspecies of equipment. We will, on the other hand, ignore the possibility
that, in the way that equipment is, historically essential distinctions are
present.
But what is the path to the equipmentality of equipment? How arc we
to learn what equipment in truth is? Obviously the procedure we now need
must keep itself apart from any attempt which carries within it the assault we
have seen to be represented by the usual interpretations. The best guarantee
of that is simply to describe a piece of equipment quite apart from any
philosophical theory.
We will take as an example an everyday piece of equipment, a pair of
peasant shoes. We do not need to exhibit actual examples of this sort of
useful article in order to describe it. But since what concerns us here is
direct description, it may be helpful to facilitate their visual realization.
'Io this end, a pictorial presentation suffices. We will take a well-known

painting by van Gogh, who painted such shoes several times. But is there
a lot to be seen here? Everyone knows what shoes are like. If they arc not
wooden or bast shoes, there will be leather soles and uppers held together
by stitching and nails. Equipment of this kind serves as footwear. Whether
it is for work in the field or for dancing, material and fonn vary according
to use.
Correct statements such as these only tell us what we already know: the
equipmentality of equipment consists in its utility. But what about this utility
itselt? In understanding it do we already understand the equipmcntality of
equipment?

In order for this to be so, must we not look out for the useful

piece of equipment in its use? The peasant woman wears her shoes in the
field. Only then do they become what they are. They are all the more
genuinely so the less the peasant woman thinks of her shoes while she is

13

OFF TH E B EATEI': TRACK

working, or even looks at them, or is aware of them in any way at all. This
is how the shoes actually serve. It must be in this process of usage that the
equipmentality of the equipment actually confronts us.
But on the contrary, as long as we only imagine a pair of shoes in general,
or merely look at the shoes

as

they stand there in the picture, empty and

unused, we will never learn what the equipmentaJ being of equipment in
truth is. From van Gogh's painting we cannot even tell where these shoes
are.3 There is nothing surrounding this pair of peasant shoes to which and
within which they could belong; only an undefined space. Not even clods
of earth from the field or from the country path stick to them, which could
at least point toward their use. A pair of peasant shoes and nothing more.
And yet.
From out of the dark opening of the well-worn insides of the shoes the toil
of the worker's tread stares forth. In the crudely solid heaviness of the shoes
accumulates the tenacity of the slow trudge through the far-stretching and
ever-uniform furrows of the field swept by a raw wind. On the leather lies
the dampness and richness of the soil. Under the soles slides the loneliness
of the field-path as evening falls. The shoes vibrate with the silent call of
the earth, its silent gift of the ripening grain, its unexplained self-refusal in
the wintry field. This equipment is pervaded by uncomplaining worry as to
the certainty of bread, wordless joy at having once more withstood want,
trembling before the impending birth, and shivering at the surrounding
menace of death. This equipment belongs
in the

wodd of the peasant

to the en1'th and finds protection

woman. From out of this protected belonging

the equipment itself rises to its resting-within-itself.
But perhaps it is only in the picture that we notice all this about the shoes.
The peasant woman, by contrast, merely wears them. If only this simple
wearing were that simple. W henever in the late evening she takes off the
shoes, in deep but healthy tiredness, and in the still dark dawn reaches for
them once again, or passes them by on the holiday, she knows all this without
observation or reflection. The equipmentality of equipment consists indeed
in its usefulness. But this ito;clf rests in the fullness of an essential being of
the equipment. We call this reliability. In virtue of this reliability the peasant
woman is admitted into the silent call of the earth; in virtue of the reliability
of the equipment she is certain of her world. World and earth exist for her
and those who share her mode of being only hereh- in the equipment. We

THE O R I G I N O F Til E WOR K OF ART

say "only" but this is a mistake; for it is the reliability of the equipment which
first gives the simple world its security and assures the earth the freedom of
its steady pressure.
The equipmental being of the equipment, its reliability, keeps all things
gathered within itself, each in its own manner and to its own extent. The
usefulness of the equipment is, however, only the necessary consequence of
reliability. The former vibrates in the latter and would be nothing without it.
The individual piece of equipment becomes worn out and used up. But also,
customary usage itself falls into disuse, becomes ground down and merely
habitual.

In this way equipmental being withers away, sinks to the level of

mere equipment. Such dwindling of equipmcntal being is the disappearance
of its reliability. Such dwindling, however, which gives things of use that
boringly oppressive usualness, is only one more testament to the original
nature of cquipmental being. The worn-out usualness of the equipment
then obtrudes as the sole kind of being that is (it seems) exclusively its own.
::'\:ow nothing but sheer utility remains visible. It creates the appearance that
the origin of equipment lies in a mere fabrication which gives form to some
bit of matter.

In fact, however, equipment acquires its cquipmcntal being

from a more distant source. Matter and form and the difference between
them have a deeper origin.
The repose of equipment resting in itself consists in reliability. It is here
that we first catch sight of what equipment, in truth, is. Yet we still know
nothing of that for which we were originally looking: the thingness of the
thing. And of that for which we are actually and solely looking- the workly
character of the work in the sense of artwork- we know absolutely nothing.
Or have we now, rather, unexpectedly and, as it were, in passing, learnt
something about the work-being of the work?
The equipmental being of equipment was discovered. But how? �ot
through the description and explanation of a pair of shoes actually present.
Not through a report on the process of shoemaking. And not through the
observation of the actual use of shoes as it occurs here and there. Rather, the
equipmental being of equipment was only discovered by bringing ourselves
before the van Gogh painting. It is this that spoke. In proximity to the
work we were suddenly somewhere other than we are usually accustomed
to be.
The artwork let us know what the shoes, in truth, arc. To suppose that
our description, ao; a subjective action, had first depicted everything thus and
then projected into the painting would be the worst kind of self-delusion.
If there is anything questionable here it is only this: that in the proximity of

OFF Ti l E BEATE� TRACK

the work we have experienced too little, and what we have experienced has
been described too crudely and hastily. Above all, however, the work did
not serve, as might at first seem, merely to make it easier to visualize what
a piece of equipment is. Rather, what comes to explicit appearance first and
only through the work is the equipmcntal being of the equipment.
What is happening here? What is at work in the work? Van Gogh's
painting is the disclosure of what the equipment, the pair of peasant shoes,
in truth

is. This

being steps forward into the unconcealment of its being.

The unconcealment of beings is what the Greeks called 6:M8e1a. We say
"truth" and think little enough in using the word. In the work, when there
is a disclosure of the being as what and how it is, there is a happening of
truth at work.
In the work of art, the truth of the being has set itself to work. "Set"

means here: to bring to stand. In the work, a being, a pair of peasant shoes,
comes to stand in the light of its being. The being of the being comes into
the constancy of its shining.
The essential nature of art would then be this: the setting-itself-to-work
of the truth of beings. Yet until now art has had to do with the beautiful and
with beauty - not with truth. Those arts which bring such works forth arc
called the beautiful or fine arts [die schiinrn Kiinste] in contrast to the crafts or
industrial arts

[dm Handwerklichm Kii11Sten] which manufacture equipment.

In the fine arts, the art is not itself beautiful, but is, rather, called so because
it brings forth the beautiful. Truth, by contrast, belongs to logic. But beauty
is the preserve of aesthetics.
Yet perhaps the statement that art is truth's setting-itself-to-work seeks
to revive the view, now fortunately abandoned, that art is the imitation and
depiction of reality? The repetition of what is present at hand requires, to he
sure, correspondence to beings, appropriateness to them: the Middle Ages
spoke of adaequatio, Aristotle already spoke of OIJOiwoJ�. Correspondence to
beings has long been taken to be the essence of truth. But do we then mean
that this painting by van Gogh depicts a pair of peasant shoes that are actually
present and count, therefore, as a work because it docs so successfully? Do
we think that the painting takes a likeness from the real and transposes it
into an artistic . . . production? By no means.
The work, then, is not concerned with the reproduction of a particular
being that has at some time been actually present. Rather, it is concerned
to reproduce the general essence of things. But where, then, is this gen­
eral essence and how should it be for the artwork to correspond to or
agree with it? With what essence of what thing should the Greek temple

T i l E O R I GI N O F T H E WORK OF ART

agree? Could anyone maintain the impossible position that the Idea of
Temple is represented in the temple? And yet in this work, if it is a work,
truth sets itself to work. Or take Holderlin's hymn "The Rhine." \Vhat
is given beforehand to the poet, and how is it given, so that it can be
given once again in the poem? It may be that in the case of this hymn
and similar poems, the idea of a copy -relation between a beautiful reality
and the artwork clearly fails; yet the idea that the work is a copy seems to
be confirmed in the best possible way by C. F. Mey er'sz poem "The Roman
Fountain"

The Roman fountain
The jet ascends, and falling fills
The marble basin round.
Veiling itself, this over-flows
Into a second basin's ground.
The second gives, it becomes too rich,
To a third its bubbling Aood,
And each at once receives and gives
And streams and rests.

Der riimische Bnmnen
Aufsteigt der Strahl und fallend gie6t
Er voll der Marmorschale Rund
Die, sich verschleiemd, iiberflie6t
In einer zweiten Schale Grund;
Der drinen wallend ihre Flut,
Und jede nimmt und gibt zugleich
Und stromt und ruht.
This, however, is neither a poetic depiction of an actual fountain nor
the reproduction of the general essence of a Roman fountain. Yet truth is
set into the work. \Vhat is the truth that happens in the work? Can truth
happen at all and be, therefore, historical? Yet truth, it is said, is something
timeless and supratemporal.
We seek the reality of the artwork in order really to find, there, the
art prevailing within it. The thingly substructure is what proved to be the
most evident reality in the work. To grasp this thingly element the tra­
ditional concepts of the thing are inadequate; for these themselves fail to
grasp the essence of the thingly. The dominant concept, thing as formed
matter, is taken not from the essence of the thing but from the essence of
equipment. \Vhat has also become clear is that for a long time the being
of equipment has commanded a peculiar preeminence in the interpretation
of beings. This - the not explicitly thought out preeminence of the being

17

OFF THE B EATE:-.1 TRACK

of equipment - indicated the need to pose the question of equipmentality
anew while avoiding the familiar interpretations.
We allow a work to tell us what equipment is. By this means, it came to
light what is at work in the work: the opening up of beings in their being,
the happening of truth. If, however, the reality of the work is determined
by nothing other than what is at work in the work, how do things stand
with regard to our project of searching out the real artwork in its reality?
As long as we supposed the reality of the work to lie primarily in its thingly

substructure, we went astray. We now confront a remarkable result of our
considerations - if "result" is what it can be called. Two points become clear.
First, the prevailing concepts of the thing represent an inadequate means
of grasping the thingly clement in the work.
Second, the thingly substructure, which we wanted to treat as the most
evident reality of the work does not, in that way, belong to the work at all.
As soon as we become fixated on finding such an element in the work we

have unwittingly taken the work as equipment to which we then ascribe a
superstructure supposed to contain what is artistic about it. But the work is
not a piece of equipment that is fitted out in addition with aesthetic worth
adhering to it. The work is no more that than the mere thing is a piece of
equipment minus the marks of authentic equipmentality - usefulness and
being made.
Our posing the question of the work has been disturbed by the fact
that we asked, not about the work but, rather, half about a thing and half
about equipment. That, however, was not a way of raising the question
first developed by us. This way of raising the question belongs, rather, to
aesthetics. The way in which aesthetics is disposed, in advance, to view
the artwork stands within the dominion of the traditional interpretation of
beings in general. But to disturb this familiar mode of questioning is not
what is essential. What really matters is that we open our eyes to the fact
that the workliness of the work, the equipmentality of equipment, and the
thingliness of the thing come nearer to

us

only when we think the being of

beings. A condition of this is that the limits imposed by self-evidence first
fall away and that current pseudo-concepts be set aside. This is why we had
to take a roundabout route. But it brings

us

directly onto the path that may

lead to a determination of the thingly aspect of the work. The thingly in
the work should not be denied out of existence; rather, given that it belongs
already to the work-being of the work, it must be thought out of that work­
being. If this is so, then the path to the determination of the thingly reality
of the work runs not from thing to work but from work to thing.

18

THE O R I G I N OF THE WORK OF ART

The artwork opens up, in its own way, the being of beings. This opening
up, i.e., unconcealing, i.e., the truth of beings, happens in the work. In the
artwork, the truth of beings has set itself to the work. Art is the setting­
itself-to-work of truth. What is truth itself, that it happens, • at times, as
art? What is this setting-itself-to-work?

THE WORK AND TRl7TH
The origin of the artwork is

art.

But what is art? Art is real in the artwork.

That is the reason we look, first of all, for the reality of the work. In what
does it consist? Thingliness is exhibited by artworks universally, albeit in
very different ways. The attempt to comprehend the thingly-character of
the work via the usual concepts of the thing failed. It failed not only because
these concepts of the thing failed to grasp the thingly, but also because, by
asking about the work's thingly substructure, we forced it into a precon­
ceived framework which obstructs access to the work-being of the work.
Nothing can be discovered about the thingly aspect of the work until the
pure standing-in-itself of the work has clearly shown itself.
But is the work in itself ever acces.'iible? In order for this to happen it
would be necessary to remove the work from all relation to anything other
than itself in order to let it stand on its own and for itself alone. But that is

already the innermost intention of the artist. Through him, the work is to be
released into its purest standing-in-itself. Precisely in great art (which is all
we are concerned with here) the artist remains something inconsequential in
comparison with the work - almost like a passageway which, in the creative
process, destroys itself for the sake of the coming forth of the work.
Well, then, the works themselves are located and hang in collections and
exhibitions. But are they themselves, in this context, are they the works
they are, or are they, rather, objects of the art business? The works are
made available for the public and private enjoyment of art. Official agencies
assume responsibility for the care and maintenance of the works. Art con­
noisseurs and critics busy themselves with them. The art dealer looks after
the market. The art-historical researcher turns the works into the objects
of a science. But in all this many-sided activity do we ever encounter the
work itself?

their own essential space. However high their status and power to impress,
however well-preserved and however certain their interpretation, their re­
location in a collection has withdrawn them from their world. Yet even when
we try to cancel or avoid such displacement of the work - by, for example,
visiting the temple at its site in Paestum or Bamberg cathedral in its square ­
the world of the work that stands there has disintegrated.
World-withdrawal and world-decay can never be reversed. The works
are no longer what they were. The works themselves, it is true, are what we
encounter; yet they themselves are what has been. As what has been they
confront us within the realm of tradition and conservation. Henceforth,
they remain nothing but objects of this kind. That they stand there before
us is indeed still a consequence of their former standing-in-themselves. But
it is no longer the same as that. Their former self-sufficiency has deserted
them. The whole of the art industry, even if taken to extremes and with
everything carried out for the sake of the works themselves, reaches only
as far as the object-being of the works. This, however, does not constitute
their work-being.
But does the work remain a work when it stands outside all relations?
Does it not belong to the work to stand in relations? Of course - except
that it remains to be asked in which relations it stands.
Where does a work belong? As a work, it belongs uniquely within the
region it itself opens up. For the work-being of the work presences in and
only in such opening up. We said that in the work, the happening of truth
is at work. The reference to van Gogh's picture tried to point to such a
happening. The question arose, in this connection, as to what truth might
be and how truth could happen.
We pose now the question about truth with the work in view.

In order,

however, to become more aware of what the question involves, it will be
necessary to make the happening of truth in the work visible anew. For
this attempt, let

us

choose a work that cannot be regarded as a work of

representational art.
A building, a Greek temple, portrays nothing. It simply stands there in

the middle of the rocl)', fissured valley. The building encloses the figure
of a god and within this concealment, allows it to stand forth through the
columned hall within the holy precinct. Through the temple, the god is
present in the temple. This presence of the god is, in itself, the extension
and delimitation of the precinct as something holy. The temple and its
precinct do not, however, float off into the indefinite. It is the temple work
that first structures and simultaneously gathers around itself the unity of

20

Ti l E O R I G I N OF Ti l E WORK OF ART

those paths and relations in which birth and death, disaster and blessing,
victory and disgrace, endurance and decline acquire for the hwnan being
the shape of its destiny. The all-governing expanse of these open relations is
the world of this historical people. From and within this expanse the people
first returns to itself for the completion of its vocation.
Standing there, the building rests on the rocky ground. This resting of
the work draws out of the rock the darkness of its unstructured yet unforced
support. Standing there, the building holds its place against the storm raging
above it and so first makes the storm visible in its violence. The gleam and
luster of the stone, though apparently there only by the grace of the sun, in
fact first brings forth the light of day, the breadth of the sky, the darkness
of night. The temple's firm towering makes visible the invisible space of
the air. The steadfastness of the work stands out against the surge of the
tide and, in its own repose, brings out the raging of the surf. Tree, grass,
eagle and bull, snake and cricket first enter their distinctive shapes and
thus come to appearance as what they are. Early on, the Greeks called this
coming forth and rising up in itself and in all things

<l>va1s. At the same time

cj>va1s lights up that on which man bases his dwelling. We call this the earth.
What this word means here is far removed from the idea of a mass of matter
and from the merely astronomical idea of a planet. Earth is that in which
the arising of everything that arises is brought back - as, indeed, the very
thing that it is- and sheltered.

In the things that arise the earth presences

as the protecting one.
Standing there, the temple work opens up a world while, at the same
time, setting this world back onto the earth which itself first comes forth as
homeland

[heimatliche Grund]. But men and animals, plants and things, are

never present and familiar as unalterable things fortuitously constituting
a suitable environment for the temple that, one day, is added to what is
already present. We will get closer to what

is

if we think everything in

reverse•- asswning, of course, that we have, in advance, an eye for how
differently everything then faces us. A mere reversal, made for its own sake,
reveals nothing.
Standing there, the temple first gives to things their look, and to men
their outlook on themselves. This view remains open as long as the work
is a work, as long as the god has not fled from it. So it is, too, with the
sculpture of the god which the victor of the athletic games dedicates to
him. The work is not a portrait intended to make it easier to recognize
•

OFF T i l E BEATE:-.l TRACK

what the god looks like. It is, rather, a work which allows the god himself to
presence and is, therefore, the god himself. The same is true of the linguistic
work. In the tragedy, nothing is staged or displayed theatrically. Rather, the
battle of the new gods against the old is being fought.

In that the linguistic

work arises from the speech of the people, it does not talk about this battle.
Rather, it transforms that speech so that now every essential word fights
the battle and puts up for decision what is holy and what unholy, what is
great and what small, what is brave and what cowardly, what is noble and
what fugitive, what is master and what slave (cf. Heraclitus, Fragment 53 in
Diels,

Frap;mente der VorsokratikerJ).

In what, then, does the work-being of the work consist? Keeping in steady
view what has just been - roughly enough - outlined, two essential features
of the work may have become immediately clearer. \Vith these we depart
from the long-familiar foreground of the work's work-being, its thingliness,
which underpins our usual relationship to the work.
When a work is brought into a collection or placed in an exhibition,
we also say that it is "set up," but this setting up is essentially different
from the construction of a building, the raising of a statue, the presen­
tation of a tragedy in the holy festival. The setting up we refer to is an
erecting in the sense of dedication and praise. Here, "setting up" no longer
means merely putting in place. To dedicate means to consecrate

[heiligen],

in the sense that, in the workly construction, the holy

is opened

[Heilige]

up as the holy and the god is called forth into the openness of its presence.
Praise belongs to dedication as doing honor to the dignity and splendor of
the god. Dignity and splendor are not properties beside and behind which
there stands, additionally, the god. Rather, it is in the dignity, in the splen­
dor, that the god comes to presence.

In

the reflected glory of this splen­

dor there glows, i.e., illuminates itself, what we called "world." To erect

[Er-richten]

means: to open up the right in the sense of the measure which

guides us along, in which form that which is essential gives its guidance.
Why, however, is the setting up of the work an erecting that consecrates
and praises? Because, in its work-being, the work demands it. How does
the work come to demand such a setting up? Because it itself, in its own
work-being, is something that sets up. What is it that the work, as work, sets
up? Rising-up-within-itself the work opens up a world and keeps it abidingly
in force.
To be a work means: to set up a world. But what is this item, a world?
We gave some intimation of an answer in talking about the temple. On the
path we must here follow, the nature of world can only be indicated. Even

22

THE ORIGIN OF T i l E WORK OF ART

this indication is confined to warding off that which might initially distort
our view into the essence of things.
World is not a mere collection of the things - countable and uncountable,
known and unknown - that are present at hand. Neither is world a merely
imaginary framework added by our representation to the sum of things that
are present. Wodd worlds, and is more fully in being than all those tangible
and perceptible things in the midst of which we take ourselves to be at home.
World is never an object that stands before us and can be looked at. World is
that always-nonobjectual to which we arc subject as long as the paths of birth
and death, blessing and curse, keep us transported into being." Wherever
the essential decisions of our history are made, wherever we take them over
or abandon them, wherever they go unrecognized or arc brought once more
into question, there the world worlds. The stone is world-less. Similarly,
plants and animals have no world; they belong, rather, to the hidden throng
of an environment into which they have been put. The peasant woman,
by contrast, possesses a world, since she stays in the openness of beings.
In its reliability, equipment imparts to this world a necessity and proximity
of its own. By the opening of a world, all things gain their lingering and
hastening, their distance and proximity, their breadth and their limits.

In

worlding there gathers that spaciousness from out of which the protective
grace of the gods is gifted or is refused. Even the doom of the absence of
the god is a way in which world worlds.
A work, by being a work, allows a space for that spaciousness. "1h allow
a space" here means, in particular: to make free the free of the open and to
install this free place in its structure. This in-stalling
as the erection

mentioned earlier. As a work, the work holds

open the open of a world. Yet the setting up of a world is only the first of
the essential traits of the work-being of the work that we need to discuss
here. The second essential trait which belongs to it we shall attempt to make
visible by starting, in the same manner as before, from the foreground of
the work.
When a work is brought forth out of this or that work-material - stone,
wood, metal, color, language, tone - we say that it is made, set forth

[hergeste/Jt]

out of it. But just as the work required a setting up, in the

sense of consecrating-praising erection (since the work-being of the work
consisted in a setting up of world), so a setting forth

[Hnrte/Jung]

is also

necessary, since the work-being of the work has itself the character of a

setting forth. It belongs to the essence of a work, as a work, that it makes,
sets forth. But what is it that the work sets forth? We will only discover this
by investigating what, in a superficial and everyday sense, is referred to as
the making or production of works.
«> the work-being belongs the setting up of a world. Thinking of it

from within this perspective, what is the nature of that which one usually
calls the "work-material"? Because it is determined through usefulness and
serviceability, equipment takes that of which it consists into its service.
the manufacture of equipment - for example, an

ax

In

- the stone is used and

used up. It disappears into usefulness. The le.'is re.'iistance the material puts
up to being submerged in the equipmental being of the equipment the more
suitable and the better it is. On the other hand, the temple work, in setting
up a world, does not let the material disappear; rather, it allows it to come
forth for the very first time, to come forth, that is, into the open of the world
of the work. The rock comes to bear and to rest and so first becomes rock;
the metal comes to glitter and shimmer, the colors to shine, the sounds to
ring, the word to speak. a All this comes forth as the work sets itself back into
the massiveness and heaviness of the stone, into the firmness and flexibility
of the wood, into the hardness and gleam of the ore, into the lightening and
darkening of color, into the ringing of sound, and the naming power of the
word.
That into which the work sets itself back, and thereby allows to come
forth, is what we called "the earth." Earth is the coming-forth-concealing

is effortless and untiring. On and in the earth, historical man founds his

Why, however, must this setting forth of earth happen in such a way
that the work sets itself back into it? What is the earth, that it reaches the
unconcealed in just this manner? The stone presses downwards and mani­
fests its heaviness. But while this heaviness weighs down on us, at the same
time, it denies us any penetration into it. If we attempt such penetration by

smashing the rock, then it shows us its pieces but never anything inward,
anything that has been opened up. The stone has instantly withdrawn again
into the same dull weight and mass of its fragments. If we try to grasp the
stone's heaviness in another way, by placing it on a pair of scales, then we
bring its heaviness into the calculable fonn of weight. This perhaps very
precise detem1ination of the stone is a number, but the heaviness of the
weight has escaped us. Color shines and wants only to shine. If we try to
make it comprehensible by analyzing it into numbers of oscillations it is
gone. It shows itself only when it remains undisclosed and unexplained.
Earth shatters every attempt to penetrate it. It turns every merely calcula­
tional intrusion into an act of destruction. Though such destruction may
be accompanied by the appearance of mastery and progress in the form of
the technological-scientific objectification of nature, this mastery remains,
nonetheless, an impotence of the will. The earth is openly i lluminated as
itself only where it is apprehended and preserved as the essentially undis­
closable, as that which withdraws from every disclosure, in other words,
keeps itself constantly closed up. All the things of the earth, the earth ito;elf
in its entirety, flow together in reciprocal harmony. But this confluence is
no blurring of outlines. What flows here is the self-sustaining stream of
boundary-setting, a stream which bounds everything that presences into its
presence. So in every self-secluding thing there is the same not-knowing­
one-another. The earth is the essentially self-secluding. To set forth the
earth means: to bring it into the open as the self-secluding.
This setting forth of the earth is what the work achieves by setting itself
back into the earth. The self-seclusion of the earth is, however, no uni­
form, inflexible staying-in-the-dark

[Verhnngenbleiben], hut unfolds, rather,

into an inexhaustible richness of simple modes and shapes. To be sure,
the sculptor uses stone just as, in his own way, the mason uses it. But
he does not use it up. That can be, in a certain sense, said of the work
only when it fails. To be sure, the painter, too, makes use of pigment; he
uses it, however, in such a way that the colors are not used up but begin,
rather, for the first time, to shine. To be sure, the poet, too, uses words,
not, however, like ordinary speakers and writers who must use them up, but
rather in such a way that only now does the word become and remain truly
a word.
Nowhere in a work is there any trace of work-material. It is even doubt­

ful whether, in the essential determination· of equipment, that in which it
consists is encountered in its equipmental essence when it is described as
matter.

OFF Ti l E BEATEN TRACK

The setting up of a world and the setting forth of earth are two essential
traits belonging to the work-being of the work. Within the unity of that
work-being, however, they belong together.a This unity is what we seek

when we reflect on the self-sufficiency of the work and try to express in
words the closed, unitary repose of this resting-in-itself.

But, in the essential traits just mentioned, if our account is anywhere near
the mark, what we have made visible in the work is by no means a repose but
rather a happening: for what is rest if not the opposite of movement? It is,
at any rate, not an opposite which excludes, but rather one which includes
movement. Only what moves can rest. The mode of rest is determined by the
mode of movement.

In motion that is the mere change of place of a body,

rest is, admittedly, only the limiting case of motion. When rest includes
motion, there can be a rest which is an inner collection of motion. Such rest
is, therefore, a state of extreme agitation - presupposing that the kind of
motion in question requires such rest. The repose of the work that rests in
itself is, however, of this sort. We will come, therefore, into the proximity
of this repose if we can manage to grasp the movement of the happening
in the work-being of the work as a unity. We ask: what relationship do the
setting up of a world and the setting forth of the earth exhibit in the work
itself?
The world is the self-opening openness of the broad paths of simple
and essential decisions in the destiny of a historical people. The earth is
the unforced coming forth of the continually self-closing, and in that way,
self-sheltering. World and earth are essentially different and yet never sep­
arated from one another. World is grounded on earth, and earth rises up
through world. But the relation between world and earth never atrophies
into the empty unity ofopposites unconcerned with one another. In its rest­
ing upon earth the world strives to surmount it. As the self-opening it will
tolerate nothing closed. As the sheltering and concealing, however, earth
tends always to draw the world into itself and to keep it there.
The opposition of world and earth is strife. We would, to be sure, all
too easily falsify the essence of the strife were we to conflate that essence
with discord and dispute, and to know it, therefore, only as disruption and
destruction. ln essential strife, however, the opponents raise each other into
the self-assertion

[Selbstbehauptung]

of their essences. This self-assertion of

essence is, however, never a rigid fixation on some condition that happens
to be the case, but rather a surrendering into the hidden originality of the
•

z6

THE ORIGII': OF THE WORK OF ART

source of one's own being.

In the struggle, each opponent carries the other

beyond itself. As a consequence, the strife becomes ever more intense as
striving, and ever more authentically what it is. The more intransigently
the strife outdoes itself on its own part, the more uncompromisingly do the
opponents admit themselves into the intimacy of their simple belonging to
one another. The earth cannot do without the openness of world if i t is
to appear in the liberating surge of its self-closedness. World, on the other
hand, cannot float away from the earth if, as the prevailing breadth and path
of all essential destiny, it is to ground itself on something decisive.

In

setting up world and setting forth earth the work instigates this

strife. But this does not happen so that the work can simultaneously ter­
minate and settle the conflict in an insipid agreement, but rather so that
the strife remains a strife. By setting up a world and setting forth the
earth, the work accomplishes this strife. The work-being of the work con­
sists in fighting the fight between world and earth. It is because the strife
reaches its peak in the simplicity of intimacy that the unity of the work
happens in the fighting of the fight. The fighting of the fight is the con­
tinually self-surpassing gathering of the agitation of the work. The repose
of the work that rests in itself thus has its essence in the intimacy of the
struggle.
It is from out of this repose of the work that we are first able to see what
is at work in the work. Until now the assertion that truth is set to work
in the artwork has remained a merely provisional one. In what way does
truth happen in the artwork, i.e., now, in what way docs truth happen in the
fighting of the fight between world and earth? What is truth?
How meager and truncated is our knowledge of the essence of truth is
shown by the thoughtlessness with which we use this fundamental word.
Mostly, we use "truth" to mean this or that particular truth. It means, in
other words, something that is true. A piece of knowledge, articulated in a
statement is an example of this kind of thing. It is not merely statements,
however, but also things that we call "true" - true as opposed to fake gold.
"'lrue," here, is equivalent to "genuine" or "real" gold. What docs this talk
of "reality" mean? To us it means that which, in truth, is. That which is true
is what corresponds to reality, and reality is that which, in truth, is. Once
again the circle has closed.
What docs "in truth" mean? "Iruth is the essence ofwhat is true. What is it
we are thinking of in speaking of"esscncc"? Usually, it is that common thing
in which everything that is true agrees. An essence is discovered in generic
and universal concepts which represent the one that holds indifferently for

OFF Ti l E B E ATEN TRACK

the many. This in-different essence (essentiality in the sense of essentia) is,
however, only the inessential essence. In what does the essential essence of
something consist? Presumably it lies in that which a being, in truth, is. The
true essence of something is detennined by its true being, by the truth of
each being. At the moment, however, what we are looking for is not the
truth of essence but rather the essence of truth. A curious entanglement
reveals itself here. Is it a mere curiosity, is it the vacuous hair-splitting of a
playing with concepts, or is it - an abyss?
'Ihnh means the essence of what is true. We will think it from out of the
memory of the word used by the Greeks. 'AAT]6eJa means the unconcealment
of beings. But is that really a definition of the essence of truth? Are we not
passing off a mere change of words - "unconcealment" instead of"truth" - as
a characterization of the fact of the matter? Certainly we do not get beyond
a change of names so long as we fail to experience what must happen for us
to be compelled to speak the

essence of truth in the word "unconcealment."

Does this require a revival of Greek philosophy? Not at all. A revival,
even were such an impossibility possible, would not help us. For the hidden
history of Greek philosophy consists from its beginning in this: that it does
not measure up to the essence of truth that lit up in the word

Q;\1]6eJa, and

so, of necessity, has misdirected its knowing and saying about the essence
of truth more and more into the discussion of the derivative essence of
truth.

In

the thought of the Greeks and all the more completely so in

the philosophy that followed, the essence of truth as

Q;\t;6eJa remained

unthought. U nconcealment is, for thought, what is most concealed in Greek
existence. At the same time, however, it is that which, from early times, has
determined the presence of everything present.
But why can we not be satisfied with the essence of truth that has, by
now, been familiar to us for centuries? Truth means, today, as it has done for
a long time, agreement of knowledge with the facts.

In order, however, for

knowledge, and for the sentence that fonns and expresses it, to correspond
to the facts it is necessary, first of all, that the fact which is to be binding
on the sentence show itself to be such. And how is it to show itself if it is
unable to stand out of concealment, unable to stand in the unconcealed? A
statement is true by conforming to the unconcealed, i.e., to that which is
true. The truth ofstatements is always, and is nothing but, such correctness.
The critical concepts of truth which, since Descartes start out from truth as
certainty, are mere variations on the definition of truth as correctness. This
familiar essence of truth, truth as the correctness of representation, stands
and falls with truth as the unconcealment of beings.

zS

THE ORIGIN OF THE WORK OF ART

When, here and elsewhere, we conceive of truth as unconcealment, we
are not merely taking refuge in a more literal formulation of the Greek
word. We are reflecting upon that which, unexperienced and unthought,
underlies our familiar and therefore worn out essence of truth in the sense
of correctness. From time to time we bring ourselves to concede that, of
course, in order to verify and grasp the correctness (truth) of an assertion
we must return to something that is already manifest. This presupposi­
tion, we concede, is unavoidable. But as long as we talk and think in this
way, we understand truth merely as correctness. This requires, of course,
a still further presupposition, one that we just make, heaven knows how
or why.
But it is not we who presuppose the unconcealment of beings. Rather, the
unconcealment of beings (bein!f) puts us into such an essence that all our
representing remains set into, and in accordance with, unconcealmcnt. It is
not only the case that that h1 conformity with

which a cognition orders itself
region in which

must already be somehow unconcealed. Rather, the whole

this "conformity with something" occurs must already have happened as
a whole within the undisclosed; and this holds equally of that for which
a particular correspondence of a statement to the facts becomes manifest.
With all our correct representations we would be nothing - we could never
make the presupposition of there being something manifest to which we
conform ourselves - if the unconcealment of beings had not already set us
forth into that illuminated realm" in which every being stands for us and
from which it withdraws.
But how does this happen? How does truth happen as this unconceal­
ment? First, however, we must make it clearer what this unconcealment
itself is.
Things arc, and human beings, gifts, and sacrifices arc, animals and plants
are, equipment and work arc. The being stands in being. Through being
passes a coven fate ordained between the godly and what goes against the
godly. There is much in beings man cannot master. But little comes to be
known. The known remains an approximation, what is mastered insecure.
Never is a being - as it might, all too easily, appear - something of our
making or merely our representation. When we contemplate this whole
in its unity we grasp, it seems, all that is - though we grasp it crudely
enough.

And yet: beyond beings - though before rather than apart from them -

there is still something other that happens. • In the midst of beings as a whole

an open place comes to presence. There is a clearing. Thought from out of
beings, it is more in being than is the being. This open center is, therefore,
not surrounded by beings. Rather, this illuminating center itself encircles
all beings - like the nothing that we scarcely know.
The being can only be, as a being, if it stands within, and stands out
within, what is illuminated in this clearing. Only this clearing grants us hu­
man beings access to those beings that we ourselves are not and admittance
to the being that we ourselves are. Thanks to this clearing, beings are uncon­
cealed in certain and changing degrees. But even to be concealed is something
the being can only do within the scope of the illuminated. Each being which
we encounter and which encounters us maintains this strange opposition of
presence in that at the same time it always holds itself back in a conceal­
ment. Concealment, however, reigns in the midst of beings, in a twofold
manner.
Beings refuse themselves to us down to that one and seemingly most
trivial feature which we meet most immediately when all we can say of
a being is that it is. Concealment as refusal is not primarily or only the
limit of knowledge in each particular case; it is, rather, the beginning of
the clearing of what is illuminated. But concealment, though of course of
another sort, also occurs within the illuminated. Beings push themselves in
front of others, the one hides the other, this casts that into shadow, a few
obstruct many, on occasion one denies all. Concealment, here, is not simple
refusal. Rather, a being indeed appears but pre.'ients itself as other than
it is.
This concealment is an obstructing [ Vente/1m]. If beings did not obstruct
one another we could not err in seeing and doing, we could not go astray
and transgress, and, in particular, could not overreach ourselves. That, as
appearance, the being can deceive

us

is the condition of the possibility of

our deceiving ourselves rather than the other way round.
Concealment can be either a refusal or merely an obstructing. We are
never really certain whether it is the one or the other. Concealment conceals
and obstructs itself. This means: the open place in the midst of beings, the
clearing, is never a fixed stage with a permanently raised l."U rtain on which
the play of beings enacts itself. Rather, the clearing happens only as this
twofold concealment. The unconcealment of beings - this is never a state
•

JO

T i l E ORIGIN OF THE WORK OF ART

that is merely present but rather a happening• . Unconcealment (truth) is a
property neither of the facts, in the sense of beings, nor of statements.
In the immediate circle of beings we believe ourselves to be at home. The
being is familiar, reliable, ordinary. Nonetheless, the clearing is pervaded
by a constant concealment in the twofold form of refusal and obstructing.
Fundamentally, the ordinary is not ordinary; it is extra-ordinary, uncanny

[un-geheue1·]. The essence of truth, i.e., unconcealment, is ruled throughout
by a denial. This denial is, however, neither a defect nor a fault - as if truth
were a pure unconcealment that has rid itself of everything concealed. If
truth could accomplish this it would no longer be itself.

Denial, by way of
the twofold co1ICealing, belongs to the essence oftruth as unconcealment. Truth, in
its essence, is un-truth. We put it this way emphatically to indicate, with
a perhaps off-putting directness, that refusal in the mode of concealing is
intrinsic to unconcealment as clearing. On the other hand, the sentence
"the essence of truth is un-truth" should not be taken to claim that truth,
fundamentally, is falsehood. Equally little does it mean that truth is never
itself but, dialectically represented, is always its opposite as well.
Truth presences

as

itself only because the concealing denial, as refusal,

is the continuing origin of all clearing but yet, as obstructing, metes out to
all clearing the rigorous severity of error. "Concealing denial" is intended
to denote that opposition which exists within the essence of truth between
clearing and concealment. It is the conflict of the primal strife. The essence
of truth is in itself the ur-strife

[Ur.111·eit] b

in which is won that open cen­

ter within which beings stand, and from out of which they withdraw into
themselves.
This open happens in the midst of beings. It displays an essential trait
we have already mentioned. To the open belongs a world and the earth. But
world is not simply the open which corresponds to the clearing, earth is not
simply the closed that corresponds to concealment. World, rather, is the
clearing of the paths of the essential directives with which every decision
complies. Every decision, however, is grounded in something that cannot
be mastered, something concealed, something disconcerting. Otherwise it
would never he a decision. Earth is not simply the closed hut that which
rises up as self-closing. World and earth are essentially in conflict, intrin­
sically belligerent. Only as such do they enter the strife of clearing and
concealing.

OFF THE BEATE� TRACK

Earth rises up through world and world grounds itself on the earth only
insofar as truth happens as the ur-strife between clearing and concealment.
But how does truth happen? We answer: it happens in a few essential ways.�
One of these ways in which truth happens is the work-being of the work.
Setting up a world and setting forth the earth, the work is the fighting of
that fight in which the disclosure of beings as a whole - truth - is won.
Truth happens in the temple's standing there. This does not mean that
something is correctly portrayed and reproduced here but rather that that
which is as a whole is brought into unconcealment and held there. "lo hold"
originally means "to watch over [hiiten] ." Truth happens in van Gogh's paint­
ing. That does not mean that something present is correctly portrayed; it
means, rather, that in the manifestation of the equipmental being of the
shoe-equipment, that which is as a whole - world and earth in their coun­
terplay - achieves unconcealment.
In the work truth is at work - not, that is to say, merely something that
is true. The picture which shows the peasant shoes, the poem that says the
Roman fountain, does not merely show what these isolated beings as such
are - if, indeed, they show anything at all. Rather, they allow unconcealment
with regard to beings as a whole to happen. b The more simply and essentially
the shoe-equipment is absorbed in its essence, the more plainly and purely
the fountain is absorbed in essence, the more immediately and engagingly
do all beings become, along with them, more in being. In this way self­
concealing being becomes illuminated. Light of this kind sets its shining
into the work. The shining that is set into the work is the beautiful.

Beauty

is one way in which truth as uTUoncealment comes to presence.
In certain respects, we have, now, certainly grasped the essence of truth
more clearly. What is at work in the work may, therefore, have become
clearer. Yet the work-being of the work that has now become visible still
tells us nothing at all about the most immediate and salient reality of the
work, its thingliness. It even seems as if, in pursuing the aU-consuming
aim of comprehending the self-subsistence of the work itself as purely as
possible, we have completely overlooked one crucial point: a work is always
a work, which is to say, something worked or produced

[em Gewirktes].

If

anything distinguishes the work as a work it is the fact that it has been
created. Since the work is created, and since creation requires a medium

out of and in which the work is created, thingliness, too, must be part of the

only be elucidated when

two points have been clarified:

(r) \Vhat is meant, here, by being-created and by creation as distinct
from making and being-made?

(2) \Vhat is the innermost essence of the work itself, from which it can
he gauged to what extent being created belongs to it, and to what
degree being-created determines the work-being of the work?
Creation, here, is always thought with reference to the work. To the
essence of the work there belongs the happening of truth. The nature of
creation we define in advance in terms of its relation to the essence of truth
as the unconcealment of beings. The belonging of being-created to the
work can only come to light through a still more primordial clarification of
the essence of truth. The question of truth and its essence returns.
If the statement that truth is at work in the work is to be something more

than a mere assertion, we must raise this question once again.
First of all, we must now ask, in

a

more essential way: to what extent

is an impulse to something like a work contained in the essence of truth?
\Vhat is the essence of truth, that it can be set into the work - even, under
certain conditions, must be set into the work - in order to have its being as
truth? The setting-of-truth-into-the-work is, however, how we defined the
essence of art. Hence, the question just posed becomes:
\Vhat is truth, that it can happen as art, or even must so happen? To what
extent is there

[gibt es] such a thing as art?
TRUTH AND ART

Art is the origin of both the artwork and the artist. An origin is the source

of the essence in which the being of a being presences. \Vhat is art? We
seek to discover its essential nature in the actual work. The reality of the
work was defined in terms of what is at work in the work, in terms, that is,
of the happening of truth. This happening we think of as the contesting of
the strife between world and earth.

[insichruhen)

In the intense agitation of this conflict

[Rube] . It is here that the self-subsistence, the resting-in­
of the work finds its ground:

In the work, the happening of truth is at work. But what is thus at work is

at work in the work. This means that the actual work is already presupposed,

33

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

here, as the bearer of this happening. Straight away we confront again the
question concerning the thingliness of the work before us. One thing thus
finally becomes clear: however diligently we inquire into the self-subsistence
of the work, we will fai l to discover its actual reality as long as we fail to
understand that the work is to be taken as something worked. 'lo take it
thus rests on what is closest at hand; for in the word "work
hear "worked

[Werk]"

we

[Gewirkte]." The worldy character of the work consists in its

being created by the artist. It may appear strange that this most obvious and
all-clarifying detennination of the work is mentioned for the first time only
now.
The work's createdness, however, can obviously be grasped only in tenns
of the process of creation. Hence, we are constrained by the facts to agree
to investigate the activity of the artist in order to discover the origin of the
artwork. The project of detennining the work-beinlf of the work purely
from the work itself proves to be incapable of completion.
'lurning away now from the work to investigate instead the nature of the
creative process, it will be as well, nonetheless, to keep in mind what was
said initially about the peasant shoes and the Greek temple.
We think of creation as a bringing forth. But the making of equipment,
too, is a bringing forth. Admittedly, handicraft
turn of phrase - creates no work

[Handwe1·k]

-

a significant

[ Werk], even when we contrast the hand­

made with the factory product. But what is it that distinguishes bringing
forth as creation from bringing forth in the mode of making? It is as easy
to make a verbal distinction between the creation of works and the making
of equipment as it is difficult to track down the essential traits of the two
mode.'i of bringing forth. Going by first appearances, we find the same kind
of behaviour in the activity of the potter, the sculptor, the carpenter, and
the painter. The creation of works requires the activity of handicraft. Great
artists prize craftsmanly ability above all else. Before everything else they
demand its careful cultivation based on complete command. More than any­
one else they are at pains constantly to renew their grounding in a thorough
craftsmanship. It has often enough been pointed out that the Greek.'i (who
understood a thing or two about works of art) used the same word, TEXVT'I,
for both handicraft and art, and used the same term, TexviTT\S, to refer to
both the craftsman and the artist.
It seems advisable, therefore, to determine the nature of creation in terms
of its aspect as craft. The reference, however, to the linguistic usage of the

•

Reclam edition, 196o. \Vhat does "work-being" mean? Ambiguous.

34

THE O R I G I N OF THE WOR K OF ART

Greeks - which indicates their experience of the facts - must give pause
for thought. Thus, however usual and plausible the reference to the Greek
practice of using the same word,TEXVTJ, to designate both craft and art may
be, it remains, nonetheless, off-target and superficial; for TEXVfl means nei­
ther craft nor art, and absolutely not the technical in the modem sense. It
never means any kind of practical accomplishment.
Rather, TEXVfl designates a way of knowing. "Knowing" means: having
seen, in the broad sense of seeing which means the apprehension of some­
thing present as something present. For Greek thought, the essence of
knowing is based on

ciAi)6eta, on, that is, the unconcealment of beings.

Unconcealment supports and guides all comportment toward beings. A.�
knowledge experienced in the Greek manner, TEXVTJ is a bringing forth of
beings in that it brings forth what is present, as such,

out of concealment,

specifically into the unconcealment of their appearance. TExVfl never desig­
nates the activity of making.
The artist is not a TEXViTfiS because he is also a craftsman but rather
because both the setting-forth

[Her-stellen) of works and the setting-forth of

equipment happen in that bringing forth which allows beings, by assuming
an appearance, to come forth into their presence. All this happens, however,
in the midst of beings which arise of their own accord, in the midst of <flvcrts.
The designation of art as TEXVfl docs not at all mean that the activity of the
artist can be discovered via handicraft. \Vhat looks like craft in the creation
of the work is a different kind of thing. Such activity is detemtined and
pervaded by the essential nature of creation, and remains, as well, contained
within it.
If not handicraft, what is to guide our thinking about the essential nature
of creation? I low could it be anything other than having in view the to-be­
created, the work? Though the work first becomes an actual thing through
the completion of creative activity and is, therefore, dependent on such
activity for its reality, the essence of creation is determined by the essence
of the work. And now it can no longer seem strange that, first of all and
for a long time, we spoke only about the work and brought its createdness
into view only at the end. If its being-created is as essential to the work
as the word "work" makes it sound, then we must try to understand still
more essentially what up to now has been identified as the work-being of
the work.
In the light of the delineation of the essence of the work we have reached,
according to which the happening of truth is at work in the work, we can
characterize creation as the allowing of something to come forth in what has

35

OFF THE BEATE:\1 TRACK

been brought forth. The work's becoming a work is a mode of the becoming
and happening of truth. Everything depends on the essence of truth. What,
however, is truth for it to be the case that it has to happen in something
like a creation? To what extent docs truth, on the basis of its essence, have
an impulse towards the work? Can we understand this from the essence of
truth as it has been clarified to date?
Truth is un-truth in that there belongs to it the originating region

(1/erktmftsbereich]

of the not-yet- (the un-)disclosed in the sense of con­

cealment. In un-concealment as truth is present, too, the other "un-" of the
twofold refusal. "I ruth as such is present in the opposition between clearing
and the twofold concealment. Truth is the ur-strife in which, always in some
particular way, the open is won; that open within which everything stands
and out of which everything withholds itself- everything which, as a being,
both shows and withdraws itself. Whenever and however the strife breaks
out and happens, it is through it that the contesting parties, clearing and
concealing, separate from one another.

In this way the open of the field of

combat is won. The openness of this open, i.e., truth, can only be what it
is, namely

this open, when and as long as it establishes itself in its open. In

this open, therefore, there must be a being in which the openness takes its
stand and achieves constancy.

In taking possession of the open, the open­

ness holds it open and supports it. Setting and taking possession

(Setzen

und Besetzen] are here always thought in the sense of the Greek 6ea1s, which
means a setting up in the unconcealed.
With reference to the self-establishment of openness in the open,3 our
thinking touches on an area which cannot here be elucidated. Only this
should be noted; that if, in some manner, the essence of unconcealment
belongs to being itself (compare Being and Time, section 44), then it is being
which, in virtue of its essence, allows the freeplay of openness (the clearing
of the "there'') to happen, and introduces it as a place ofthe sort in which, in
its own manner, each being arises.
Truth happens only by establishing itself in the strife and space it itself
opens up. Since truth is the opposition of clearing and concealment, there
belongs to it what may here be called "establishment." But truth is not
present in itself beforehand, somewhere among the stars, so as then, later
on, to find accommodation among beings. This is impossible since it is the
openness of beings which first affords the possibility of a somewhere and

THE ORIGI� OF THE WORK OF ART

a place filled by the things that presence. Clearing of the openness and
establishment in the open belong together. They arc the same thing, an
essence of the happening of truth. This happening is, in many different
ways, historical.
One essential way in which truth establishes itself in the beings it has
opened up is its setting-itself-into-the-work. Another way in which truth
comes to presence is through the act which founds a state. Again, another
way in which truth comes to shine is the proximity of that which is not
simply a being but rather the being which is most in being. Yet another
way in which truth grounds itself is the essential sacrifice. A still further
way in which truth comes to be is in the thinker's questioning, which, as the
thinking ofbeing, names being in its question-worthiness [Frag-wiirdigkeit].
Science, by contrast, is not an original happening of truth but always the
cultivation of a domain of truth that has already been opened. It does this
through the apprehension and confirmation of that which shows itself to
be possible and necessarily correct within this sphere. If, and to the extent
that, a science transcends correctness and arrives at a truth - i.e., an essential
disclosure of beings as such - it is philosophy.
Since it belongs to the essence of truth to establish itself within beings
in order first to become truth, an

impulse to tbe work belongs to the essence

of truth as one of truth's distinctive possibilities for achieving being in the
midst of beings.
The establishment of truth in the work is the bringing forth of a being
of a kind which never was before and never wiU be again. The bringing
forth places this being in the open in such a way that what is to be brought
forth first clears the openness of the open into which it comes forth. When
this bringing forth brings with it specifically the openness of beings, that
is, truth, that which is brought forth, is a work. Bringing forth of this kind
is creation. As such a bringing it is, better expressed, a receiving and taking
over that occurs within the pull

[Bezug]

toward unconcealment. In what,

then, does createdness consist? It may be elucidated through two essential
determinations.
Truth establishes itself in the work. Truth is present only as the strife
between clearing and concealing in the opposition between world and earth.
As this strife of world and earth, truth wills its establishment in the work.

The strife is not resolved in something brought forth specifically for that
purpose, but neither is it merely housed there. The strife is, rather, opened
up by the work. This being must, therefore, contain within itselfthe essential
traits of the strife.

In

the strife the unity of world and earth is won. As a

37

OFF

THE BEATE� TRACK

world opens itsel f up, it puts up for decision, by a historical humanity, the
question of victory or defeat, blessing and curse, lordship and slavery. The
dawning world brings to the fore that which is still undecided and without
measure and decisiveness.
As a world opens itself up, however, the earth rises up. It shows itself as
that which bears all, as that which is secure in its law and which constantly
closes itself up. World demands its decisiveness and measure and allows
beinbTS to attain to the openness of its paths. Earth, bearing and rising up,
strives to preserve its closedness and to entrust everything to its law. The
strife is not rift [Riss] , in the sense of a tearing open of a mere cleft; rather, it
is the intimacy of the mutual dependence of the contestants. The rift L-arries
the contestants into the source of their unity, their common ground. It is
the fundamental design [Gnmd1irs]. It is the outline sketch [Arif:.7.iss] that
marks out the fundantental features ofthe rising up ofthe clearing of beings.
Tlt.is design [Riss] does not allow the contestant'i to break apart. It brings
the contest between measure and limit into a shared outline [ Umros].
Truth establishes itself as strife in a being that is to be brought forth
only in such a way that the strife opens up in tlt.is being; the being itself,
in other words, is brought into the rift-design [Riss] . The rift-design is the
drawing together into a unity of sketch and fundamental design rupture and
outline. Truth establishes itself in a being in such a way, indeed, that tlt.is
being itself occupies the open of truth. This occupying, however, can only
happen in such a way that what is to be brought forth, the rift, entrusts itself
to the self-closing that rises up in the open. The rift must set itself back into
the pull of the weight of the stone, into the dumb hardness of the wood,
into the dark glow of the colors. As the earth takes the rift back into itself,
the rift is for the first time set forth into the open and therefore placed,
i.e., set, into that which rises up in the open as the self-closing and as the
protecting.
This strife which is brought into the rift-design, and so set back into the
earth and fixed in place, is thejigtm [Gestalt]. The createdness of the work
means: the fixing in place of truth in the figure. Figure is the structure of
the rift in its self-establishment. The structured rift is the jointure [Fuge] of
the shining of truth. What we here call "figure" is always to be thought out
of that particular placing [stellen] and placement [ Ge-stellj as which the work
comes to presence when it sets itself up and sets itself forth.
In the creation of the work, the strife, as rift, must be set back into the
earth; the earth itself must be set forth and made use of as the self-closing.
This making use of, however, does not use up and misuse the earth as mere

Ti l E ORIGI:'I/ OF THE WORK O F ART

matter; rather, i t frees it to be, for the first time, itself. Such using of the
earth is a working with it that indeed looks like the employment of matter in
handicraft. This is what created the appearance that the creation of a work
is also craft activity. It never is. But it remains always a using of earth in the
fixing in place of truth in the figure. By contrast, the making of equipment
is never, in the first instance, an effecting of the happening of truth. The
production of equipment is finished when the material has been so formed
as to be ready for use. The equipment's readiness for usc means that it is
released beyond itself to disappear into usefulness.
Not so the createdness of the work. This will become clear through a
consideration of the second characteristic, which may be introduced at this
point.
The readiness of equipment and the createdness of the work have i n
common that each i s something that has been brought forth. But what makes
the createdness of the work different from every other bringing forth is that
it is also created into the created work. But is this not true of everything that
has been brought forth or in any other way has come into being? Everything
that is brought forth, if endowed with anything at all, is endowed, surely,
with its having-been-brought-forth. Certainly. But in the work createdness
is expressly created into what is created, with the result that it expressly
rises up out of the work. If this is how things are, then it must be possible
to experience createdness in the work itself.
That createdness stands forth out of the work does not mean that it
should be a salient feature of the work that it is made by a great artist. The
point is not that the created work be certified as a product of ability so as
thereby to raise the public profile of the producer. \Vhat is announced is
not

"N.N. fecit."

Rather, "factum

est"

is what is to be held forth into the

open by the work: in other words this, that an unconcealment of beings
has happened here and, as this happening, happens here for the first time;
or this, that this work

is rather

than is not. The thrust that the work, as

this work, is and the unceasingness of this inconspicuous thrust constitute
the constancy of the self-subsistence of the work. Precisely where the artist
and the process and circumstances of the work's coming into being remain
unknown, this thrust, this "that [doss] " of createdness, steps into view at its
purest from out of the work.
Tc> be sure, "that" it is made also belongs to every piece of equipment

that is available for, and in, use. This "that,'! however, is not salient in the
equipment; it disappears into usefulness. The handier a piece of equipment,
the more inconspicuous is the fact that, for example, a hammer of a certain

39

OFF Ti l E BEATEl': TRACK

kind is, that is, exists; the handier a piece of equipment, the more completely
it preserves itself in its equipmentality. We arc capable, in general, of notic­
ing of anything present that such a thing is; but as soon as this is noted it
falls, just as quickly, into the oblivion of the commonplace. \¥hat, however,
is more commonplace than that a being is? In the work, on the other hand,
the fact that it

is as such

a thing, is what is unusual. The happening of its

createdness does not simply reverberate through the work; rather, the work
casts before itself the eventful fact that, as a work, this work is, and exhibits
this fact constantly. The more essentially the work opens itself, the more
luminous becomes the uniqueness of the fact that it is rather than is not.
The more essentially this thrust comes into the open, the stranger and more
solitary the work becomes. In the bringing forth of the work there lies the
offering forth of the "that it is."
The question ofthe created ness ofthe work should have brought us closer
to the work-character of the work and thereby to it.'i reality. Createdness
has revealed itself to be the strife's being fixed in place through the rift in
the figure. By this means, createdness itself is specifically created into the
work and stands as the silent thrust into the open of the "that." But even
createdness fails to exhaust the reality of the work. However, this view of
the essence of the createdness of the work puts us into a position to take the
step to which everything that has been said up to now leads.
The more solitary the work, fixed in the figure, stands within itself, the
more purely it seems to sever all ties to human beings, then the more simply
does the thrust that such a work is step into the open, and the more essentially
the extraordinary is thrust to the surface and the long-familiar thrust down.
Yet there is nothing violent about this multidirectional thrust, for the more
purely is the work itself transported into the openness ofbeings it itselfopens
up, then the more simply does it carry us into this openness and, at the same
time, out of the realm of the usual. To submit to this displacement means:
to transform all familiar relations to world and to earth, and henceforth
to restrain all usual doing and prizing, knowing and looking, in order to
dwell within the truth that is happening in the work. The restraint of this
dwelling allows what is created to become, for the first time, the work that
it is. This allowing the work to be a work is what we call its preservation. It
is in such preservation that, in its createdness, the work first gives itself as
the real which now means, is present in its work-character.
Just as a work cannot be without being created, just as it stands in es­
sential need of creators, so what is created cannot come into being without
preservers.

THE O R I G I N OF

TilE

WO R K OF ART

If, however, a work does not - or does not immediately - find preservers
who respond to the truth happening in the work, that does not mean that
a work can be a work without preservers. If it is in other respects a work, it
always remains tied to preservers even, and precisely, when it only waits for
preservers and only solicits and awaits their entry into its truth. Even the
oblivion into which the work can fall is not nothing: it is still a preserving. It
lives off the work. Preservation of the work means: standing within the open­
ness of beings that happens in the work. This urgent standing-withinness

[lnstiindigkeit] of preservation is, however, a knowing. Yet knowing does not
consist in mere acquaintance with and ideas about something. Whoever
truly knows what is knows what he wills in the midst of what is.
The willing referred to here, which neither merely applies knowledge
nor decides in advance of it, is thought out of the foundational experience
of the thinking of Being and

Time. The knowing that is a willing, and the
willing that is a knowing, is the existing [e.tirtierendm] human being's allow­
ing himself ecstatic [ekstntische] entrance into the unconcealment of beings.
The resoluteness.. which is thought in Being and Time is not the decisive
action of a subject, but rather the human being's [Dasein.r] opening up from
out of its captivity by beings into the openness of being. In his existence,
however, man does not move from something inward to something outer.
Rather, the essence of existence is the out-standing standing-within the es­
sential separation belonging to the clearing of beings. Neither the creating
discussed earlier nor the willing that is our current topic is thought of as the
achievement or action of a subject who sets himself a goal that he strives to
achieve.
Willing is the sober resoluteness

[Ent-schlossmheit] of that existential [ex­

istif:rmden] self-transcendence which exposes itself to the openness of beings
as it is set into the work.

In this way, the urgent standing-within is brought

into law. As knowing, preservation of the work is the sober standing-within
the awesomeness of the truth that happens in the work.
This knowing which, as willing, makes its home in the truth of the work ­
and only thus remains a knowing - does not take the work out of its self­
subsistence, does not drag it into the sphere of mere experience

[Erlebens]

and does not degrade it to the role of a mere stimulant to experience. Preser­
vation of the work does not individualize human beings down to their expe­
riences but rather, brings them into a belonging to the truth that happens in

[Miteinnnder­
sein] as the historical standing out of human existence [Da-seins] from out of
the work. By so doing it founds their being-with-one-another

the relation to unconcealment. Most particularly, knowing in the mode of

OFF THE B EATE:-.: TRACK

preservation is far removed from that merely cultivated connoisseurship of
the formal features of the work, its qualities and intrinsic charms. Knowing
as having seen is a being-decided; it is a standing-within the strife that the
work has fixed into the design [Riss] .
The manner of the proper preservation of the work is created and prefig­
ured for us only and exclusively by the work itself. Preservation happens at
different levels of knowledge, always with differing degrees of scope, con­
stancy, and lucidity. If works are presented to be enjoyed merely as art, it is
not yet established that they stand in preservation as works.
As soon as the thrust into the extra-ordinary

[Un-gehem·e] is captured by

familiarity and connoisseurship, the art business has already begun to take
over the works. Even the careful handing down of works to posterity and
the scientific attempt to recover them no longer reach to their work-being
itself, but only to a memory of it. But even this can still offer a place to the
work from out of which it can contribute to the shaping of history. The
ownm ost reality of the work, however, comes to bear only where the work
is preserved in the truth that happens through it itself.
The reality of the work is determined, in its fundamental features, from
out of the essence of its work-being. We are now in a position to return
to our opening question: how do matters stand with that thingliness of the
work which guarantees the work's immediate reality? They stand in such a
way that we no longer ask the question about the work's thingliness. For as
long as we pose that question we take it as a foregone conclusion that the
work is present to us as an object. In this way, our questioning proceeds not
from the work, but from ourselves. From ourselves - we who do not allow
the work to be a work but represent it, rather, as an object that is supposed
to bring about certain conditions within us.
That element within the work, however, which looks like its thingliness
when the work is taken as an object (according to the usual concepts of the
thing), experienced from out of the work, is its character as earth. Earth rises
up within the work because the work is present as something in which truth
is at work, and because truth only presences where it establishes itself in a
being. In the earth, however, as the essentially self-closing, the openness of
the open encounters the highest form of resistance and through this finds
the site of its steady stand in which the figure must be fixed in place.
Was it, then, superfluous to go into the question of the thingliness of the
thing? By no means. It is true that the work's thingliness cannot be defined
in tenns of its work-character, but, on the other hand, knowing the work­
character of the work can point the question of the thingliness of the thing

THE ORIGI:"J OF THF. WORK OF ART

in the right direction. This is no mean achievement, when we recollect that
those modes of thinking familiar from ancient times arc an attack upon the
thingliness of the thing, and all the more when we recollect that they submit
beings as a whole to an interpretation which is incapable of grasping the
essence of equipment and of work, and makes us blind to the primordial
essence of truth.
lh detennine the thingliness of the thing, neither reference to the hearer

of properties nor to the unity of the manifold of the sensorily given is
adequate. Least adequate of all is the matter-form structure, taken by itself,
which is taken from the realm of equipment. 'lo provide an authoritative
and deep interpretation of the thingliness of the thing we must tum to
the belonging of the thing to earth. The essential nature of earth, of the
unmasterahle and self-closing bearer, reveals itself, however, only in its
rising up into a world, in the opposition between world and earth. This strife
is fixed in place within the work's figure and become.o; manifest through this
figure. What is true of equipment, that we experience its equipmentality
proper only through the work is true, also, of the thingliness of the thing.
That we never know of the thingliness of the thing directly, and if we know
it at all do so only in an indefinite kind of way - in other words, that we need
the work - this fact shows indirectly that in the work-being of the work the
happening of truth, the disclosure of beings, is at work.
But, we might finally object, if the work is indeed to bring thingliness
into the open in a striking way, must not the work, for its part - before, and
for the sake of its createdness - have been brought into relation to the things
of the earth, to nature? Someone who must have known about it, Albrecht
Diirer, made, after all, the well-known remark: "For in truth, art is found
in nature; whoever can wrest it from her has it." "Wrest
here, to bring forth the rift

[Rirs]

and to seize

[7·eiflen)

[reiflen]"

means

it with drawing pen

and drawing board. Immediately, however, we raise the counter-question:
how can the rift be wrested forth except as the rift, and that means if it has
not first been brought into the open, through the creative sketch, as the
strife between measure and unmeasure? Certainly, there is found in nature
a rift, measure, and limit, and bound to them the potentiality for a bringing
forth, art. But it is just as certain that this art which is in nature is made
manifest only by the work, made manifest because it is found in the work
in a primordial way.
Our efforts concerning the reality of ·the work should have prepared
the ground for discovering, in the reality of the work, art and its essential
nature. The question of the nature of art, and of the path to knowing it,

43

OFf THE BF.ATE:'II TRACK

needs first to be placed on finn ground again. The answer to the question is
only the final result of the last step of a long sequence of questioning steps.
Each answer remains in force as an answer only as long as it is rooted in
questioning.

In the light of its work-being, the reality of the work has become not

only clearer but, at the same time, essentially richer. "lo the createdness of
the work the preservers belong just as essentially as the creators. But it is
the work which make.o; the creators possible in their essence and which, in
virtue of its essence, needs the preservers. If art is the origin of the work this
means that it lets originate, in its essence, the essential belonging together
at work of creator and preserver. What, however, is art itself that justifies
us in calling it an "origin"?

In the work, the happening of truth is at work; at work, indeed, in the

manner of a work. Accordingly, the essential nature of art was specified, in
advance, as the setting-itself-to-work of truth. But this definition is inten­
tionally ambiguous. On the one hand, it says: art is the fixing in place of
self-establishing truth in the figure. This happens in creation, understood
as the bringing forth of the unconcealment of beings. At the same time,
however, setting-to-work also means: bringing the work-character of the
work into motion and happening. This happens as preservation. Thus art is:
the creative preservation of the truth in the work. Att is,

of the unconcealedness of beings which is set into the work and casts itself
toward us, everything ordinary and hitherto existing becomes an unhe­
ing. This unbeing has lost the capacity to give and to preserve being as
measure. What is curious here is that the work in no way affects hitherto
existing beings through causal connection. The effecting [ Wb·k ung] of the
work does not consist in a taking effect

[wirken]. It lies in a transformation

of the unconcealment of beings which happens from out of the work, a
transformation, that is to say, of being.a
Poetry, however, is no aimless imagining of whimsicalities, and no flight
of mere representations and fancies into the unreal. What poetry, as clearing
projection, unfolds of unconcealment and projects into the rift within the
figure is the open; poetry allows this open to happen in such a way, indeed,
that now, for the first time, in the midst of beings, it brings them to shine
and sound. If we fix our ga7.e on the essence of the work and its relation to
the happening of the truth of beings, it becomes questionable whether the
essence of poetry, of that is to say, projection, can be adequately thought in
terms of imagination and the power of imagining.
It may here be emphasized that the essence of poetry, of which we have
now learned in its full breadth (but not, on that account, in a vague kind of
way) is something worthy of questioning, is something that remains to be
thought through. h
If the essence of all art is poetry, then architecture, the visual arts, and
music must all be referred back to poesy. That is completely arbitrary. Cer­
tainly it is, if we mean that these arts are branches of the art oflanguage - if
we may be allowed to designate poesy with a title easily capable of misunder­
standing. But poesy is only a mode of the illwninating projection of truth,
of, that is to say, poeticizing in this broader sense. Nonetheless, the linguis­
tic work, poetry in the narrower sense, has a privileged position among the
arts as a whole.
To see this all we need is the right concept of language. According to the
usual account, language is a kind of communication. It serves as a means
of discussion and agreement, in general for achieving understanding. But
language is neither merely nor primarily the aural and written expression
of what needs to be communicated. The conveying of overt and covert

meanings is not what language, in the first instance, does. Rather, it brings
beings as beings, for the first time, into the open. \Vhere language is not
present, as in the being ofstones, plants, or animals, there is also no openness
of beings, and consequently no openness either of that which is not a being

[des Nichtseienden) or of emptiness.
Language, by naming beings for the first time, first brings beings to
word and to appearance. This naming nominates beings to their being and
from

out of that being.

Such saying is a projection of the clearing in which

announcement is made as to what beings will come into the open as. Project­
ing

[Entwnfen]• is the releasing of a throw [Wt11j] as which unconcealment

sends itself into heings as such. This projective announcement immediately
becomes a renunciation of all dim confusion within which beings veil and
withdraw themselves. �>
Projective saying is poetry: the saying of world and earth, the saying of
the arena of their strife and, thereby, of all nearness and distance of the
gods. Poetry is the saying of the unconcealment of beings. The prevailing
language is the happening of that saying in which its world rises up histor­
ically for a people and the earth is preserved as that which remains closed.
Projective saying is that in which the preparation of the sayable at the same
time brings the unsayable as such to the world. In such saying, the concepts
of its essence - its belonging to world-history, in other words - are formed,
in advance, for a historical people.
Poetry is here thought in such a broad sense, and at the same time in
such an intimate and essential unity with language and the word, that it
must remain open whether art, in all its modes from architecture to poesy,
exhausts the nature of poetry.
Language itself is poetry in the essential sense. But since language is that
happening in which, each time, beings are first disclosed as beings, poesy,
poetry in the narrower sense, is the most primordial form of poetry in the
essential sense. Language is not poetry because it is ur-poesy; rather, poesy
happens in language because the latter preserves the primordial essence of
poetry. Building and plastic creation, on the other hand, happen, always
and only, in the open of saying and naming. It is this open which perme­
ates and guides them. For this reason, they remain their own particular
ways and manners in which truth orders itself into the work. They are an

always unique poeticizing within the clearing of beings which has already
happened, unnoticed, in the language. a
As the setting-into-work of truth, art is poetry. It is not only the creation

of the work that is poetic; equally poetic, though in its own way, is the preser­
vation of the work. For a work only actually is as a work when we transport
ourselves out of the habitual and into what is opened up by the work so as
to bring our essence itself to take a stand within the truth of beings.b
'I be essence of art is poetry. The essence of poetry, however, is the found­
ing [Stifttmg] of truth. "Founding" is understood, here, in a threefold sense:
as bestowing, as grounding, and as beginning. But it only becomes actual
in preserving. Thus to each mode of founding there corresponds a mode
of preserving. All we can do at present is to make this essential structure
visible in a few strokes, and even that only to the extent that the earlier
characterization of the essential nature of the work provides an initial clue.

never be verified or derived

from what went before. In its exclusive reality, what went before is refuted
by the work. What art founds, therefore, can never be compensated and
made good in terms of what is present and available for use. The founding
is an overflowing, a bestowal.
The poeticizing projection of truth, which sets itself into the work as
figure, is never carried out in the direction of emptiness and indeterminacy.

In

the work, rather, truth is cast toward the coming preservers, that is to

say, a historical hwnanity. What is cast forth, however, is never an arbitrary
demand. The truly poeticizing projection is the opening up of that in which
human existence

[Dasein], as historical, is already thrown [ge·w01jen]. This is

the earth (and, for a historical people, its earth), the self-closing ground on
which it rests, along with everything which - though hidden from itself- it
already is. It is, however, its world which prevails from out of the relationship
of existence to the unconcealment ofheing. For this reason, everything with
which man is endowed must, in the projection, be fetched forth from out
of the closed ground and explicitly set upon this ground. In this way, the
ground is first founded as a ground that bears.

Because it is such a fetching-forth, all creation is a fetching, as in fetching
water from a spring. Modern subjectivism, of course, misinterprets creation
as the product of the genius of the self-sovereign subject. The founding of
truth is a founding, not merely in the sense of a free bestowal, but in the
sense, too, of this ground-laying grounding. The poeticizing projection
comes out of nothing in the sense that it never derives its gift from what is
familiar and already here. In another sense, however, it does not come out
of nothing; for what it projects is but the withheld determination of man's
historical existence itself.
Bestowal and grounding have in themselves the abruptness of what we
call a beginning. But this suddenness of the beginning, the uniqueness of
what is unique to the leap• from out of this suddenness, docs not exclude rather it includes - the fact that the beginning has inconspicuously prepared
itself over the longest time. As a leap, the genuine beginning is always a
leaping-ahead, a leaping-ahead in which everything to come is already leapt
over, even if as something veiled. Concealed within ito;clf, the beginningh
contains already the end. A genuine beginning, of course, is not a beginning
in the sense ofbeing primitive. The primitive, because it lacks the bestowing,
grounding leap and the leap-ahead, has no future. lt cannot release anything
more from itself since it contains nothing save that in which it is caught.
A beginning, by contrast, always contains the undisclosed fullness of the
extraordinary, and that means the strife with the ordinary. Art as poetry
is founding in the third sense of the instigation of the strife of truth; it
is founding as beginning. Whenever what is as a whole, as what is, itself
demands a grounding in openness, then art, as founding, accedes to its
historical essence. In the West, this first happened in Greece. What would,
in the future, be called being was set into the work in a standard-setting way.
The thus-opened totality of beings was then transformed into beings in the
sense of God's creation. This happened in the Middle Ages. This kind of
being was again transformed at the beginning, and during the course, of the
modem age. Beings became transparent objects capable of being mastered
by calcuJation. Each time, the openness of beings had to be established in
beings themselves, through the fixing in place of truth in the figure. Each
time, the unconcealment of beings happened. It set itself into the work, a
setting which is accomplished by art.

Whenever art happens, whenever, that is, there is a beginning, a thrust
enters history and history either begins or resumes. History, here, does not
mean a sequence of event.'> in time, no matter how important. History is the
transporting of a people into its appointed task [Alifgegebenes] as the entry
into its endowment [Mitgegebmes].
Art is the setting-itself-to-work of truth. An essential ambiguity is con­
cealed in this sentence, present because "truth" functions as both subject
and object. Yet "subject" and "object" are inappropriate terms, here. They
prevent our thinking this ambiguous essence - a task that no longer belongs
to our reflections. Art is historical and, as historical, is the creative preser­
vation of truth in the work. Art happens as poetry. This is founding in the
threefold sense of bestowing, grounding, and beginning. As founding, art is
essentially historical. This does not just mean that art has a history, a history
in the external sense that, in the passage of time, art appears together with
many other things, and in the process changes and passes away, and offers
changing aspects to the study of history. Art is history in the essential sense:
it is the ground of history.
Art allows truth to arise [mt.pringm]. Art arises as the founding preser­
vation of the truth of beings in the work. To allow something to arise, to
bring something into being from out of the essential source in the founding
leap [Spnmg] is what is meant by the word "origin [Unprung]."
The origin of the artwork - of, that is, creators and preservers, which is
to say, the historical existence of a people - is art. This is so because, in its
essence, art is an origin: a distinctive way in which truth comes into being,
becomes, that is, historical.
We arc inquiring into the essential nature ofart. Why do we thus inquire?
We do so in order to be able to ask properly whether or not, in our historical
existence, art is an origin, whether, and under what conditions, it can and
must become one.
Such reflections cannot compel art and its coming-to-be. But this reflec­
tive knowledge is the preliminary and therefore indispensable preparation
for the coming-to-be of art. Only such knowledge prepares, for art, the
space," for creators, the path, and for preservers the location.
In such knowledge, which can only grow slowly, it is decided whether
art can be an origin - and therefore mlL'it be a leap ahead - or whether it
should remain a mere postscript, in which case it can only be carried along
as a cultural phenomenon that has become routine.

Are we, in our existence, historically at the origin? Or do we, rather, in
our relationship with art, appeal, merely, to a cultured knowledge of the
past?
For this either-or and its decision there is a certain sign. Holderlin, the
poet whose work still stands before the Germans as a test, put it into words
when he said:

Reluctant to leave the place

Al-TERWORD
The foregoing considerations are concerned with the enigma

[Riitset] of art,

the enigma that art itself is. They are far from claiming to solve the enigma.
The task is to see the enigma.
Almost as soon as specialized thinking about art and the artist began, such
reflections were referred to as "aesthetic." Aesthetics treated the artwork
as an object, as indeed an object of

aia6T)a•s, of sensory apprehension in

a broad sense. These days, such apprehension is called an "experience."
The way in which man experiences art is supposed to infortn us about its
essential nature. Experience is the standard-giving source not only for the
appreciation and enjoyment of art but also for its creation.3 Everything is
experience. But perhaps experience is the element in which art dies.h This
dying proceeds so slowly that it takes several centuries.
One speaks, of course, of the immortal works of art and of art as an eternal
value. One speaks this language which, in all essential matters, deals with
nothing precisely because one fears that dealing with things precisely calls, in
the end, for - thinking. What fear is today greater than the fear of thinking?

T i l F. ORlGl� OF T H E WOR K OF ART

Does this talk of the immortal works and eternal values of art have any
content or substance? Or arc these merely the half-thought cliches of an age
in which great art, together with its essence, has departed from among men?
The most comprehensive reflections on the nature of art possessed by
the West - comprehensive because thought out of metaphysics - are Hegel's
Lecttn·es on Aesthetics. Here one finds the following statements:
Art no longer counts as the highest way in which truth finds existence for itself. •

(Wrrke, vol. X, I, p. 1 34)

One may well hope that art will continue to advance and perfect itself, but its form
has ceased to be the highest need of spirit.
(ibid., p. I J5)
In all these connections art is, and remains, with regard to its highest vocation, a
thing of the past.
(ibid. ' p. 16)

The judgment made in these sentences cannot be evaded by pointing
out that since the last time Hegel lectured on his aesthetics, the winter of
1 82 8"""9, we have seen the advent of many new artworks and art movements.
This possibility was one Hegel never wanted to deny. Yet the question
remains: is art still an essential and necessary way in which that truth happens
which is decisive for our historical existence, or is this something that art
no longer is? But if art is that no longer, the question remains as to why
this is so. A decision concerning Hegel's judgment has not yet been made;
for behind the judgment there stands Western thinking since the Greeks, a
thinking which corresponds to a truth of beings that has already happened.
The decision about the judgment will be made, when it is made, from
and about this truth of beings. Until then, the judgment remains in force
[in Gelttmg]. But for this very reason we need to ask whether the truth it
expresses is final and conclusive, and what then follows if it is.
Questions such as these which touch us, sometimes quite clearly, some­
times only in a vague kind of way, can only be asked if we give thought to
the essence of art. We attempt to take a few steps in this direction by posing
the question of the origin of the work of art. What is needed is to bring into
view the work-character of the work. What we mean, here, by the word
"origin" is thought out of the essence of truth.
The truth of which we have spoken does not coincide with what is gen­
erally recognized under this name - that which is assigned to knowledge

unconcealment of beings as beings.a Truth is the truth of beings. Beauty
does not occur alongside this truth. It appears when truth sets ito;elf into the

Reality becomes objectivity. Objectivity becomes experience. ln the manner
in which, for the world determined in the Western way, beings exist as the

the transformation of the essence of truth there corresponds the essential

On pages 38 and 44, the attentive reader will be forced to take note of a real
difficulty: it looks as though the remarks about the "fixing in place of truth"
and about the "letting happen of the advent of truth" can never be made
consistent with each other. For in "fixing in place

[Fest.rtellenJ" there is im­
plied a willing which blocks and prevents truth's advent. In "letti11g happen,"

on the other hand, what is presented is a submitting - and, therefore, so to
speak, a not-willing - as that which clears a space for the advent of truth.
The difficulty is resolved if we think "fixing in place" in the sense in
which it is intended throughout the entire text of the essay, above all, in the
key specification "setti11g-to-work." b Together with "to place (stellen)" and
"to set" belongs "to lay"; all three meanings are contained as a unity within

T l J E O R ! G i l': OF THE WORK OF ART

"To place" must be thought in the sense of 6ea1s. So one reads on p. 36:
"Setting and taking possession [Setzen muJ Besetzm] are here always (!)
thought in the sense of the Greek 6ea1s, which means a setting up in the
unconcealed." The Greek "setting" means: placing as allowing to arise, for
example, a statue. It means: laying, laying down a sacred offering. "Placing"
and "laying" have the sense of bringing hither3 into unconcealment, bring­
ingforth among what is present, that is, allowing to lie forth. "Setting" and
"placing" here never mean the swnmoning of things to be placed over and
against the self (the "I" as subject) as conceived in the modem fashion. The
standing of the statue (i.e., the presence of the radiance that faces us) is dif­
ferent from the standing of what stands over and against us [ Gegmstandj in
the sense of an object [O�ekt] . "Standing" (cf. p. 1 6 above) is the constancy
of the radiance. In the dialectic of Kantian and Gem1an idealism, on the
other hand, thesis, antithesis, and synthesis refer to a placing within the
sphere of the subjectivity of consciousness. Accordingly, Hegel - correctly
in terms of his own position - interpreted the Greek 6ea1s as the immediate
positing [Setzen] of the object. This positing is for him, therefore, untrue
since it is not yet mediated by antithesis and thesis (compare "Hegel and
the Greeks" in Patbmarks').
But if, in the context of the artwork-essay, we keep in mind the Greek
sense of 6ea1s - to let lie forth in its radiance and presence - then the "fixed"
corresponding to "fix in place" can never mean the stiff, motionless, and
secure.
"Fixed" means: outlined, admitted into the boundary (Tiepas), brought
into the outline (compare pp. 3 8ff. above). The boundary, in the Greek
sense, does not block off but, rather, as itself something brought forth, first
brings what is present to radiance. The boundary sets free into unconceal­
ment: by means of its outline, the mountain stands in the Greek light in its
towering and repose. The boundary which fixes and consolidates is what
reposes, reposes in the fullness of movement. All this is true of the work in
the sense of the Greek epyov. The work's "being" is l:vepye1a, a terrn which
gathers into itself infinitely more movement than the modem "energies."
It follows, then, that, properly thought, the "fixing in place" of truth can
never run counter to "allowing to happen." In the first place, this "allowing"
is nothing passive; rather, it is the highest forrn of action (see Vott-riige uruJ
Aufsiitze, 19 54, p. 49) in the sense of 6ems, an "effecting" and "willing"
which, in the present essay, is characterized- as "the existing hwnan being's

allowing himself ecstatic entrance into the unconcealment of beings" (p. 41
above). In the second place, the "happen" in the "letting happen of truth"
is the prevailing movement in clearing and concealment or, more precisely,
in their union; in other words, it is the movement of the clearing of self­
concealment as such, from which, in turn, all self-illumination arises. This
"movement" even requires a fixing in place in the sense of a bringing forth,
where this "bringing" is to be understood in the sense indicated on p. 3 7, in
that the creating (creative) bringing forth "(is) a receiving and taking over

tial one since it corresponds to the destiny of being.

Ge-ste/1, as the essence

of modern technology, comes from letting-lie-before experienced in the
Greek manner,

becomes making fast and fixing in place.
\Vhen we hear the words "fix in place" and

"Ge-stell"

in "The Origin

of the Artwork" we must, on the one hand, forget the modern meaning
of placing and enframing. Yet on the other, we must not overlook the fact
that, and extent to which, being as

Ge-stell, definitive of modernity, comes

forth from out of the Western destiny of being and is nothing thought up
by philosophers; rather, it is something which is thought to the thoughtful
(compare

Vom"iige und Aufsiitze, p. 28

and p. 49).

There remains the difficult task of discussing the definitions given on
pp. 36ff. for the "establishing" and "self-establishing of truth in beings."
Here again, we must avoid understanding "e.-;tablishing" in the modern
sense, avoid understanding it as "organizing" and "making ready" in the
manner of a lecture on technology. Rather, "establishing" thinks toward
the "impulse of truth toward the work" referred to on p. 37, the impulse

54

T i l E O R I G I N OF T H E WORK OF ART

that, in the midst of beings, truth itself should be as a work, should come
to be in being (p. 37 above).
If we recollect how truth as the unconcealment of beings means nothing
other than the presence of beings as such - that is, of being (see p. 45) then the talk of the self-establishment of truth (i.e., of being) in beings
touches on the questionableness [das Fmgwiirdige] of the ontological dif­
ference (compare Identity and Diffirmce, pp. 47ff.). For this reason p. 36 of
"The Origin of the Work of Art" sounds a note of caution: "With reference
to the self-establishment of openness in the open our thinking touches on
an area which cannot here be elucidated." The entire essay moves know­
ingly yet implicitly, along the path of the question of the essence of being.
Reflection on what art may be is completely and decisively directed solely
toward the question of being. Art is accorded neither an area of cultural
achievement nor an appearance of spirit; it belongs, rather, to the Event out
of which the "meaning of being" (compare Beittg and Time) is first deter­
mined. What art may be is one of the questions to which the essay offers
no answer. What may give the impre..'ision of such an answer are directions
for questioning (compare the first sentences of the Afterword).
Among these directions are two import1111t hi11ts (on p. 44 and p. 49). At
both places there is talk of "ambiguity." On p. 49 an "essential ambiguity"
is mentioned with respect to the definition of art as the "setting-to-work
of tnlth." On the one hand, "truth" is the "subject," on the other the "ob­
ject." Both characterizations remain "inappropriate." If truth is subject, then
the definition "setting-to-work of truth" means the setting-itself-to-work of
truth (compare p. 44 and p. 1 6). In this manner art is thought out of the
Event. Being, however, is a call to man and cannot be without him. Accord­
ingly, art is at the same time defined as the setting-to-work of truth, where
truth mnJ.I is "object" and art is human creating and preserving.
Within the humnn relation lies the other ambiguity in the setting-to­
work which, on p. 44, is identified as that between creation and pre..'iervation.
According to pages 44 and 3 3 , it is the artwork and artist that have a "special"
relationship to the coming into being of art. In the label "setting-to-work
of truth," in which it remains undetermined (though determinable) who or
what docs the "setting," and in what manner, lies concealed the 1·e/ntionsbip
of being to humm1 bei11!f. This relationship is inadequately thought even in
tlus presentation - a distressing difficulty that has been clear to me since
Being and 'l ime, and has since come under discussion in many presentations
(sec, finally, "On the Question of Being" and the present essay p. 36 "Only
this should be noted; that . . . ") .

The problematic issue that prevails here, then, comes to a head at the
very place in the discussion where the essence of language and of poetry is
touched upon, all this, again, only in reference to the belonging together
of being and saying.
It remains an unavoidable necessity that the reader, who naturally comes
to the essay from without, at first and for a long time thereafter, represent
and interpret the facts of the case from out of the silent domain that is
the source of what has been thought. But for the author himself there
remains the necessity to speak each time in the language that is, in each
case, appropriate to the various stations on his way.

The Age ofthe World Picture

In metaphysics, reflection on the essence of beings and a decision concern­
ing the essence of truth is accomplished. Metaphysics grounds an age in
that, through a partk'lllar interpretation of beings and through a particular
comprehension of truth, it provides that age with the ground of its essen­
tial shape. This ground comprehensively governs all decisions distinctive
of the age. Conversely, in order for there to be adequate reflection on these
phenomena

[Emheimmgen], their metaphysical ground must allow itself to

be recognized in them. Reflection is the courage to put up for question �
the truth of one's own presuppositions and the space of one's own goals

(Appendix 1 ) . •

One of the essential phenomena of modernity is its science. Of equal im­
portance is machine technology. One should not, however, misconstrue this
as the mere application of modem mathematical science to praxis. Machine
technology is itself an autonomous transformation of praxis, a transforma­
tion which first demands the employment of mathematical science. Machine
technology still remains the most visible outgrowth of the essence of mod­
em technology, an essence which is identical with the essence of modem
metaphysics.
A third, equally essential phenomenon of modernity lies in the process of
art's moving into the purview of aesthetics. This means the artwork becomes
an object of experience

{.Erlebens]

and consequently is considered to be an

expression of human life.
A fourth modem phenomenon announces itself in the fact that human ·
action is understood and practiced as culture. Culture then becomes the
realization of the highest values through the care and cultivation of man's
highest goods. It belongs to the essence of culture, as such care, that it, in
tum, takes itself into care and then becomes the politics of culture.

OFF TH F. B EATEN TRACK

A fifth phenomenon of modernity is the loss of the gods [E11tgiittmmgj .
This expression does not mean the mere elimination of the gods, crude
atheism. The loss of the gods is a twofold process. On the one hand, the
world picture Christianit'.es itself inasmuch as the ground of the world is
posited as infinite and un'--onditioned, as the absolute. On the other hand,
Christendom reinterprets its Christianity as a world view (the Christian
world view) and thus makes itself modem and up to date. The loss of the
gods is the condition of indecision about God and the gods. Christianity
is chiefly responsible for bringing it about. But loss of the gods is far from
excluding religiosity. Rather, it is on its account that the relation to the gods
is transformed into religious experience

[Erlebm]. When

this happens, the

gods have fled. The resulting void is filled by the historical and psychological
investigation of myth.
What conception of beings and what interpretation of truth lies at the
basis of these phenomena?
We confine the question to the first of the phenomena mentioned above,
natural science.
In what is the essence of modem science to be found?
What conception of beings and of truth grounds this essence? If we
can manage to come upon the metaphysical ground which provides the
foundation of science as a modem phenomenon, then it must be possible
to recognize from out of that ground the essence of modernity in general.
As we use the word science these days, it means something essentially

different from the

doctrina and scientia

of the Middle Ages, different, too,

from the Greek hnaTT'JI.ITJ . Greek science was never exact precisely because,
according to its essence, it neither could be, nor needed to be, exact. Hence,
it makes no sense at all to assert that contemporary science is more exact
than the science of antiquity. Neither can one say that Galileo's doctrine of
free-f.1lling bodies is true while Aristotle's teaching that light bodies strive
upwards is false. For the Greek understanding of the nature of body and
place and of the relation between them rests on a different interpretation of
beings. It detennines, therefore, a correspondingly different way of seeing
and questioning natural occurrences. No one would presume to say that
Shakespeare's poetry is more advanced than that of Aeschylus. It is even
more impossible to say that the contemporary understanding of beings is
more correct than that of the Greeks. If, then, we wish to grasp the essence of
contemporary science we must first free ourselves of the habit of comparing
modern with older science - from the perspective of progress - merely in
terms of degree.

sB

T i l E AGE O F THE WOR L D PICTURE

The essence of what is today called science is research. In what does the
essence of re.'iearch consist?
It consists in the fact that knowing establishes itself as a procedure within·
some realm of beings in nature or history. Procedure, here, does not just
mean methodology, how things are done. For every procedure requires, in
advance, an open region within which it operates. But precisely the opening
up of such a region constitutes the fundamental occurrence in research. This
is accomplished through the projection, within some region of (for example,
natural) beings, of a ground-plan

[Gnmdriss]

of natural processes. Such a

projection maps out in advance the way in which the procedure of knowing
is to bind itself to the region that is opened up. This commitment

[Bindung]

is the rigor of research. Through the projection of the ground-plan and
the prescribing of rigor, procedure secures for itself, within the realm of
being, its sphere of objects. A glance at mathematical physics - the earliest
of modern sciences which is, at the same time, nonnative for the rest - will
make clear what we mean. Insofar as modern atomic physics still remains
physics, what is essential - which is all that concerns us here - will be true
of it as well.
Modern physics is called "mathematical" because it makes usc, in a re­
markable way, of a quite specific kind of mathematics. But it is only able
to proceed mathematically because, in a deeper sense, it is already math­
ematical.

Ta �aer,�crra means, in Greek, that which, in his observation of

beings and interaction with things, man knows in advance: the corporeality
of bodies, the vegetable character of plants, the animality of animals, the
humanness of human beings. Along with these, belonging to the already­
known, i.e., "mathematical," are the numbers. When we discover three ap­
ples on the table we recognize that there are three of them. But the number
three, threeness, we know already. That is to say: the number is some­
thing "mathematical." Only because numbers represent, so to speak, the
most striking of the always-already-known, and therefore the best-known
instances of the mathematical, is "the mathematical" directly reserved as a
name for the numerical. The essence of the mathematical, however, is in
no way defined in terms of the numerical. Physics is, in general, knowledge
of nature. In particular, it is knowledge of material corporeality in mo­
tion; for corporeality manifests itself immediately and universally - albeit
in different ways - in all natural things. When, therefore, physics assumes
an explicitly "mathematical" form, what this means is the following: that
through and for it, in an emphatic way, something is specified in advance as
that which is already known. This specification concerns nothing less than

59

OFF T H E II EATEN TRACK

what, for the sought-after knowledge of nature, is henceforth to count as
"nature": the closed !>)'stem of spatio-temporally related units of mass. Per­
taining to this ground-plan, in accordance with its prior specification, arc
to be found, among others, the following definitions. Motion is change of
place. No motion or direction of motion takes precedence over any other.
Every place is equal to every other. No point in time has precedence over
any other. Every force is defined as - is, that is, nothing but - ito; conse­
quences as motion within the unity of time; and that means, again, change
of place. Every natural event must be viewed in such a way that it fits into
this ground-plan of nature. Only within the perspective of this ground-plan
docs a natural event become visible as such. The ground-plan of nature is
secured in place in that physical research, in each step of investigation, is
obligated to it in advance. This obligation

[Bindung], the rigor of research,

has, at a given time, its own character in keeping with the ground-plan.
The rigor of mathematical science is exactitude. Every event, if it enters
at all into representation as a natural event, is determined, in advance, as a
magnitude of spatia-temporal motion. Such determination is achieved by
means of numbers and calculation. Mathematical research into nature is
not, however, exact because it calculates precisely; rather, it must calculate
precisely becauo;e the way it is bound to its domain of objects has the char­
acter of exactness. The human sciences, by contrast, indeed all the sciences
that deal with living things, precisely in order to remain disciplined and
rigorous, are necessarily inexact. One can, indeed, view living things, too,
as magnitudes of spatia-temporal motion, but what one apprehends is then
no longer living. The inexactness of the historical human sciences is not
a deficienl.)' but rather the fulfillment of an essential requirement of this
type of research. It is true, also, that the projecting and the securing of the
domain of objects is, in the historical sciences, not only different, but far
more difficult to achieve than is the rigor of the exact sciences.
Science becomes research through the projected plan and through the
securing of the plan in the rigor of procedure. Projection and rigor, however,
first develop into what they are in method. Method constitutes the second
essential characteristic of research. If the projected region is to become ob­
jectified, then it must be brought to encounter us in the full multiplicity
of its levels and intcrweavings. Procedure must therefore be free to view
the changeableness in what it encounters. Only from within the perspective
of the ever-otherness of change does the plenitude of the particular, of the
facts, reveal itself. The facts, however, are to become objective. Procedure
must, therefore, represent the changeable i n its changing; it muo;t bring it

6o

Ti l E AGE OF THE WOR L D PICT U R E

to stand and yet allow the motion to remain a motion. The fixedness of
the facts and the constancy of their change as such is the rule. The con­
stancy of change in the necessity of its course is the law. Only from the
perspective of rule and law do facts become clear as what they are. Research
into the facts in the realm of nature is the setting up and confinnation of
rule and law. The method by means of which a domain of objects is repre­
sented has the character of a clarification [Kiiirung) from out of the clear,
of explanation [Erkliirung). Explanation always has two sides to it. It ac­
counts for something unknown through something known, and at the same
time confirms the known through that unl.."llown. Explanation takes place
in investigation. In the natural sciences this happens in the experiment, al­
ways according to the nature of the field of investigation and the kind of
explanation aimed at. However, natural science does not first become re­
search through experiment. It is rather the other way round: experiment
is only possible where knowledge of nature has already transformed itself
into research. It is only because contemporary physics is a physics that is
essentially mathematical that it is capable of being experimental. Since nei­
ther the medieval doctrina nor the Greek rnJo-rTli.ITJ were science in the sense
of research, there was, for them, no question of experiment. lo be sure,
Aristotle was the first to grasp the meaning of EIJTTElpia (experientia): the
observation of the things themselves, their characteristics and alterations
under changing conditions, resulting in knowledge of the way in which
they behave as a rule. But observation directed toward knowledge of this
kind, the experimmtum, is essentially different from that which belongs to
science as research, the research-experiment. It remains essentially differ­
ent even where ancient and medieval observation also works with number
and measure, and even where it makes use of specific apparatus and in­
struments. For what is completely absent here is what is decisive about the
experiment. This begins with the fundamental postulation of a law. lo set
up an experiment is to represent a condition according to which a specific
nexus of motions can become capable of being followed in its necessary
course, which is to say that it can be mastered, in advance, by calculation.
The setting up of the law, however, is accomplished with reference to the
ground-plan of the sphere of objects. This provides the standard and con­
strains the anticipatory representation of the condition. Such representing
with and within which the experiment begins is no arbitrary invention. This
is why Newton says hypotheses rum jingo; the fundamental postulations are
not arbitrarily thought up. They arc, rather, developed out of the ground­
plan of nature and are sketched into it. Experiment is that method which,
61

OFF TI-l E B EATF.;\; TRAC K

in its planning and execution, is supported and guided by what is postulated
as a fundamental law, in order to bring forth the facts which either confirm
the law or deny it such confirmation. The more exact the projection of the
ground-plan of nature the more exact is the possibility of experiment. The
often mentioned medieval scholastic, Roger Bacon, can, therefore, never
be the forerunner of the contemporary experimental researcher but re­
mains, rather, merely the successor of Aristotle. For in the meantime, gen­
uine possession of the truth has, through Christianity, been transferred to
faith - to the truth preserved in the written word and in church doctrine.
The highest knowledge and teaching is theology considered as interpreta­
tion of the divine word of revelation that is recorded in scripture and pro­
claimed by the Church. Here, knowledge is not research but rather right
understanding of the normative word and of the authorities who proclaim it.
For this reason, discussion ofthe words and doctrinal opinions of the various
authorities takes precedence in the process of knowledge-acquisition in the
Middle Ages. The cwzpo11ere scripta

et sermones,

the argummtum

ex verbo, is

decisive and, at the same time, the reason why the Platonic and Aristotelian
philosophy that had been adopted, had to become scholastic dialectic. If,
then, Roger Bacon demands the expe1-immt11m - as he did - what he means
is not the experiment of science as research. Rather he demands, in place of
the arp;ummtum ex verbo, the arp;mnmtum ex t·e;z instead of the discussion of
doctrinal opinions, observations of the things themselves, in other words,
Aristotelian

El.lTrEipla.

The modem research-experiment is, however, not merely an observation
that is more precise in degree and scope. It is, rather, an essentially differ­
ent kind of methodology for the verification of law within the framework
and in the service of an exact projection of nature. In the historical human
sciences "source criticism" corresponds to the experiment of physical re­
search. This name covers, here, the whole range of discovery, examination,
verification, evaluation, preservation, and interpretation. It is indeed true
that the historical explanation based on source-criticism docs not subsume
the facts under laws and rules. Yet i t is not reduced to a mere reporting
of the facts. As in the natural sciences, method in the historical sciences is
aimed at presenting the constant and at making history an object. History
can only be objectified when it is something past. The constancy of the
past, that on the basis of which historical explanation takes into account the
unique and diverse in history, is the having-alway s-already -been-there, that
which can be compared. Through the constant comparisons of everything
with everything else the inteJiigible is worked out and, as the ground-plan

62

THE AG E OF THE WOR L D PICTUR E

of history, certified and secured. The sphere of historical research extends
only

as

far as the reach of historical explanation. The unique, the rare, the

simple - in short, greamcss in history - is never self-evident and hence
remains incapable of explanation. It is not that historical research denies
greamess in history; rather, it explains it as the exception. In such expla­
nation the great is measured against the ordinary and average. There is no
other kind of historical explanation as long as explanation means subsuming
under the intelligible, and as long as historical science remains research, i.e.,
explanation. Because, as research, history projects and objectifies the past.
as an explicable and surveyable nexus of effects, it demands source-criticism
as the instrument of objectification. The standards of such criticism alter to
the degree that historical science approaches journalism.
As research, every science is based on the projection of a bounded object

domain and necessarily posse.'ises, therefore, an individualized character. In
developing its projection through its methodology, moreover, every indi­
vidual science must focus on a particular field of investigation. This focusing
(specialization) is, however, by no means merely the dire side effect of the
increasing unsurveyability of the results of research. It is not a necessary
evil, but rather the essential necessity of science as research. Specialization
is not the consequence but rather the ground of the progress of all research.
Research does not, through its methodology, become dispersed into ran­
dom investigations so as to lose itself in them. For the character of modern
science is determined by a third fundamental occurrence: constant activity

IBetrieb]

(Appendix 2).

By this term is to be understood, first of all, that phenomenon whereby
a science, whether natural or humanistic, in order to achieve proper recog­
nition today as a science is required to be capable of being institutionalized.
Research is not, however, constant activity because its work is carried out
in institutions; rather, institutions are necessary because science, as, intrin­
sically, research, has the character of constant activity. The methodology
through which individual object domains arc conquered does not simply
amass results. Rather, it uses its results to direct itself toward a new proce­
dure. In the mechanical installation that enables physics to smash the atom
we have the whole of physics up to now. Similarly, in historical research , .
the stock o f sources only becomes usable when the sources themselves are
verified by historical explanation.

In these processes the methodology of a

science is circumscribed by its own results. More and more, methodology
adapts itself to the possibilities of procedure it itself opens up. This having­
to-be-based on its own resul ts as the ways and means of a progressing

O FF THE REATE:\' TRACK

methodology, is the e.o;sence of the character of research as constant activ­
ity. That character, however, is the inner ground for the necessity of its
institutional character.
It is in constant activity that the projection of the object domain is, for
the first time, built into beings. All arrangements that facilitate the planned
amalgamation of different types of methodology, promote the reciprocal
checking and communication of results, and regulate the exchange of labor
are measures which are by no means merely the external consequence of the
fact that research work is expanding and diversifying. Rather, they are the
distant and still by no means comprehended sign that modem science begins
to enter the decisive phase of its history. Only now does it take possession
of its own complete essence.
What is going on in the spread and entrenchment of the institutional
�haracter of the sciences? :'\othing less than the establishment of the pre­
cedence of methodology over the beings (of nature and history) which, at a
particular time, are objectified in research. On the basis of their character
as constant activity, the sciences create for themselves the appropriate co­
herence and unity. For this reason, historical or archeological research that
has become institutionally active is essentially nearer to research in physics
that is organized in a similar way than it is to a discipline in its own faculty
of humanities which has remained within mere scholarship. The decisive
unfolding of the character of modern science as constant activity produces,
therefore, a human being of another stamp. The scholar disappears and is
replaced by the researcher engaged in research programs. These, and not
the cultivation of scholarship, are what places his work at the cutting edge

(geben seiner Arbeit die scharfe Luft].

The researcher no longer needs a li­

brary at home. He is, moreover, constantly on the move. He negotiates at
conferences and collects information at congresses. He commits himself to
publishers' commissions. It is publishers who now determine which books
need to be written (Appendix

3).

From an inner compulsion, the researcher presses forward into the sphere
occupied by the figure of, in the essential sense, the technologist. Only
in this way can he remain capable of being effective, and only then, in
the eyes of his age, is he real. Alongside him, an increasingly thinner and
emptier romanticism of scholarship and the university will still be able to
survive for some time at certain places. The effective unity and therefore the
reality of the university, however, does not lie in the spiritual-intellectual

[geistige] power of the primordial unity of the sciences, a power emanating
from the university because nourished and preserved by it. The reality of

Ti l E AGE

01'

TH E WOR L D PIC:Tt: R E

the university is that it is an establishment which still, in a unique way,
on account of its administratively self-contained form, makes possible and
visible both the fragmentation of the sciences into the specialities and the
peculiar unity of constant activity. Because it is in constant activity that the
essential forces of modern science become immediately and unambiguously
effective, it is only self-directed research activities which, proceeding from
themselves, can prefigure and establish an inner unity with other appropriate
research activities.
The real system of science consists in the coherence of procedure and
stance with respect to the objectification of beings, in conformity, at any
given time, with planning. The advantage this system is required to pro­
mote is no contrived and rigid unification of the contents of the object do­
mains. Rather, it is the greatest possible free, though regulated, flexibility in
the changing around and initiation of research with respect to whatever are
the principle tasks of the moment. The more exclusively a science becomes
focused on the complete carrying out and mastery of its process of work­
ing, the more these activities arc - without illusion - shifted into research
institutes and professional schools for research, then the more irresistibly
do the sciences achieve the completion of their modem essence. The more
unconditionally, however, science and research take seriously the modem
shape of their essence, the more unequivocally and immediately arc they
themselves able to stand ready to serve the common good; and the more
unreservedly, too, will they have to withdraw into the public anonymity of
all socially useful work.
Modem science simultaneously founds and differentiates itself in the
projection of particular object domains. These projections are developed by
the appropriate methodologies which are made secure by means of rigor.
Method establishes itself at any given time in constant activity. Projection
and rigor, method and constant activity, each demanding the other, make
up the essence of modern science, make i t into research.
We are reflecting on the essence of modem science in order to discover
its metaphysical ground. What understanding of beings and what concept
of truth is it that underlies the transformation of science into research?
Knowledge as research calls beings to account with regard to the way
in which, and the extent to which, they can be placed at the disposal of
representation. Research has beings at its disposal when it can, through cal­

culation, either predict their future or retrodict their past. In the prediction

of nature and retrodiction of history, nature and history are set in place in
the same way. They become objects of explanatory representation. Such

·

OFF T H E BEATF:� TRACK

representation counts on nature and takes account of history. Only what
becomes, in this way, an object

is - counts

as in being. We first arrive at

science as research when the being of beings is sought in such abjectness.
This objectification of beings is accomplished in a setting-before, a rep­
resenting

[J11r-ste/Jen], aimed at bringing each being before it in such a way

that the man who calculates can be sure - and that means certain - of the
·being. Science as research first arrives when, and only when, truth has trans­
formed itself into the certainty of representation. It is in the metaphysics
of Descartes that, for the first time, the being is defined as the abjectness
of representation, and t:ru.t:J:! a:; t.he ce�;taj.nty qf r_epr<Eseptation. The title of
his main work reads

Meditationes de pri111a philosopbia, Meditations on Fim

Philosophy. npwTTJ <piAOO"O<pla

is the term coined by Aristotle for that

which was later called "metaphysics." The whole of modem metaphy sics,
Nietzsche included, maintains itself within the interpretation of the being
and of truth opened up by Descartes (Appendix 4).
If, now, science as research is an essential phenomenon of modernity,
it must follow that what constitutes the metaphysical ground of research
determines, first, and long in advance, the essence of modernity in general.
The essence of modernity can be seen in humanity 's freeing itself from the
bonds of the Middle Ages in that it frees itself to itself. But this characteri­
zation, though correct, is merely the foreground. And it leads to those mis­
takes which prevent one from grasping the essential ground of modernity
and, proceeding from there, judging the breadth of that essence. Certainly
the modern age has, as a consequence of the liberation of humanity, intro­
duced subjectivism and individualism. But it remains just as certain that no
age before this one has produced a comparable objectivism, and that in no
age before this has the non-individual, in the shape of the collective, been
accorded prestige. Of the essence here is the necessary interplay between
subjectivism and objectivism. But precisely this reciprocal conditioning of
the one by the other refers

us

back to deeper processes.

What is decisive is not that humanity frees itself from previous bonds
but, rather, that the essence of humanity altogether transforms itself in
that man becomes the subject. To be sure, this word "subject" must be
understood as the translation of the Greek

liTroKeh.1evov. The word names

that-which-lies-before, that which, as ground, gathers everything onto it­
self. This metaphysical meaning of the concept of the subject has, in the
first instance, no special relationship to man, and none at all to the I.
When, however, man becomes the primary and genuine

subiectum, this

means that he becomes that being upon which every being, in its way of

66

TH E AGE OF THE WORLD PICT C' R E

being and its truth, is founded. Man becomes the referential center of be­
ings as such. But this is only possible when there is a transformation in
the understanding of beings as a whole. In what does this transformation
manifest itself? What, in accordance with it, is the essence of modernity?
When we reflect on the modem age, we inquire after the modem world
picture. We characterize this by contrasting it with the world picture of the
Middle Ages and of antiquity. But why is it that, in interpreting a historical
age, we inquire into its world picture? Does every historical epoch have its
world picture - have it in such a way, indeed, so as, from time to time, to
concern itself about that picture? Or is it only a modern kind of representing
that inquires into a world picture?
What is it - a "world picture"? Obviously, a picture of the world. But
what is a world? What does "picture" mean here? "World" serves, here,
as a name for beings in their entirety. The term is not confined to the
cosmos, to nature. History, too, belongs to world. But even nature and
history - interpenetrating in their suffusion and exceeding of each other do not exhaust world. Under this tenn we also include the world-ground,
no matter how its relation to world is thought (Appendix 5).
Initially, the word "picture" makes one think of a copy of something.
This would make the world picture, as it were, a painting of beings as a
whole. But "world picture" means more than this. We mean by it the world
itself; the totality of beings taken, as it is for us, as standard-giving and obli­
gating. "Picture" means, here, not a mere imitation, but rather that which
sounds in the colloquial expression to he "in the picture" about something.
This means: the matter itself stands in the way it stands to us, before us.
lo "put oneself in the picture" about something means: to place the being

itself before one just as things are with it, and, as so placed, to keep it per­
manently before one. But a decisive condition in the essence of the picture
is still missing. That we are "in the picture" about something means not
just that the being is placed before, represented by, us. It means, rather, that
it stands before us together with what belongs to and stands together with
it as a system . To be "in the picture" resonates with: being well informed,
being equipped and prepared. Where the world becomes picture, beings as
a whole are set in place as that for which man is prepared; that which, there­
fore, he correspondingly intends to bring before him, have before him, and,
thereby, in a decisive sense, place before him (Appendix 6). Understood in
an essential way, "world picture" docs not mean "picture of the world" but,
rather, the world grasped as picture. Beings as a whole are now taken in•
such a way that a being is first and only in being insofar as it is set in place

O F F Ti lE B E ATEJ'\' TRACK

by representing-producing

[v01"Stellmd-herstellenden]

humanity. Whenever

we have a world picture, an essential decision occurs concerning beings as a
·whole. The being of beings is sought and found in the representedness ofbe­
ings. Where, however, beings are not interpreted in this way, the world, too,
cannot come into the picture - there can be no world picture. That beings
acquire being in and through representedness makes the age in which this
occurs a new age, distinct from its predecessors. The familiar phrases "world
picture of modernity" and "modern world picture" say the same thing
twice. And they presuppose something that could never before have ex­
isted, namely, a medieval and ancient world picture. The world picture
does not change from an earlier medieval to a modern one; rather, that the
world becomes picture at all is what distinguishes the essence of modernity.
For the Middle Ages, by contrast, the being is the

ens

creatum, that which

is created by the personal creator-God who is considered to be the highest
cause. I lere, to be a being means: to belong to a particular rank in the order
of created things, and, as thus created, to correspond to the cause of creation

(analogia entis) (Appendix 7).

But never does the being's being consist in its

being brought before man as the objective. �ever does it consist in being
placed in the realm of man's information and disposal so that, in this way
alone, is it in being.
The modem interpretation of beings is still further removed from that
of the Greeks. One of the oldest expressions of Greek thinking about the
being of beings reads:

To yap a\rro voeiv ea-rlv TE Kal eTva1. 3 This statement

of Parmenides means: the apprehension of beings belongs to being since it
is from being that it is demanded and determined. The being is that which
rises up and opens itself; that which, as what is present, comes upon man, i.e.,
upon him who opens himself to what is present in that he apprehends it. The
being does not acquire being in that man first looks upon it in the sense of
representation that has the character of subjective perception. Rather, man
is the one who is looked upon by beings, the one who is gathered by self­
opening beings into presencing with them. To be looked at by beings," to be
included and maintained and so supported by their openness, to be driven
about by their conflict and marked by their dividedness, that is the essence
of humanity in the great age of Greece. In order to fulfill his essence, there­
fore, man has to gather

(A.eye1v) and save (a�l;elV), catch up and preserve,

the self-opening in its openness; and he must remain exposed to all of its
divisive confusion. Greek humanity

which is the reason that, in the age of the Greeks, the world can never be­
come picture. On the other hand, however, is the fact that the beingness of
beings is defined, for Plato, as

el8os (appearance, view). This is the presup­

position which - long prevailing only mediately, in concealment and long in
advance - predestined the world's having to become picture (Appendix 8).
In distinction from the Greek apprehension, modem representing,
whose signification is first expressed by the word reprnesentatio, means some­
thing quite different. Representation

[ Vor-stellm]

here means: to bring the

present-at-hand before one as something standing over-and-against, to re­
late it to oneself, the representer, and, in this relation, to force it hack to
oneself as the nonn-giving domain. \Vhere this happens man "puts himself
in the picture" concerning beings. \Vhen, however, in this way, he docs this,
he places himself in the scene; in, that is, the sphere of what is generally and
publicly represented. And what goes along with this is that man sets himself
forth as the scene in which, henceforth, beings must set-themselves-before,
prc.'icnt themselves - be, that is to say, in the picture. Man becomes the
representative

[Rep1·iisentant] of beings in the sense of the objective.

\Vhat is new, however, in this occurrence does not at all consist in the
fact, merely, that the position of man in the midst of beings is other than it
was for ancient of medieval man. \Vhat is decisive is that man specifically
takes up this position as one constituted by himself, intentionally maintains
it as that taken up by himself, and secures it in place as the basis for a possible
development of hwnanity. Now for the first time there exists such a thing
as the "position" of man. Man makes depend on himself the way he is to
stand to beings as the objective. What begins is that mode of hwnan being
which occupies the realm of human capacity as the domain of measuring
and execution for the purpose of the mastery of beings as a whole. The age
that is determined by this event is not only new in retrospective comparison
with what had preceded it. It is new, rather, in that it explicitly sets itself up
as the new. To be "new" belongs to a world that has become picture.
If, then, we wish to clarify the pictorial character of the world as the
representedness of beings, then in order fully to grasp the modem essence of
representedness we must scent out the original naming power of that worn­
out word and concept "to represent": to put forth and relate to oneself. It is
through this that the being comes to stand as an object and so first receives
the seal of being. That the world becomes picture is one and the same process
whereby, in the midst of beings, man becomes subject (Appendix 9).
Only because and insofar as man, altogether and essentially, has become�
subject is it necessary for him to confront, as a consequence, this explicit

OFF TI-l E B EATE::-.1 TRACK

question: is it as an "I'' that is reduced to its random desires and abandoned
to an arbitrary free-will or as the "we" of society; is it as individual or as
community; is it as a personal being within the community or as a mere
member of the body corporate; is it as a state, nation, or people or as the
indifferent humanity of modem man, that man wills and must be that subject
which, as the essence of modernity, he akeady is? Only where, in essence,
man has become subject does there exist the possibility of sliding into the
unbeing of subjectivism in the sense of individualism. But it is also the
case that only where man remains subject does it make any sense to struggle
explicitly against individualism and for the community as the goal and arena
of all achievement and utility.
•
The interweaving of these two processes - that the world become.'i pic­
ture and man the subject - which is decisive for the essence of modernity
illuminates the founding process of modem history, a process that, at first
sight, seems almost nonsensical. The process, namely, whereby the more
completely and comprehensively the world, as conquered, stands at man's
disposal, and the more objectively the obje<."t appears, all the more sub­
jectively (i.e., peremptorily) does the subiectum rise up, and all the more
inexorably, too, do observations and teachings about the world transform
themselves into a doctrine of man, into an anthropology. No wonder that
humanism first arises where the world becomes picture. In the great age
of the Greeks, however, it was as impossible for a humanism to gain cur­
rency as it was for there to be anything like a world picture. Hun1anism,
therefore, in the narrower, historical sense, is nothing but a moral-aesthetic
anthropology. The name "anthropology," here, does not refer to an inves­
tigation of humanity by natural science. Neither doe.<; it mean the doctrine
established within Christian theology concerning created, fallen, and re­
deemed humanity. It designates, rather, that philosophical interpretation of
man which explains and evaluates beings as a whole from the standpoint of,
and in relation to, man (Appendix 1 0).
The ever more exclusive rooting of the interpretation of the world in
anthropology which has set in since the end of the eighteenth century finds
expression in the fact that man's fundamental relation to beings as a whole is
defined as a world view [Weltanschauung] . It is since then that this term has
entered common usage. A'i soon as the world becomes picture the position
of man is conceived as world view. It is, to be sure, easy to misunderstand the
term "world view," to suppose it to have to do merely with a disengaged con­
templation of the world. For this reason, already in the nineteenth century,
it was rightly emphasized that "world view" also means, and even means

Ti l E A G E OF T H E WO R L D PICT U R E

primarily, "view of life." The fact that, nonetheless, "world view" has as­
serted itself as the name for the position of man in the midst of beings proves
how decisively the world becomes picture as soon as man makes his life as
subject the primary center of reference. This means: the being counts as in
being only to the degree and extent that it is taken into, and referred back
to, this life, i.e., is lived out [e1·-/ebt), and becomes life-experience [Er-lebnis].
Ao:. every humanism had to remain something unsuited to Greece, so a "me­
dieval world view" was an impossibility; and a "Catholic world view" is an
absurdity. Just as, for modern man, the more unbounded the way in which .
he takes charge of the shaping of his essence, everything must, by both ne­
cessity and right, become "experience," just as certainly, the Greeks at the
Olympic festivals could never have had "experiences."
The fundamental event of modernity is the conquest of the world as
picture. From now on the word "picture" means: the collective image of
representing production [das Gebild des vorstellenden I-lerstellens]. Within this,
man fights for the position in which he can be that being who gives to
every being the measure and draws up the guidelines. Because this po­
sition secures, organizes, and articulates it.'ielf as world view, the decisive
unfolding of the modern relationship to beings becomes a confrontation
of world views; not, indeed, any old set of world views, but only those
which have already taken hold of man's most fundamental stance with the
utmost decisiveness. For the sake of this battle of world views, and accord­
ing to its meaning, humanity sets in motion, with respect to everything,
the unlimited process of calculation, planning, and breeding. Science as
research is the indispensable fonn taken by this self-establishment in the
world; it is one of the pathways along which, with a speed unrecognized
by those who are involved, modernity race.'i towards the fulfillment of its
essence. With this battle of world views modernity first enters the deci­
sive period of its history, and probably the one most capable of enduring
(Appendix I I).
A sign of this event is the appearance everywhere, and in the most varied
fonns and disguises, of the gigantic. At the same time, the huge announces
itself in the direction of the ever smaller. We have only to think of the num­
bers of atomic physics. The gigantic presses forward in a form which seems
to make it disappear: in destruction of great distances by the airplane, in
the representations of foreign and remote worlds in their everydayness pro­
duced at will by the flick of a switch. One thinks too superficially, however,
if one takes the gigantic to he merely an endlessly extended emptiness of
the purely quantitative. One thinks too briefly if one fmds the gigantic,

O F F TH E BEATE� TRACK

in the form of the continual never-having-been-here-before, to spring
merely from a blind impulse to exaggerate and excel. One thinks not at
all if one takes oneself to have explained this appearance of the gigantic
with the slogan "Americanism" (Appendix u).
The gigantic is, rather, that through which the quantitative acquires its
own kind of quality, becoming thereby, a remarkable form of the great. A
historical age is not only great in a different way from others; it also has,
in every case, its own concept of greatness. As soon, however, as the gigan­
tic, in planning, calculating, establishing, and securing, changes from the
quantitative and becomes its own special quality, then the gigantic and the
seemingly completely calculable become, through this shift, incalculable.
This incalculability becomes the invisible shadow cast over all things when
man has become the �ubiectll71l and world has become picture (Appendix I 3).
Through this shadow the modern world withdraws into a space beyond
representation and so lends to the incalculable its own determinateness
and historical uniqueness. This shadow, however, point.c; to something else,
knowledge of which, to us moderns, is refused (Appendix I 4)· Yet man will
never be able to experience and think this refusal as long as he goes around
merely negating the age. The flight into tradition, out of a combination of
humility and presumption, achieves, in itself, nothing, is merely a closing
the eyes and blindness towards the historical moment (Augenblick].
Man will know the incalculable - that is, safeguard it in it.'i truth - only
in creative questioning and fanning from out of the power of genuine re­
flection. Reflection transports the man of the future into that "in-between"
in which he belongs to being and yet, amidst beings, remains a stranger
(Appendix I s). Holderlin knew about this. l lis poem, above which is writ­
ten ""lb the Germans," closes:-l
True, narrowly bounded is our lifetime,

Such reflection is neither necessary for all nor is it to be accomplished,
or even found bearable, by everyone. On the contrary, absence of reflection
belongs, to a very great extent, to the particular stages of accomplishing
and being constantly active. The questioning that belongs to reflection,
however, does not fall into that which is groundles.c; and beyond question­
ing because, in advance, it asks after being. This remains that which is
most worthy of question [Frngewiirdigste]. Reflection finds in being the ut­
most rc.c;istance, which constrains it to deal seriously with beings as they
are drawn into the light of their being. Reflection on the essence of moder­
nity places thought and decision within the sphere of effectiveness belong­
ing to the authentically essential forces of the age. These forces work, as
they work, beyond the reach of everyday evaluation. With respect to such
forces there is only preparedness for the resolution or else the evasive turn­
ing to the ahistorical. In this connection, however, it is not sufficient, for
example, to affinn technology or, out of a stance incomparably more es­
sential, to set up "total mobilization" as an absolute, once it is recognized
as being at hand.5 It is a matter of, in advance and continually, grasping
the essence of the age from out of the truth of being that prevails in it;
for only thus is that which is most-worthy-of-questioning simultaneously
experienced - that which bears and constrains a creating into the future
which takes us beyond what is at hand, and lets the transfonnation of hu­
manity become one that springs from the necessity of being itseiP No
age lets itself be done away with by a negating decree. Negation merely
throws the negator off the track. Modernity requires, however, in order,
in the future, for it to be resisted in its essence and on the strength of
that essence, an originality and breadth of reflection for which, perhaps, we
modems can prepare somewhat, but over which we can certainly never gain
mastery.

rative sense. Yet because the essence of research is constant activity, the

indu.<>trious activity of mere busyness [Beniebsamkeit des blofletl Beniebs]
which is always a possibility, creates the appearance of a higher reality be­
hind which the excavations of research-work are accomplished. Constant
activity becomes mere busyness when its methodology no longer holds itself
open on the basis of an ever new completion of its projection, but rather
leaves this behind as something simply given and no longer ever requir­
ing confirmation; instead, all it does is to chase after results piling on top
of each other and their calculation. Mere busyness must, at all times, be
resisted - precisely because, in its essence, research is constant activity. If
one seeks to discover the scientific in science merely in serene erudition,
then it indeed seems as though the repudiation of constant activity would
also be the denial of the essential character of research as constant activity.
\¥hat, however, is certainly true is that the more completely research be­
comes constant activity and in this way becomes fruitful, the more steadily
there grows within it the danger of becoming mere busyness. In the end we
reach a situation where the difference between constant activity and busy­
ness [Benieb tmd BehiebJ is not only unrecognizable, but has become unreal.
Precisely the leveling out of its essence and non-essence in the averageness
of the taken-for-granted, makes research - as the shape of science and so
of modernity in general - capable of enduring. But where, within constant
activity, is research to discover a counter-balance to mere busyness?

(3) The growing importance of the publishing business is not merely based
on the fact that the publishers (through, for example, the book trade) have
a better eye for the needs of the public, or that they understand business
better than do authors. Rather, their distinctive work takes the fonn of a
process of planning and organizing aimed, through the planned and lim­
ited publication of books and periodicals, at bringing the world into the
picture the public has of it and securing it there. The predominance of
collected works, sets of books, journal series, and pocket editions is al­
ready the result of this work on the part of the publishers. This work co­
incides, in turn, with the aims of researchers, since these not only become
more easily and rapidly known and respected through series and collec­
tions, but also, along a wider front, immediately achieve their intended
effect.
(4) The metaphysical foundation of Descartes' position is taken over histor­
ically from Platonic-Aristotelian metaphysics. Despite its new beginning,
it attends to the very same question: what is the being? That this question
is not explicitly posed in Descartes' Meditations only goes to prove how

74

T i l E AGE OF T i l E WORLD PICTU R E

essentially the fundamental position determines a transformation i n the an­
swer to it. It is Descartes' interpretation of beings and of truth which first
creates the preconditions for the possibility of a theory or metaphysics of
knowledge. Through Descartes, realism is for the first time put in the posi­
tion of having to prove the reality of the external world, of having to rescue
the being as such.
The essential modifications of Descartes' fundamental position which
have been achieved by German thinking since Lcibniz in no way overcome
this fundamental position. They only expand its metaphysical scope and
establish the preconditions of the nineteenth century - still the most ob­
scure of all the centuries up to now. They indirectly reinforce Descartes'
fundamental position in a form that is scarcely recognizable, yet not,
on that account, any the less real. By contrast, mere Cartesian scholas­
ticism, together with its rationalism, has lost all power for the further
shaping of the character of moderni ty. With Descartes, there begins the
completion of Western metaphysics. Since, however, such a completion
is only possible as metaphysics, modem thinking has its own kind of
greatness.
With the interpretation of man as subiectzmz, Descartes created the meta­
physical presupposition for future anthropology of every kind and tendency.
In the rise of anthropologies he celebrates his greatest triumph. Through
anthropology, the transition of metaphysics into the event of the simple
cessation and suspension of all philosophy is inaugurated. That Dilthey dis­
avowed metaphysics - that, at bottom, he no longer understood its question
and stood helpless before metaphysical logic - is the inner consequence of
the anthropological character of his fundamental position. I lis "philosophy
of philosophy" is a leading example of anthropology's doing away with - as
opposed to overcoming - philosophy. This is why every anthropology that
makes usc of philosophy as the occasion arises, yet simultaneously declares
it to be, as philosophy, superfluous, has the advantage of seeing clearly what
is demanded by the affirmation of anthropology. Through this, the intel­
lectual situation is somewhat clarified. The laborious fabrication of such
absurd entities as "National Socialist philosophies," on the other hand,
merely creates confusion. The world view indeed needs and makes use of
philosophical erudition, but it needs no philosophy since, as world view,
it has already adopted its own interpretation and structuring of what is.
But one thing, surely, even anthropology' cannot do. It cannot overcome
Descartes, nor even resist him. For how could the consequence ever attack
the ground on which it stands?

75

O FF THE BEATEl': TRACK

Descartes can only he overcome through the overcoming of that which
he himself founded, through the overcoming, namely, of modern (and that
means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics. "Overcoming" means here,
however, the primal asking of the question of the meaning of being; of, that
is, the sphere of projection and with it the truth of being. This question
unveils it'iclf as, at the same time, the question of the being of truth.
(5) The conception of the world as developed in

Being a11d Time

is to

be understood only within the perspective of the question about "being­
there

[Da-sein]."

This question remains, for its part, closely connected

with the fundamental question concerning the meaning of being (not of
beings).
(6) 'lb the essence of the picture belongs standing-together, system. By this,
however, we do not mean the artificial, external simplification and collecting
together of the given but, rather, the unfolding, developing unity of struc­
ture within that which is set-before, represented as such, which arises from
the projection of the abjectness of beings. In the Middle Ages a system is
impossible. For there, all that is essential is the order of correspondences or,
more precisely, the order of beings in the sense of what is created and, as his
creation, watched over by God. System is still more foreign to Greece - even
though, these days, one speaks, in a quite unjustified way, of the Platonic
and Aristotelian "systems." The constant activity of research is a particular
embodiment and ordering of the systematic, in which, at the same time,
the latter reciprocally determines the ordering. When the world becomes
picture, system achieves dominion - and not only in thought. Where system
takes the lead, however, there always exists the possibility of its degeneration
into the externality of a system that is merely fabricated and pieced together.
This is what happens when the original power of the projection remains
absent. The uniqueness of the systematic of Leibniz, Kant, Fichte, Hegel,
and Schelling - a systematic that is inherently diverse - has still not been
understood. The greatness of the systematic of these thinkers consists in the
fact that it does not unfold, as with Descartes, out of the sttbiectum as ego and

substantiaji11ita. Rather, it unfolds either, as with

Leibniz, out of the monad

or, as with Kant, out of the transcendental essence of finite reason rooted
in the imagination, or, as with Fichte, out of the infinite "1," or,

as

with

I Iegel, out of the spirit of absolute knowledge, or, finally, as with Schelling,
from out of freedom as the necessity of every particular being which, as
such a being, remains determined through the distinction between ground
and existence.

TilE A G E OF TH E WOR L D PICTURE

No less essential to the modem interpretation of beings is the represen­
tation of value. Where beings have become objects of representation, there,
for the first time, in a certain sense, a loss of being occurs. This loss - vaguely
and uncertainly enough perceived - is correspondingly quickly made up for
through the fact that we attribute to the object and the thus-interpreted
being a value; in general, we assess beings according to values and make
them the goal of all action and activity. Since this latter conceives itself as
culture, values become "cultural values" and these become the general ex­
pression of the highest goals of creation devoted to the self-establishment
of man as subiectum. From here it is only a short step to making values
into objects in themselves. Values become the objectification of needs as
goals brought about by a representing self-establishment within the world
as picture. Values appear to be the expression of the fact that, in relation
to them, man strives to promote precisely what is most valuable. In fact,
however, it is precisely "values" that are the powerless and threadbare mask
of the objectification of beings, an objectification that has become flat and
devoid of background. No one dies for mere values. For the sake of il­
luminating the nineteenth century, we should note, here, the intennedi­
ate position of Hermann Lotze. At the same time as he was interpreting
Plato's ideas as values, Lotze undertook, under the title Microcosmos, that
Attempt at an Anthropology ( 1 856) which, while still drawing on the spirit
of German idealism for the nobility and simplicity of its mode of thinking,
at the same time also opened that thinking to positivism. Because Niet7.sche's thought remains imprisoned in value-representation, he has to ex­
press what is essential to him in a retrospective form as the revaluation of
all values. Only when we succeed in grasping Nietzsche's thought indepen­
dently of value-representation, do we achieve a standpoint from which the
work of the last thinker of metaphysics can be comprehended as an exer­
cise in questioning, and his antagonjsm to Wagner as a necessity of our
history.
(7) Correspondence, thought as the fundamental feature of the being of
beings, provides the pattern for the very definite possibilities and ways in
which the truth of this being of beings, within beings, sets itself into the
work. The artwork of the Middle Ages and the absence of a world picture
during this age belong together.
(8) But did not a Sophist at about the time of Socrates venture to say that
"Man is the measure of all things, of what are, that they are, of what are
not, that they are not"? Does not this statement of Protagoras sound as
77

OFF TH E BEATF.I' TRACK

though it were Descartes speaking? Is it not through Plato that the be­
ing of beings is fully grasped as the visible, the i6ea? Is not the relation
to beings as such, for Aristotle, pure looking? And yet it is no more the
case that Protagoras' Sophistic statement is subjectivism than it is the case
that Descartes had the capacity to bring about the overturning of Greek
thought. Through Plato's thinking and Aristotle's questioning there oc­
turred, to be sure, a decisive transfonnation of the interpretation of beings
and of man. But this transformation always remained within the Greeks'
fundamental experience of beings. Precisely as a struggle against the So­
phistic, and so as dependent on it, this transformed interpretation proves
so decisive as to become the ending of the Greek world, an ending which
indirectly helps to prepare the possibility of the modem age. This is the
reason that, later on, not just in the Middle Ages but right through the
modern age and up to the present, Platonic and Aristotelian thought was
able to be taken as Greek thought per se, and why all pre-Platonic thought
could be considered to be merely a preparation for Plato. Because we have
long been accustomed to understand Greece in terms of a modem hu­
manistic interpretation, it remains denied to us to think being as it opened
itself to Greek antiquity, to think it in a way that allows it its ownness and
strangeness.
Protagoras' statement reads:

(cf. Plato's

11Jenetet7ts 1 5 2a)

Of all things (those, namely, that man has around him in use and usage, XPil­

j.lcrra

xpiia&a•) man is (in each <.:asc} the measure, of what presences, that it

so presences, of that, however, to which prcscncing is denied, that it docs not
presence.

The being whose being is up for decision is understood, here, as that which is
present in the sphere ofman, arriving in this region, ofitself. Who, however,
is "man"? Plato tells us in the same passage hy having Socrates say:
Does he (Protagoras} not understand this somewhat as follows? \Vhatever, at a
given time, something shows itself to me as, of such an aspect is it (also) for me; but
whatever it shows itself to you as, is it not such in turn for you? But you are a man
just as much as I.

Man is here, accordingly, the man in each particular case (I and you,
he and she). And should not this eyw coincide with Descartes' ego cogito?

TH E AGE OF TilE WORLD PICTU R E

Never. For in every es.o;ential respect, what determines the two fundamental
metaphysical positions with equal necessity is different. What is essential
to a fundamental metaphysical position embraces:

(1) The manner and way in which man is man, that is, himself: the es­
sential nature of selfhood which by no means coincides with 1-ncss,
but is rather determined by the relationship to being as such.

(z) The essential interpretation of the being of beings.
(3) The essential projection of truth.
(4) The sense in which, in any given instance, "man is the measure."
None of the essential moments of the fundamental metaphysical position
can be understood apart from the others. Each, by itself, indicates the totality
of a fundamental metaphysical position. For what reason, and to what extent,
just these four moments bear and structure a fundamental metaphysical
position in advance is a question which can no longer be asked or answered
out of or through metaphysics. To ask it is already to speak out of the
overcoming of metaphysics.

�yw. Of
I? The eyw stays, in the sphere of that

For Protagoras, to be sure, beings remain related to man as
what kind is this relation to the

which is apportioned to it as this particular unconcealment. Accordingly, it
apprehends everything that presences within this sphere as in being. The ap­
prehending of what presences is grounded in this staying within the sphere
of unconcealment. The belonging of the I to what presences

is through

this staying alongside what presences. This belonging to what presences
in the open draws the boundary between what is present and what absent.
From out of this boundary man receives and preserves the measure of that
which presences and that which absences. In his restriction to that which
is unconcealed at a particular time, man gives himself the measure which
confines a self in each case to this and that. Man does not set the measure to
which all beings in their being here have to accommodate themselves, out
of a detached 1-ncss. One who stands in the Greek.., ' fundamental relation­
ship to beings and their unconcealment is

�hpov (measure) insofar as he

accept'i restriction to the sphere of unconcealment limited after the manner
of the I; and, as a consequence, acknowledges the concealment of beings
and that their presence or absence, together with the visible appearance of
what is present, lies beyond his power of decision. This is why Protagoras
says (Fragment 4 in Diels,

In view of this thoughtful circumspection on Protagoras' part, it is no
wonder that Socrates says of him (Plato, Theaetetus 1 5 2 b) eiKOS iJEVTOI
aocpov av6pa iJTJ AT)peiv. "We may suppose that he (Protagoras), as a sen­
sible person , was not (in his statement about man as the 11hpov) simply
babbling."
The fundamental metaphysical position of Protagoras is merely a nar­
rowing down - which means, nonetheless, a preserving - of the fundamental
position of Heraclitus and Parmenides. Sophism is only possible on the basis
of aocpia, i.e., on the basis of the Greek interpretation of being as presence
and truth as unconcealment - an unconcealment which remains itself an
essential detennination of being, which is why that which presences is de­
termined out of unconcealment, and presencing out of the unconcealed
as such. But how far removed is Descartes from this beginning of Greek
thought, how different is the interpretation of man which represents him as
subject? In the concept of the subiectum, there still lingers on the sound of
the Greek essence of being (the liTToKEia6at of the liTToKeliJevov) in the form
of a presencing that has become unrecognizable and unquestioned (namely,
that which lies permanently at hand). Precisely because of this, we can rec­
ognize in this concept of presencing the transformation of the fundamental
metaphysical position.
It is one thing to preserve the always limited sphere of unconcealment
through the apprehension ofwhat presences (man as 11hpov). It is something
different to proceed into the unlimited region of possible objectification
through the calculating of the representable of which everyone is capable
and which is binding on all.
Every subjectivism is impossible within Greek Sophism since man can
never, here, become subiect1m1. This cannot happen because, in Sophism,
being is presencing and truth is unconcealment.
In unconcealment, cpaVTaala happens: the coming to appearance, as a
particular something, of that which presences - for man, who himself pres­
ences to what appears. Man as the representing subject fantasizes, however:
he moves in imaginatio in that his representation imagines the being as object
into the world as picture.

(9) I low does i t happen a t all that that which i s sets it.'ielf forth, in an emphatic
way, assubiectum, with the result that the subjective achieves dominance? For
up to Descartes, and still within his metaphysics, the being, insofar as it is a
being, is a sub-iectum (v1To-Kei1Jevov); something which lies before us from out
of itself and which, as such, lies at the foundation of both its own permanent
characteristics and its changing circumstances. The preference given to a

sub-iect:tmt

(that which lies at the basis as ground) which is preeminent in

that it is, in an essential respect, unconditioned, stems from man's demand
for a fundamentum absoluf1tm inconcttssmn veritatis; for an unshakable ground
of truth, in the sense of certainty, which rests in itself. Why and how does
this demand come to have decisive validity? The demand springs from the
liberation of humanity from the bonds of the truth of Christian revelation
and the doctrines of the Church, a liberation which frees itself for a self­
legislation that is grounded in itself. Through this liberation the essence of
freedom - being bound to something that binds - is posited anew. Because,
however, in accordance with this freedom, self-liberating man himself posits
what is obligatory, this cru1 henceforth be defined in different ways. The
obligatory may be human reason and its law; it may be beings, set up and
ordered as objects by such a reason; or it may be that chaos - not yet ordered
and only to be mastered through objectification - which, in a certain age,
comes to demand mastery.
This liberation, however, without knowing it, is still freeing itself from
the bonds of the truth of revelation in which the salvation of man's soul is
made certain and guaranteed. Hence this liberation from the certainty of
salvation disclosed by revelation has to be, in itself, a liberation

to a certainty

in which man secures for himself the true as that which is known through
his own knowing. That was only possible in that self-liberating man him­
self guaranteed the certainty of the knowable. This, however, could only
happen through man's deciding, from and for himself, what was knowable
for him, and what the knowing and securing of the known, i.e., certainty,
should mean. Descartes' metaphysical task became the following: to create
the metaphysical ground for the freeing of man to freedom considered as
self-detennination that is certain of itself. This ground, however, not only
had to be one that was certain. Since every measure taken from other do­
mains was forbidden, it had, at the same time, also to be of such a nature
that, through it, the essence of the freedom demanded was posited as a
self-certainty. Everything that is certain from itself must, at the same time,
however, certify as certain that being from which such knowledge is certain
and through which everything knowable is made secure. Thefundamenf11m ,

OFF TilE BEATE:-.1 TRACK

the foundation at the basis of this freedom, the S'ltbiectum, must be some­
thing certain which satisfies the aforementioned essential requirements. A
S'ltbiectum distinguished in all these respects becomes necessary. "What is this
certainty which forms and provides the ground? It is the
sum.

ego cogito (e71fO)

This certainty is a principle which says that, simultaneously with man's

thinking (at the same time and lasting an equal length of time), he himself
is indubitably co-present; is, that is, given to himself. Thinking is represen­
tation, setting-before, a representative relation to the represented

(idea as

pe1·ceptio).
To represent means here: of oneself, to set something before one and to
make what has been set in place [Jas Geste/lte] secure as thus set in place. This
placing-in-securedness must be a calculating, since only calculation guar­
antees being certain, in advance and always, of that which is to be presented.
Representing is no longer the apprehending of what presences within whose
unconcealment the apprehending it.'iclfbelongs, belongs, indeed, as its own
kind of presence to the things that are unconcealedly present. Representa­
tion is no longer the self-disclosure for . . . but rather the laying hold and
grasping of . . . . That which presences does not hold sway; rather, setting­
upon rules. According to the new freedom, representation is now some­
thing that proceeds from itself into the region of the secured, a region
which has first to be made secure. The being is no longer that which pres­
ences. Rather, it is that which, in representation, is first set over and against

[entgegm Gestellte],

with the character of an object

[Gegen-stiindige].

Repre­

sentation, setting-before, is a making everything stand over and against as
object

[ Ver-gegen-stiindiichung]

which masters and proceeds against.

In this

way, representation drives everything into the unity of the thus-objectified.
Representation is

coagitatio.

Every relationship to something - will, point of view, sensibility - is
already representing. It is cogitans, which one translates as "thinking." This
is why Descartes is able to label all forms of the

volmztns and affictus, all
actiones and passiones with the at first strange-sounding name "cogitntio." In
the ergo cogito sum, the cogitare is understood in this essential and new sense.
The subiectum, the fundamental certainty, is that always secured entity which
representing man always co-represents along with human or non-human
beings, along, that is, with the objectified. The fundamental certainty is the

me-cogitnrc = me e.r�·e

which is, at all times, indubitably representable and

represented. This is the fundamental equation of all calculating belonging
to self-securing representing. In this fundamental certainty, man becomes
certain that, as the representer of all representation, the setter-before of all

Ti l E AGE O F THE WORLD PICTURE

setting-before, and therewith the realm of all representedness and hence of
all certainty and truth, he is securely established - which means, now, that he

is. Only because, in the fundamental certainty (in thefondamentum absolutll11t
inc011C1tsSU111 of the me cogitnre = 1/te esse), man is necessarily co-represented;
only because man who has been liberated to himself belongs, of necessity,
within the subiectum of this freedom - only for this reason can and must this
man himself become the preeminent being, a mbiectu111 which, in respect of

the primary [ente] true (i.e., certain) beings, takes precedence over all other
subiecta. That is the fundamental equation of certainty. The fact, therefore,
that in the authentic subiecttmz, the ego is named, does not mean that man
now becomes an 1-ness and is egoistically defined. It means only this: to be
the subject now becomes the distinctiveness of man, of man as the being
that thinks and represents. The human "I" is placed in the service of this

subiectum. The certainty lying at the foundation of this mbiectu111 is, as such,
indeed subjective i.e., holding sway in the essence of the s11biecttmt, but is
not egoistic. In the same way, everything that is to be secured by means of
representing objectification, and is established thereby as in being, is binding
for everyone. From this objectification, however, which is at the same time
the decision as to what may count as an object, nothing can escape. To the
essence of the subjectivity of the subiectum, and of man as subject, belongs
the unconditional delimiting forth

[Entschriinkung] of the sphere of possible

objectification and the right to determine this objectification.
We have now explained the sense in which man is, and must be, the
subject, measure, and center of beings: of, that is, objects
which stand over and against

[Of1ekte], things

[Gegenstiinde]. Man is no longer the �hpov in

the sense of restraining his apprehension to the sphere of the unconceal­
ment of what presences at his time - the sphere toward which man then
presences. A'i

subiectum

man is the

co-ngitatio

of the

ego.

Man establishes

himself as the measure of all measures with which whatever can count as
certain, i.e., true, i.e., in being, is measured off and measured out. Free­
dom is new as the freedom of the

philosophin

subiectum. In

the

Meditnti(mes de p1-i111n

the liberation of man to his new freedom is brought to that

which grounds it. The liberation of modem humanity does not first begin
with the

ego cogito ergo mm,

and neither is the metaphysics of Descartes

merely supplied later on as something built on externally, a metaphysics in
the sense of an ideology. In the co-agitBtio representation gathers everything
that is an object in the gatheredness of representedness. The

ego

of the

cogitm·e now discovers, in the self-securing togetherness of representedness,
in the con-sciemio, its essence. C011scientia is the representing gathering of

OFF Ti l E R EATE:\' TRACK

the objectual together with the representing man within the sphere of rep­
resented ness which he preserves. Everything that presences receives from
out of this representedness the meaning and mode of its presence

[Amvesm­
heit]; the meaning and mode, that is, of presence [Pmesenz) in 1·epmesentatio.
The con-sciemia of the ego as the mbiectum of the coagitatio, the subjectiv­
ity of the subiecttmt marked out in the above way, detennines the being of
beings.
The Meditationes de prima philosophin provide the pattern for the ontology
of the std1iectm11 constructed from the perspective of a subjectivity defined as

consdentin. Man has become the subiectum. He can, therefore, detem1ine and
realize the essence of subjectivity - always according to how he conceives
and wills himself. Man as the rational being of the Enlightenment is no less
subject than man who grasps himself as nation, wills himself as people

[ Volk],

nurtures himself as race and, finally, empowers himself as lord of the earth.
Now in all these fundamental positions of subjectivism, too, different kinds
of l-ness and egoism are possible; for man is always defined as I and thou,
we and you. Subjective egoism for which - usually without knowing it - the

I is pre-detennined as subject can be beaten down through the insertion
of the I into the we. Through this, subjectivity only gains in power. In
the planetary imperialism of technically organized man the subjectivism of
man reaches its highest point from which it wiiJ descend to the flatness of
organized unifom1ity and there establish itself. This uniformity becomes
the surest instrument of the total, i.e., technological, dominion over the
earth. The modern freedom of subjectivity is completely absorbed into the
corresponding objectivity. By himself, man cannot abandon this destining of
his modem essence; he cannot abolish it by fiat. But he can, in thoughtful
anticipation, ponder this: that mankind's being a subject is not the only
possibility of the primal essence of historical humanity there has ever been
or ever will be. The shadow of a passing cloud over a hidden land - that is
the darkening which truth as the certainty of subjectivity (a truth prepared
for by the certainty of salvation of Christianity) lays over an Event [Ereig11ir]
that it remains denied to subjectivity to experience.
( 1 o) Anthropology is that interpretation of humanity which already knows,
fundamentally, who man is and can, therefore, never ask who he might be.
For with this question it would have to confess itself shaken and overcome.
But how is this to be expected of anthropology when the task is specifically
to achieve nothing but the securing that follows from the self-security of
the mbiecttmt?

THE AGE OF Ti l E WORLD PI CTt; R E

( I I) For what is happening now is the melting down of the self-completing
essence of modernity into the obvious. Only when this is secured as a world
view will the possibility arise of a fertile ground for being to become capable
of a primal questioning - a question-worthiness which opens the leeway for
the decision as to whether being will once more be capable of a god, as
to whether the essence of the truth of being will make a more primordial
claim upon the essence of man. Only when the completion of the modern
age affirms the ruthlessness of its own greatness is future history being
prepared.

( 1 2 ) Americanism is something European. It is that still uncomprehended
species of the gigantic - the gigantic that is still not properly assembled
and still fails to arise from the complete and collected essence of modernity.
The American interpretation of Americanism in terms of pragmatism still
remains outside the realm of metaphysics.
( I 3) Everyday opinion sees in the shadow merely the absence oflight, if not
its complete denial. But, in truth, the shadow is the manifest, though impen­
etrable, testimony of hidden illumination. Conceiving of the shadow this
way, we experience the incalculable as that which escapes representation,
yet is manifest in beings and points to the hidden being [Sein].
(I4) But what if the refusal itself had to become the highest and hardest dis­
closure of being? Conceived from out ofmetaphysics (i.e., from the question
of being in the form "VVhat is the being?") the hidden essence of being, the
refusal, reveals itself first of all as the absolute non-being, as the nothing.
But the nothing, as the nothing of beings is the keenest opponent of mere
negating. The nothing is never nothing, and neither is it a something in
the sense of an object; it is being itself whose truth will be given over to
man when he has overcome himself as subject, when, that is, he no longer
represents beings as objects.
( I 5) This open in-between is the being-there (Da-sein], understanding the

word in the sense of the ecstatic region of the disclosure and concealment
of being.

Hegel's Concept ofExperiencea

"Science of the Experience of Com;ciousness" - this is the title which Hegel
put at the head of

The Phenomenology of Spirit when

it was published in

1 8o7. The word "experience" is printed in boldface midway between the

two other terms. "Experience" identifies what "phenomenology" is. What is
Hegel thinking by stressing the word "experience" in this way? The answer
is provided by the passage which, following after the "Preface" to the System

ofScience, inaugurates the work. The

text in the original edition runs: •

[ 1 ] It is natural to suppose that, before philosophy enters upon the matter
proper to it - namely, the real knowledge of what truly is - it is necessary
to come first to an understanding concerning knowledge, which is looked
upon as the instrument by which to take possession of the absolute, or as the
means through which to get a sight of it. The precaution seems legitimate,
partly because there are various kinds of knowledge, among which one
might be better adapted than another for the attainment of our purpose, ­
and thus a wrong choice is possible; and partly because knowing is a faculty
of a definite kind and with a determinate range, and so without the more
precise detennination of its nature and limits we might take hold on clouds
of error instead of the heaven of truth. This apprehensiveness is sure to pass
even into the conviction that the whole enterprise, which sets out to secure
for consciousness by means of knowledge the in-itself, is in its very nature
absurd; and that between knowledge and the absolute there lies a boundary
which completely cuts off the one from the other. For if knowledge is the
instrument by which to get possession of absolute essence, the suggestion
immediately occurs that the application of an instrument to anything docs

implicitly thought from the Event.

86

I I EG E L'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIE�CE

not leave it as it is for itself, but rather entails in the process and has in view
a molding and alteration of it. Or, again, if knowledge is not an instrument
which we actively employ, but a kind of passive medium through which the
light of the truth reaches us, then here, too, we do not receive it as it is in
itself, but as it is through and in this medium. In either case we employ a
means which immediately brings about the very opposite of its own end; or,
rather, the absurdity lies in making use of any means at all. It seems indeed
open to us to find in the knowledge of the way in which the instrument
operates, a remedy for this parlous state of affairs; for thereby it becomes
possible to remove from the result the part which, in our idea of the absolute
received through that instrument, belongs to the instrument, and thus to
get the truth in its purity. But this improvement would, as a matter of fact,
only bring us back to the point where we were before. If we take away again
from a definitely formed thing that which the instrument has done in the
shaping of it, then the thing (in this case the absolute) stands before us once
more just as it was previous to all this trouble, which, as we now sec, was
superfluous. If the absolute were only to be brought on the whole nearer
to us by this agency, without any change being wrought in it, like a bird
caught by a limestick, it would certainly scorn a trick of that sort, if it were
not, and did not intend to be, in and for itself with us from the start. For
a trick is what knowledge in such a case would be, since by all it'i busy toil
and trouble it gives itself the air of doing something quite different from
bringing about a relation that is merely immediate and so a waste of time to
establish. Or, again, if the examination of knowledge, which we represent
as a medium, makes us acquainted with the law of its refraction, it is likewise
useless to eliminate this refraction from the result. For knowledge is not the
divergence of the ray, but the ray itself by which the truth comes in contact
with us; and if this be removed, the bare direction or the empty place would
alone be indicated.
[2] Meanwhile, if the fear of falling into error introduces an element of
distrust into science, which without any scruples of that sort goes to work
and really docs know, it is not easy to understand why, conversely, a distrust
should not be placed in this very distrust, and why we should not take care
lest the fear of error is not just the initial error. A'i a matter of fact, this
fear presupposes something, indeed a great deal, as truth, and supports its
scruples and consequences on what shouJd·itsclf he examined beforehand
to sec whether it is truth. It starts with ideas of lmuwledge as an instrument,
and as a medium; and presupposes a distinction ofotmelvesfrom this knuw/edge.

OFF Ti l E B EATEN TRACK

More especially it takes for granted that the absolute stands on one side, and
that knowledge on the othe·r side, for itself and cut off from the absolute, is still
something real; in other words, that knowledge, which, by being outside
the absolute, is certainly also outside truth, is nevertheless true - a position
which, while calling itself fear of error, makes itself known rather as fear of
the truth.

[3 J This conclusion comes from the fact that the absolute alone is true or
that the true is alone absolute. It may he set aside by mai..;ng the distinction
that a knowledge which does not indeed know the absolute as science wants
to know it, is none the less true too; and that knowledge in general, though
it may possibly be incapable of grasping the absolute, can still be capable
of truth of another kind. But we shall sec as we proceed that random talk
like this leads in the long run to a confused distinction between the absolute
truth and a truth of some other sort, and that "absolute," "knowledge," and
so on, are words which presuppose a meaning that has first to be got at.
[4] With suchlike useless ideas and expressions about knowledge, as an
instrument to take hold of the absolute, or as a medium through which
we have a glimpse of truth, and so on (relations to which all these ideas
of a knowledge which is divided from the absolute and an absolute divided
from knowledge in the last resort lead), we need not concern ourselves.
Nor need we trouble about the evasive pretexts which the incapacity of
"science" creates out of the presupposition of such relations, in order at
once to be rid of the toil of science, and to assume the air of serious and
zealous effort about it. Instead of being troubled with giving answers to all
these, they may be straightway rejected as adventitious and arbitrary ideas;
and the use which is here made of words like "absolute," "knowledge," as
also "objective" and "subjective," and innumerable others, whose meaning
is assumed to be familiar to everyone, might well be regarded as so much
deception. For to pretend that their significance is universally familiar and
that everyone indeed possesses their concept, rather looks like an attempt to
dispense with the only important matter, which is just to give this concept.
With better right, on the contrary, we might spare ourselves the trouble
of taking any notice at all of such ideas and ways of talking which would
have the effect of warding off science altogether; for they make a mere
empty show of knowledge which at once vanishes when science comes on
the scene. But science, in the very fact that it comes on the scene, is itself a
phenomenon; its "coming on the scene" is not yet itselfcarried out in all the
length and breadth of it.'i truth. In this regard, it is a matter of indifference
88

H EG EL'S CONCEPT OF E X P E R I ENCE

whether we consider that it (science) is the phenomenon because it makes
its appearance

alongside another kind of knowledge, or call

that other untrue

knowledge its process of appearing. Science, however, must liberate itsel f
from this phenomenality, this seeming, and it can only do so by turning
against it. For science cannot simply reject a form of knowledge which is
not true, and treat this as a common view of things, and then assure us that
itself is an entirely different kind of knowledge, and that it holds the other
to be of no account at all; nor can it appeal to the fact that in this other
there are presages of a better. By giving that "assurance" it would declare its
force and value to lie in its bare existmce; but the untrue knowledge appeals
likewise to the fact that it is, and "assures" us that to it science is nothing.
One barren assurance, however, is of just as much value as another. Still less
can science appeal to the presages of a better, which are to be found present
in untrue knowledge and are there pointing the way toward science; for,
on the one hand, it would be appealing again in the same way to a merely
existent fact; and, on the other, it would be appealing to itself, to the way in
which it exists in untrue knowledge, i.e., to a bad form of its own existence,
to its appearance, rather than to how it is in and for itself. For this reason
we shall here undertake the presentation of knowledge as a phenomenon.
[5] Now because this presentation has for its object only phenomenal
knowledge, the presentation itself seems not to be science, free, self-moving
in the shape proper to itself, but may, from this point of view, be taken as the
pathway of natural consciousness which is pressing forward to true knowl­
edge. Or it

can

be regarded as the path of the soul, which is traversing the

series of its own forms of embodiment, like stages appointed for it by its
own nature, that it may possess the clearness of spirit when, through the
complete experience of its own self, it arrives at the knowledge of what it is
in itself.
[6] Natural consciousness will prove itself to be only the concept of knowl­
edge and not real knowledge. Since, however, it immediately takes itself to
be the real and genuine knowledge, this pathway has a negative significance
for it; what is a realization of the concept of knowledge means for it rather
the ruin and overthrow of itself; for on this road it loses its own truth.
Because of that, the road can be looked on as the path of doubt, or more
properly a highway of despair. For what happens there is not what is usually
understood by doubting, a jostling against i:his or that supposed truth, the
outcome of which is again a disappearance in due course of the doubt and
a return to the former truth, so that at the end the matter is taken as it

OFF T H E B EATEJ\' TRACK

was before. On the contrary, that pathway is the conscious insight into the
untruth of phenomenal knowledge, for which that is the most real which is
after all only the unrealized concept. On that account, too, this thorough­
going skepticism is not what doubtless earnest zeal for truth and science
fancies it has equipped itself with in order to be ready to deal with them ­
viz. the resolve, in science, not to deliver itself over to the thoughts of others
on their mere authority, but to examine everything for itself, and only follow
its own conviction, or, still better, to produce everything itself and hold only
its own act for true. The series of shapes, which consciousness traverses on
this road, is rather the detailed history of the j01?natio11 of con.'iciousness
itself up to the level of science. That resolve represents this mental devel­
opment in the simple fonn of an intended purpose, as immediately finished
and complete, as having taken place; this pathway, on the other hand, is, as
opposed to this abstract intention, or untruth, the actual carrying out of that
process of development. To follow one's own conviction is certainly more
than to hand oneself over to authority; hut by the conversion of opinion
held on authority into opinion held out of personal conviction, the content
of what is held is not necessarily altered, and truth has not thereby taken the
place of error. If we stick to a system of opinion and prejudice resting on the
authority of others, or upon personal conviction, the one differs from the
other merely in the conceit which animates the latter. Skepticism, directed
to the whole compass of phenomenal consciousness, on tl1e contrary, makes
spirit for the first time qualified to test what truth is; since it brings about
a despair regarding what arc called natural views, thoughts, and opinions,
which it is a matter of indifference

to

call personal or belonging to oiliers,

and with which ilie consciousness that proceeds immediately to criticize and
test is still filled and hampered, ilius being, as a matter of fact, incapable of
what it wants to undertake.

[ 7]

The

completmess of the

forms of unreal consciousness will be brought

about precisely through the necessity of the advance and the necessity of
their connection wiili one another. To make this comprehensible we may
remark, by way of preliminary, that the presentation of untrue consciousness
in its untruth is not a merely negative process. Such a one-sided view of it
is what the natural consciousness generally adopts; and a knowledge, which
makes this one-sidedness its essence, is one of those shapes assumed by
incomplete consciousness which falls into the course of the inquiry itself
and will come before us iliere. For this view is skepticism, which always
sees in the result only

pure 11othingness,

and it abstracts away the fact that

J I EGE L'S CO�CEPT OF E X P E R I E N C E

this nothing is specifically the nothing of tbat ollt ofwbich it c011u:s as a 1·emlt.
Nothing, however, is only, in fa<."t, the true result, when taken as the nothing
of what it comes from; it is thus itself a determinate nothing, and has a content.
The skepticism which ends with the abstraction "nothing" or "emptiness"
can advance from this not a step farther, but must wait and sec whether
there is possibly anything new offered, and what that is, - in order to cast
it into the same abysmal void. \Vhen once, on the other hand, the result is
apprehended, as it truly is, as detn711inate negation, a new fom1 has thereby
immediately arisen; and in the negation the transition is made by which the
progress through the complete succession of shapes comes about of itself.
[8] The goal, however, is fixed for knowledge just as necessarily as the suc­
cession in the process. The terminus is at that point where knowledge is
no longer compelled to go beyond it'ielf, where it finds its own self, and
the concept corresponds to the object and the object to the concept. The
progress toward this goal consequently is without a halt, and at no earlier
stage is satisfaction to be found. That which is confined to a life of nature
is unable of itself to go beyond its immediate existence; but by something
other than itself it is forced beyond that; and to be thus wrenched out of
its setting is its death. Consciousness, however, is for itself its own concept;
thereby it immediately transcends what is limited, and, since this latter be­
longs to it, consciousness transcends its own self. Along with the particular
there is at the same time set up the "beyond," even i f this were only, as
in spatial intuition, beside what is limited. Consciousness, therefore, suffers
this violence at its own hands; it destroys its own limited satisfaction. At
the feeling of this violence, anxiety for the truth may well withdraw, and
struggle to preserve for itself that which is in danger of being lost. But it can
find no rest. Should that anxious fearfulness wish to remain always in un­
thinking indolence, thought will agitate the thoughtlessness, its restlessness
will disturb that indolence. Or let it take its stand as a form of sentimen­
tality which assures us it finds everything good in its own kind, and this
assurance likewise will suffer violence at the hands of reason, which finds
something not good just because and in so far as it is a kind. Or, again, fear
of the truth may conceal itself from itself and others behind the pretext that
it is precisely burning zeal for the very truth which makes it so difficult,
nay impossible, to find any other truth except that of which alone vanity is
capable - that of being ever so much cleverer than any ideas, which one gets
from oneself or others, could make possible. This sort of conceit which un­
derstands how to belittle every truth and turn away from it back into ito;elf,

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

and gloats over this its own private understanding which always knows how
to dissipate every possible thought, and to find, instead of all the content,
merely the barren ego - this is a satisfaction which must be left to itself; for
it flees the universal and seeks only an isolated existence on its own account
[Fiirsichseyn].
[9] As the foregoing has been stated, provisionally and in general, con­
cerning the manner and the necessity of the process of the inquiry, it may
also be of further service to make some observations regarding the method
of cmrying this out. This presentation, viewed as a process of relating science
to phmumena/ knowledge, and as an i11quiry and critical examin11tion into the
reality of lmowit1g, does not seem able to he effected without some presup­
position which is laid down as an ultimate n-iterion. For an examination
consists in applying an accepted criterion, and, on the final agreement or
disagreement therewith of what is tested, deciding whether the latter is right
or wrong; and the criterion in general, and science as well (if science were
to he the criterion) is thereby accepted as the essmce or the i11-itself. But,
here, where science first appears on the scene, neither sdencc nor any sort
of criterion has justified it'iclf as the essence or the in-itself; and without
this no examination seems able to be instituted.
[ 10] This contradiction and the removal of it will become more definite if,
to begin with, we call to mind the abstract determinations of knowledge
and of truth as they are found in consciousness. Consciousness, we find,
distinguisbes from it'iclf something, to which at the same time it relates itself;
or, to use the current expression, there is something for consciousne.'is; and
the detenninate form of this process of relati11g, or of there being something
for a conscioUS11ess, is knowledge. But from this being for another we distin­
guish being in-itself, what is related to knowledge is likewise distinguished
from it, and posited as also existing outside this relation; the aspect of this
in-ito;elf is called h"1lth. What really lies in these detenninations does not
further concern us here; for since the object of our inquiry is phenomenal
knowledge, its determinations arc also taken up, in the first instance, as they
present themselves immediately to us. And they present themselves to us
very much in the way we have just stated.
[ I I ] If now our inquiry deals with the truth of knowledge, it appears that
we are inquiring what knowledge is in itself But in this inquiry knowledge
is our object, it isfor us; and the in-ito;elf of knowledge, were this to come to
light, would be rather ito; beingf01· us: what we should assert to be its essence

I I EGEI.'S COJ',;CEPT OF EXPERI E:-.lCE

would rather be not the truth of knowledge but only our knowledge of it.
The essence or the criterion would lie in us; and what was to he compared
with this criterion, and decided upon as a result of this comparison, would
not necessarily have to recognize that criterion.
[ 1 2] But the nature of the object which we are examining surmounts this
separation, or semblance of separation, and presupposition. Consciousness
furnishes its own criterion in it itself, and the inquiry will thereby be a
comparison of itself with its own self; for the distinction, just made, falls
inside itself. In consciousness there is one element.for an other, or, in general,
consciousness impl icates the specific character of the moment ofknowledge.
At the same time this "other" is to consciousness not merely for it, hut also
outside this relation, or has a being in itself, i.e., there is the moment of
truth. Thus in what consciousness inside itself declares to be the in-itselfor
true we have the criterion which it itself sets up, and by which we are to
measure its knowledge. Suppose we call /mow/edge "the concept," and the
essence or the true "the being that is" or "the object," then the examination
consists in seeing whether the concept corresponds with the object. But if
we call the essence, or the in-itself, of the object "the concept," and, on the
other side, understand by "object" the concept as object, i.e., the way the
concept isfor an other, then the examination consists in our seeing whether
the object corresponds to its own concept. It is clear, of course, that both
of these processes are the same. The essential fact, however, to be borne in
mind throughout the whole inquiry is that both these moments, concept and
object, "being for another" and "being in itself," themselves fall within that
knowledge which we are examining. Consequently we do not require to
bring criteria with us, nor to apply our fancies and thoughts in the inquiry;
and just by our leaving these aside we are enabled to consider the matter as
it actually is i11 itselfand for itself.

[ 1 3] But not only in this respect, that concept and object, the criterion
and what is to he critically examined, are ready to hand in consciousness
itself, is any contribution of ours superfluous, but we are also spared the
trouble of comparing these two and of making an e.wrminati011 in the strict
sense of the term; so that in this respect, too, since consciousness critically
examines itself, all we are left to do is purely to watch, to look on. For
consciousness is, on the one hand, consciousness of the object, on the other,
consciousness of itself; consciousness of what to it is true, and consciousness
of ito; knowledge of that truth. Since both are for the same consdousness, it is
itself their comparison; it is for the same conscioumess to decide and know
93

OFF

THF. B EATEN TRACK

whether its knowledge of the object corresponds with this object or not.
The object, it is true, appears only to be in such wise for consciousness as
consciousness knows it. Consciousness does not seem able to get, so to say,
behind it as it is, not for consciousness, but in itself, and consequently seems
also unable to test knowledge by it. But just because consciousness has, in
general, knowledge of an object, there is already present the distinction that
what the object is in itself, is one thing to consciousness, while knowledge, or
the being of the object for consciousness, is another moment. Upon this
distinction, which is present as a fact, the examination turns. Should both,
when thus compared, not correspond, consciousness seems bound to alter
its knowledge, in order to make it fit the object. But in the alteration of the
knowledge, the object itself also, in point of fact, is altered; for the knowledge
which existed was essentially a knowledge of the object; with change in the
knowledge, the object also becomes different, since it belonged essentially
to this knowledge. Hence consciousness comes to find that what formerly
to it was the in-itself is not in itself, or rather that it was in itself only for
consciousness. Since, then, in the case of its object consciousnes.'i finds its
knowledge not corresponding with this object, the object likewise fails to
hold out; or more precisely, the criterion for examining is altered when the
intended object of the criterion does not hold its ground in the course of the
examination; and the examination is not only an examination of knowledge,
but also of the criterion used in the process.
[ 14) This dialectical movement which consciousness executes on itself- on
it.o; knowledge as well as on its object - in the sense that out ofit the new and tme
object m·ises, is precisely what is termed experience. In this connection, there
is a moment in the process just mentioned which should be brought into
more decided prominence, and by which a new light is cast on the scientific
aspect of the following presentation. Consciousness knows something; this
something, the object, is the essence or the in-itself. This object, however, is
also the in-itselffor consciousness. Hence comes the ambiguity of this truth.
Consciousness, as we see, has now two object.'i: one is the first in-itself, the
second is the being-for-consciousness of this i11-itsel[. The last object appears
at first sight to be merely the reflection of consciousness into itself, i.e., an
idea not of an object, but solely of its knowledge of that first object. But,
as was already indicated, by that very process the first object is altered; it
ceases to be the in-itself, and becomes something which is in itself only fo1·
consciousness. Consequently, then, this being-for-consciousness of the in-itself is
the true - which, however, means that this true is the essence, or the object
94

HEGEL'S CONCEPT O F EXPF. RI EI\"CE

which consciousness has. This new object contains the nothingness of the
first; the new object is the experience concerning that first object.

[ 1 5] In this presentation of the course of experience, there is a moment
in virtue of which it does not seem to be in agreement with what is ordi­
narily understood by experience. The transition from the first object and
the knowledge of it to the other object, in regard to which we say we have
had experience, was so stated that the knowledge of the first object (the
fin·-consciousness of the first in-itself} is itself to become the second ob­
ject. But it usually seems that we learn by experience the untruth of our
first concept by appealing to some other object which we may happen to
find casually and externally; so that, in general, what we have is merely the
hare and simple apprehension of what is in and for itself. On the view above
given, however, the new object is seen to have come about by a revet-sal of
consciousness itself. This way of looking at the matter is our doing, what we
contribute; by its means the series of experiences through which conscious­
ness passes is li fted into a scientific route, but this does not exist for the
consciousness we contemplate. We have here, however, the same sort of
circumstance, again, of which we spoke a short time ago when dealing with
the relation of this presentation to skepticism, viz. that the result which at
any time comes about in the case of an untrue mode of knowledge cannot
possibly collapse into an empty nothing, but must necessarily be taken as
the negation ofthat ofwhich it is a result - a result which contains what truth
the preceding mode of knowledge has in it. What we have here is presented
to us in this fonn: since what at first appeared as object is reduced, when
it passes into consciousness, to a knowledge of the object, and since the
in-itselfbecomes a being-for-co'llsciousness of the i1z-itself, then as a result this
latter is the new object, whereupon there appears also a new shape or em­
bodiment of consciousness, the essence of which is something other than
that of the preceding shape. It is this circumstance which carries forward
the whole succession of the shapes of consciousness in their necessity. It is
only this necessity, or this origination of the new object (which offers itself
to consciousness without consciousness knowing how it comes by it), that
takes place for us, so to say, behind its back. In this way there enters into
the movement of consciousness a moment of the being in itselfor being for
us, which does not specifically present itself to consciousness which is in
the grip of experience itself. The content, however, of what we see arising
existsfor comciousness, and we lay hold of and comprehend merely its formal
character, i.e., its bare origination;for co11sciousness, what has thus arisen has
95

OI'F THE BEATEN TRACK

merely the character of object, while, for us, it appears at the same time as
movement and becoming.
In virtue ofthat necessity this pathway to science is itself already scie11Ce, and
is, moreover, as regards its content, science of the experirnce ofcoTISciousness.

[ 1 6] The experience which consciousness has concerning itself can , by its
own concept, conceive within itself nothing less than the entire system of
consciousness, the whole realm ofthe truth of spirit, and in such wise that the
moments of truth present themselves in the specific and peculiar character
they here possess - i.e., not as abstract pure moments, but as they are for
consciousness, or as consciousness itself appears in its relation to them, and
in virtue of which the moments of the whole are shapes or configtwations of
consciousness. In pressing forward to its true existence, consciousness will
come to a point at which it lays aside its semblance of being hampered with
what is foreign to it, with what is only for it and exists as an other; it will
reach a position where appearance becomes identified with essence, where,
in consequence, its presentation coincides with just this very point, this very
stage of the genuine science of spirit. And, finally, when it grasps this its
own essence, it will indicate the nature of absolute knowledge itself.
The first pnmgraph gives the subject matter of philosophy. "It contemplates
what is present as that which is present and (contemplates) therefore what is
already predominant in it (in what is present) on its own," 6ewpei -To ov � ov
Kai TCr TOUT� \rnapxoVTa Ka6' a\n6 (Aristotle, Metaphysics r I , I OOJ a2 I ).
Predominance concerns coming-to-light in unconcealedness. Philosophy
contemplates what is present in its presencing. Contemplation observes
[betmchtet] what is present. It strives [nvchtet] toward it so that it looks at
what is present only as such. Philosophy looks at (sieht 1111] what is present
in regard to its looks (A71Sehf11) . No hidden depth is simmering in the vi­
sion [Schau] of this contemplation [Beschauens]. 6ewpia makes all knowledge
sober. Philosophy, Hegel says in the language of his thought, is "the real
knowledge of what truly is." In the meantime, the beings that truly arc have
proved to be beings that are real, beings whose reality is spirit. The essence
of spirit, however, is based in self-consciousness.
In his lectures on the history of modem philosophy (Werkc, vol. XV,
p. 3 28'), after discussing Bacon and Jakob Bohrne, Hegel says:
It is only now that we do in fact arrive at the phi losophy of the modem world, and we
begi n it with Descartes. With him we actually enter upon an autonomous philosophy,
one that knows that its autonomy comes from reason and that self-consciousness is

I I EG EL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIENCE

the essential moment of truth . Here, we can say, we are at home, and like the mariner
after a long voyage on stonny seas, we can shout, "Land ho!" . . . The principle in
this new period is thinking, thinking which proceeds from itself.

Thinking seeks in the unshakeable certainty of what it has thought the

fondamC11t'll1n absolut11m for itself. The land

in which philosophy has subse­

quently made itself at home is the unconditional self-certainty of knowing.
The land has been conquered and fully surveyed only gradually. Full pos­
session is attained only when the fundmnentum

absoluttmt is thought as the

absolute ito;clf. For Hegel, the absolute is spirit: that which is present to itself

[bei sich]

in the certainty of unconditional self-knowing. Real knowledge of

beings as beings now becomes the absolute knowledge of the absolute in its
absoluteness.
I lowever, this philosophy of the modem age, dweller in the land of self­

consciousness, demands of itself (in keeping with the climate of this land)
that it have a prior certainty of its principle. It intends to come to a prior
understanding about the mode of knowing in which it knows absolutely.
Unexpectedly, knowledge thus appears as a means about whose proper em­
ployment knowledge must be apprehensive. It is essential, on the one hand,
to recognize and to select among the diverse modes of representation that
mode which alone is suitable for absolute knowledge. This was Descartes'
task. On the other hand, once the suitable knowledge of the absolute has
been selected, it must be gauged with respect to its nature and its limits.
This was Kant's task. Yet as soon as knowledge - as a means to take pos­
session of the absolute - is taken to task, the conviction immediately arises
that, in relation to the absolute, every means (which, as a means, is relative)
is unsuited to the absolute and necessarily fails before it. If knowledge is
a means, then every intention to know the absolute is an absurd project,
whether the means asswnes in this case the character of an ins trum ent or
a medium. In the one case we actively busy ourselves with knowledge as
an instrument, in the other we passively suffer knowledge as the medium
through which the light of truth is supposed to reach us.
We could still try to remedy this unfortunate state of affairs (in which
the means is precisely not mediating) through an examination of the means,
distinguishing what it alters about the absolute and what it leaves unaltered,
when it grasps the absolute or lets it pass. However, when we subtract
the alteration that was caused by the means, and therefore do not apply
the means, it also does not mediate to us the remainder of the unaltered
absolute. Fundamentally, the examination of the means docs not know what

97

OFF T H E B EATE :'II TRACK

it is doing. It must judge

[Angemessenheit]

[messm] knowledge, as regards its appropriateness

to the absolute, by means of the absolute. It must have

known the absolute all along, and in fact known it as the absolute, or else all
critical demarcations of limits turn out to he empty. Moreover, something
else comes to light: the fact that discussing the instrument matters more to
the examination than knowing the absolute. However, even if the instrument
mattered to knowledge as the only means to bring the absolute any closer
to us, the project would still be bound to fail risihly in the face of the
absolute. What is the point of all this critical activity regarding knowledge if
right from the start knowledge is going to wriggle free from the immediate
relationship of the absolute to the knower, on the grounds that it must
first clear up the business of criticism? Contrary to its better immediate
knowledge, the critical examination of the instrument does not turn ito;
attention to the absolute. The absolute, moreover, does not scorn critical
toiling; for to do this it would have to share with criticism the assumption
that knowledge is a means and that it itself, the absolute, is far enough
removed from knowledge to oblige it to exert itself before capturing the
absolute. But in this case the absolute would not be the absolute.
It is only in passing, however, and by relegating it to a subordinate clause,
that Hegel makes this remark: the absolute is from the start in and for it.o; e)f
with us and intends to be with us. This being-with-us

(napoucrla) is in itself

already the mode in which the light of truth, the absolute itself, beams

[anstrahlt)

upon us. To know the absolute is to stand in the ray

light, to give it back, to radiate

[mr�hlt]

[Strahl]

of

it back, and thus to be itself in its

essence the ray, no mere medium through which the ray must first find its
way. The first step which knowledge of the absolute must take is simply to
accept and to take

[bin- und aufounebmen]

the absolute in its absoluteness,

i.e., in its being-with-us. This presencing-with-us, parousia, is characteristic
of the absolute in and for itself. When philosophy as knowledge of the
absolute takes seriously what it is as such knowledge, then it is by that fact
alone the real knowledge that represents what real beings themselves are
in their truth. In the beginning and in the course of the first paragraph it
appears as though Hegel were trying to meet the critical demands by natural
representation for a test of knowledge. In truth, what matters to him is to
indicate the absolute in its parousia among us. All that happens as a result is
that we are directed specifically into that relationship with the absolute in
which we already are. In this way Hegel seems to surrender all the critical
achievements of modem philosophy. So is he not dismissing, in general, all
of critical examination in favor of backsliding into arbitrary assertions and

H EG EL'S CO:'ISCEPT OF EXPER!El'\CE

assumptions? Not at all. I legel is the first to prepare a critical examination.
The first step in its preparation consists in our abandoning the usual idea of
knowledge. However, if knowledge is not a means, then examination also
can no longer consist in appraising knowledge first of all on the basis of
its suitability to mediate. Perhaps it is already a sufficient examination for
us to observe what knowledge is when it cannot he a means a priori. Not
only what is to he examined, but the examination itself, shows a different
nature.

The second paragraph touches on the core of the criticism to which science
has subjected all previous philosophical critiques of knowledge. In all his
following paragraphs, Hegel no longer uses the word "philosophy." He
speaks of science. For in the meantime, modern philosophy has attained
to the perfection of its nature; the terrd firnta on which it set foot for the
first time has now been fully taken into its possession. The land is the self­
certainty of representation in respect to itself and what it represents. To
take this land fully into possession means: to know the self-certainty of self­
consciousness in ito; unconditional essence and to be in this knowledge as
in knowledge par excellence.a Philosophy is now unconditional knowledge
within the knowledge of self-certainty. In knowledge as such, philosophy
has made itself fully at home. The whole essence of philosophy is consti­
tuted by the unconditional self-knowing of knowledge. Philosophy is the
science. This tenn does not imply that philosophy adopted a model from
the other sciences that were available and fully realized it in an ideal. When,
within an absolute metaphysics, the tenn "science" takes the place of the
tenn "philosophy," it takes its meaning from the essence of the subject's
self-certainty which knows itself unconditionally. This subject is now that
which truly (which now means "certainly") lies before us, the S7tbiectu11l,
the vrroKeiJJevov, which philosophy since antiquity has had to recognize as
that which presences. Philosophy has become science because it has re­
mained philosophy. Its responsibility is to contemplate beings as beings.
Since Leibniz, however, beings have appeared for thinking in such a man­
ner that every e71S qtta ens is a res cogitans and in this sense is a subject. That
this is so is not because of some thinker's opinion but is due to the being
of beings. The subject, needless to say, is not subjective in the sense of an
egotism intent on itself. The subject has it'i essence in a representational
relation to the object. However, as this r:elation, it is already a relation of

that they are in the mode of the unconditional self-knowing of knowledge.
For this reason, the presentation that represent<; these beings as beings,
philosophy, is itself science.
As the subjectity of the subject, unconditional self-knowing is the abso­

luteness of the absolute. Philosophy is absolute knowledge. Philosophy is
science because it wills the will of the absolute, i.e., the absolute in its ab­
soluteness. Thus willing, it intends to contemplate beings as beings. Thus
willing, philosophy wills its essence. Philosophy is science, the science. In
the last sentence, "is" docs not mean that philosophy bears along with it­
self, as a predicate, some definite quality of being scientific; rather it means:
philosophy

is as absolute knowledge and

is only as it is that it may belong

with the absoluteness of the absolute, achieving absoluteness in its own way.
Philosophy as absolute knowledge is science, but this is by no means a con­
sequence of striving to make its procedure exact and its results conclusive
- thereby making it'iclf equal to that which, in essence and rank, is beneath
it: scientific research.
Philosophy is science because, knowing absolutely, it remains at its work.
To it "scruples of that sort" - scruples which critical reductions have brought
to bear on knowledge in the past - are foreign. Hegel carefully (mit Bedacht]
says "scruples

[Bedenklichkeitm)

of that sort." He is not maintaining that

philosophy may go to work unscrupulously

[bedenken/os] and throw critical

examination to the winds. Absolute knowledge is, on the contrary, more
thoughtful

[bedenkmder] about knowing the absolute than the apprehensive
1 00

H EG EL'S CO:'I/C EPT OF EX P E R I E:'\CE

[bedenkliche) kind of criticism has hitherto ever been able to be. The cur­
rent critical fear about knowing the absolute indeed dreads error. How­
ever, only within a particular relation could it even commit error, a relation
that had unhesitatingly [bedenkenlos) been presupposed to be true, a rela­
tion within which knowledge, taken as a means, becomes error itself. This
fear of error, which looked like critical examination, is itself error. In what
way?
As soon as knowledge is taken as a means (instrument or means) - how
long has it been taken in this way, and why? - it is considered to be something
that come.'i forth on its own rfiir sich] between the absolute and those who
know it. Knowledge exists cut off from the absolute, but also from us who
handle knowledge. Totally cut off from each other in this way, the absolute
stands on the one side and those who know it stand on the other side. Yet
what is an absolute that stands on one side? What kind of absolute stands
on any side at all? Whatever it is it is not the absolute.
At the same time, reductive criticism takes knowledge to be something
real, or even what is primarily and nonnatively real. Therefore it appeals to
something true, which means something that is certain even for criticism,
something whose certainty, however, is supposed still to exist though cut
off from the unconditional self-certainty of everything that is certain. This
ens n·eatum in the sense of the ego cogito is supposed to be certain without
the absolute, as the rns certum; however, it'i certainty is retrospectively se­
cured through the backdoor, by means of a proof of God's existence; this
was already the case in Descartes. Critical concern, it is true, intends to
arrive at something absolute, but it would like to manage it without the
absolute. It even seems that this concern may be thinking in a way suited
to the absolute when it provisionally banishes the absolute to the realm of
the inaccessible, thereby seemingly putting it as high as possible. Criticism,
however, though supposedly apprehensive about the high esteem of the
absolute, underestimates the absolute. It drags the absolute down into the
narrowness of its doubts and its means. Criticism tries to drive the abso­
lute out of its parousia, as though the absoluteness of the absolute could
be introduced at some subsequent moment. The apparently critical fear of
making an overhasty error is the uncritical evasion of the truth which has
already begun its stay. When, on the other hand, science carries out and
specifil:ally accepts its own essence, then it has already examined itself. Part
of this examination is to know that science· as absolute knowledge stands in
the parousia of the absolute. But all this is based on the content of the next
paragraph.
101

OFF T i l E H EATEI'\' TRACK

1'l1e thirdparagraph states: the absolute, uniquely, is true. The true, uniquely,
is absolute. The propositions are posited without grounds. They cannot be
grounded because no grounding reaches into their ground. No grounding
ever reaches their ground because grounding, as the will to ground, con­
stantly moves away from their ground. The propositions are ungrounded
but not arbitrary in the sense of a gratuitous assertion. The propositions are
ungroundable. They have posited that which grounds in the first place. In
them, there speaks the will of the absolute, which in and for itself wills to
be already with us.
Since modem philosophy set foot on its terra finna, truth has prevailed
as certainty. The true is that which is known in the unconditional self­
knowledge of the self. Previously, truth was taken as the correspondence
of representation with beings. It is one property of representation. As cer­
tainty [Gewirsheit], however, truth now becomes representation [ Vorstellen]
itself since it hands [zustellt] itself over to itself and makes itself certain of
itself as representation. Knownness [Gewussheit], which has made itself cer­
tain of its knowledge (and, in fact, has done so before itself and with itself),
has thereby also withdrawn itself from any particularized representation of
objects. It no longer fastens to objects in order to have what is true by means
of this fastening to them. Knowledge becomes uncoupled from the relation
to objects. The representation that knows itself as a handing over detaches
itself (nbsolve7·e) from the search to find its sufficient certainty within a one­
sided representation of objects. The detachment pennits this representation
to continue to exist in such a way that it no longer clings exclusively to its
object. This self-uncoupling of self-certainty from an objective relation is
its absolvence. It is characteristic of absolvence to affect any relation that
applies only in a direct way to the object. Absolvence is only absolvence
to the extent that it is completed in every respect, i.e., entirely absolved.
In the absolving of its absolvence, the self-certainty of representation at­
tains to certainty, which, for it, means that it attains to the free space of
its essence. It acquits itself of its one-sided connection to objects and of its
mere representation of them. Unconditional self-certainty is, therefore, its
own self-absolution. The unity of absolvence (uncoupling from relation),
absolving (completeness of uncoupling), and absolution (acquittal on the
basis of that completeness) characterize the absoluteness of the absolute.
All these moments of absoluteness have the character of representation. In
them there essences the parousia of the absolute. The true in the sense of
unconditional self-certainty is, uniquely, the absolute. The absoluteness of
self-representation, as we have characterized it here, is, uniquely, the true.
1 02

I I EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPER I EJ\:CE

And yet, despite any explanation, however extended, these propositions
remain empty. Explanations even promote misunderstanding; for what
those sentences give is the phenomenology of spirit - which is in its presen­
tation. That is why Hegel is content to offer the propositions tout court and
risk every appearance of willfulness. However, the reason he states them is
to make us ready for what science as absolute knowledge wills. In its own
manner, science wills only what the absolute wills. The will of the absolute
is, in and for itself, to be already with us. Now that means: since the abso­
lute is willing in this way, only the absolutely true is with us, when we arc
the ones who know the absolute. Therefore, anyone who is still claiming
that besides absolute knowledge (which philosophy arrogates to itself in
its uncritical way) other truths also exist does not know what he is talking
about. As soon as he adduces something true, he has already represented
the absolute. As long as the seemingly cautious and prudent distinction is
maintained between an absolute truth and some other truth, we are loitering
in a confused distinction. In fact, we have already turned this confusion into
the principle of criticism and the decisive norm for science. And yet it is the
responsibility of science alone to get at what these words mean: absolute,
knowledge, true, objective, subjective. This requires, however, that with its
first step science already reaches into the parousia of the absolute, i.e., is
with the absoluteness of the absolute. Otherwise it would not be science. If
this is the case, it is an offense against its nature for science to engage at all
with considerations that arc outside the realm of truth and beneath its own
level. However, even if science keeps itself clear of critical considerations
unsuited to it, it will still remain under the suspicion that though it indeed
asserts itself absolutely as absolute knowledge, it docs not prove itself to
be such. It therefore offends most bitterly against the claim of certainty,
the pure fulfillment of which it claims to be. Science must, therefore, be
brought before the forum which alone is competent to decide how it is to be
examined. This forum can only be the parousia of the absolute. Therefore,
it is of renewed importance to clarify the absoluteness of the absolute.

Thefourth pa7'0gmph indicates what is required of us, as those who know, by
the will prevailing in the parousia of the absolute, the will to be, in and of
itself, with us. Current criticism of philosophical knowledge unquestion­
ingly takes such knowledge to be a means. It thereby gives proof that it
neither knows absolute knowledge nor is ·capable of achieving it. The in­
capacity to perceive and to accept the parousia of the absolute before aU
else is the incapacity for science. The overzealous efforts related to doubts

1 03

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

and examinations evade the toils which science exerts to be engaged with
this acceptance. The absolute docs not grant us the step into the parousia
of the absolute in our sleep. That this step is strangely difficult is not at all
be(:ause we first have to arrive at the parousia from somewhere outside it, as
people think; rather, it is a matter, from within the parousia and therefore
from out of the parousia, of bringing forth our relationship to it before it.
That is why the toil of science is not limited to the labor which the knower,
doggedly persisting, expends on that step. The toil of science stems rather
from its relation to the parousia.
The absoluteness of the absolute, the absolution that absolves itself ab­
solvendy, is the labor of self-comprehension by unconditional self-certainty.
It is the painful strain to endure being tom to pieces; this is how the in­
finite relation

is in which the essence of the absolute is fulfilled. Once, early

in his career, Hegel made this note: "A mended sock is better than a torn
one, but not so for self-consciousness."3 When Hegel speaks of the labor
of the concept, he docs not mean the sweat of cerebral exertions by schol­
ars, but the self-wresting by the absolute itself into the absoluteness of its
self-comprehending on the basis of unconditional self-certainty. The ef­
fortlessness that characterizes the parousia (as the relation of being present
among us) can nonetheless be reconciled with efforts of this kind by the ab­
solute. The absolute, simply as the absolute, is involved in this relationship.
The toil within the absolute to bring about the presence of the absolute and
to make it appear in this presence corresponds to the toil of science. On the
basis of the straining of the one, the exertions of the other arc detennined.
In comparison, the zealous busde of critical examination neglects the most
difficult aspect of science's toil: to bear in mind that the knowledge that is to
he critically examined is absolute knowledge, i.e., philosophy. The normal
activities of the usual criticisms in regard to philosophical knowledge are
equivalent to the procedure of someone who intends to represent an oak
but takes no notice that it is a tree.
It might be tempting, therefore, to consider this critical conduct - which
pretends to examine something without even having first presented it to
itself for examination - to be a deception. It gives the impression of already
having the essential concepts while actually everything depends on giving
the concepts of the absolute, knowledge, the true, the objective and subjec­
tive, in the first place. The concern of criticism is not at all focused on the
subject which it is continually talking about. This kind of examining is an
"empty show of knowledge." What would it he like if science spared itself
the trouble of a confrontation with such criticism, seeing that it needs all

I I EGEL'S COJ',;CEPT OF EXPERIF.NCE

its efforts in order to maintain itself in its essence? What would it be like
if science were content simply to come on the scene without any critical
preliminaries? Yet it is here, in the middle of the paragraph, that Hegel
inserts his decisive "But":
"But science, in the very fact that it comes on the scene, is itself a phe­
nomenon." Science emerges, as other knowledges also do. Of course it can
assure us that it is the absolute knowledge before which all other ideas must
vanish. However, by putting on such airs, it makes itself every bit as common
as the empty shows of knowledge. Those empty shows can aver that they
too arc present. One assurance is as barren as the other. Mere assurance will
never get the living sap of real knowing to flow. However, science might
possibly he contrasted in other ways with mere shows of knowledge. It
might allude to the fact that it itself is that knowledge which untrue lmowl­
edge, without !mowing it, is seeking in it'ielf. Science could come on the
scene as that truth which is presaged in the untrue. Yet in so doing science
would again lapse into mere assurances. Besides, it would then be appeal­
ing to a mode of arrival that would ill become it as absolute lmowledge.
The merely presaged truth is far removed from being the truth in and for
itself.
What happens when science comes on the scene? It must make its ap­
pearance when it comes on. However, the question will be raised about what
that appearing is in which science alone can appear. To appear means in the
first place: to emerge alongside others in the mode of self-assertion. Fur­
thermore, to appear means: to happen, to come about and in this coming
about to point to something else that docs not yet come forth. 1<> appear
means: to be the light in which something comes to light, something which
itself neither appeared in the past nor will ever appear in the future. These
modes of appearance remain unsuited to how science comes onto the scene;
for within those modes it can never extend itself as itself and therefore can­
not fully set itself up. On the other hand, neither can science arrive all at
once as absolute knowledge. It must bring itself forth into its truth, hut it
must also bring its truth forth along with itself. In every phase in which
science comes forth, it is what issues forth as the absolute; and it issues forth
absolutely. The son of appearing that is suited to science can therefore only
consist in its presenting itself [darstellt] in the way it brings itself about and
thus set'i itself up [atifftellt] as !mowledge that is a phenomenon. Science may
come on the scene only by accomplishing the presentation of knowledge as
phenomenon. In this way there must arise - as here only it can arise - what
that appearance is in which science truly comes on the scene as itself.
1 05

OFF T H E B EATEN TRACK

In it'i appearance science represents itself in the fullness of its essence.
The empty shows of knowledge do not disappear by being rejected or just
ignored. The knowledge that only appears, that is only a phenomenon, is
not supposed to disappear at all, but rather to enter into its appearance. In
this way it appears as untrue knowledge, i.e., the not yet true knowledge
within the truth of absolute knowledge. In the appearance by which science
brings itself forth, the presentation of knowledge as phenomenon must
tum

against the semblance

(Anschein)

of knowledge; but it must do so in a

conciliatory manner, which even in mere seeming
shining

[Schein]

makes the pure

(Scheinen) of the ray of light to gleam. If, however, we dismiss mere

seeming simply as falsehood, then we have not yet perceived it even in its
seeming. At any rate, the unfolding entrance of science is never based on
its merely overcoming seeming. If that were the case, the true would be
acknowledging the suzerainty of the untrue. The phenomenon of science
has its necessity in that shining which even semblance requires in order to
be mere seeming.
Hegel's sentence "But science, in the very fact that it comes on the scene,
is itself a phenomenon" is ambiguously expressed, deliberately and with a
lofty intention. Science is not only a phenomenon in the sense that the
empty shows of untrue knowledge are also a phenomenon - by showing
themselves at all. Science, rather, is in itself already a phenomenon in the
single sense that it, as absolute knowledge, is the ray of light as which the
absolute, the light of truth itself, shines upon us. To appear by means of
this shining ray signifies: presencing in the full gleam of self-presenting
representation. Appearance is genuine presencing itself: the parousia of the
absolute. In keeping with its absoluteness, the absolute is with us on its own.
In its will to he with us, the absolute is presencing, becoming-present. By
thus bringing itself within itself to itself, it is for itself. It is for the sake of
the parousia alone that the presentation of knowledge as phenomenon is
necessary. The presentation is compelled to remain turned toward the will
of the absolute. The presentation is itself a willing, i.e., not a wishing and a
striving, but activity itself as it collects itself into its essence. The moment
that we recognize this necessity, we must reflect on what this presentation
is in order to know in what way it is, that we may be capable of being in the
way that it is, i.e., of carrying it out.

The fifth pamgraph

launches this reflection. In presenting phenomenal

knowledge, science must itself - through this presentation and through­
out the course of it - come fully to appearance. That is, it does not come

1 06

H EG E L ' S CONCEPT OF EXPER I E I' C E

crashing somewhere onto the scene. It makes its entry by proving itself at
every step to be what it is. On what stage does this proving take place?
Where else but before the eyes of natural representation? At every step
this representation follows the appearance of lmowledge across the diver­
sity of its phenomena and so is in pursuit from waystation to waystation as
merely phenomenal knowledge puts aside its seeming and finally presents
itself as true knowledge. The presentation of merely phenomenal knowl­
edge escorts natural representation through the outer court of knowledge
up to the door leading to absolute knowledge. The presentation of merely
phenomenal knowledge is the path of natural consciousness to science.
Since the appearances belonging to untruth have increasingly dropped away

en route, the path is the path of the soul toward possessing clearness of spirit.
The presentation of merely phenomenal knowledge is an itinerm"ium mentis
in Deum.4
What can be more welcome to natural consciousness and more useful
for philosophy than the description of the journey on this path? Because the
path to be described runs along the phenomena, it is a path of experience. All
kinds of knowledge ought to prefer an empiricism that follows data to mere
construction and deduction. The presentation of phenomenal knowledge,
phenomenology, keeps to the phenomena. It goes the way of experience.
Step by step, it escorts natural representation into the realm of the science
of philosophy.
These are indeed the circumstances of the presentation of phenomenal
knowledge if we observe the presentation with the eyes of natural represen­
tation, which always remains occupied with what, in its opinion, it has before
itself at a given time. But can a relative opinion ever catch sight of absolute
knowledge. No. What repre.'ients itself to natural consciousness under the
name of merely phenomenal knowledge and claiming to be the first knowl­
edge that leads to the true is a mere semblance. I lowever, in the opinion
of philosophy even today, the phenomenology of spirit is an

itinerarium, a

description of a journey, which is escorted by everyday consciousness to­
ward the scientific knowledge of philosophy. Yet what the phenomenology
of spirit, conceived ofin this way, appears to be is not what it is in its essence.
This appearance, however, is not deceptive by chance. It is a consequence
of the essence of the phenomenology of spirit; it forces itself before that

essence and conceals it. The appearance, taken in itself, leads us astray. Nat­

ural representation, which has here insinuated itself into philosophy, takes
phenomenal knowledge only as phenomenal; behind it a non-phenomenal,
a non-appearing, knowledge keeps itselfhidden. However, this presentation

1 07

OFF T i l E H EATEJI.: TRACK

is not at all the presentation of merely phenomenal knowledge as distinct
from a true knowledge to which this presentation is supposed to be the
first to lead us. On the contrary, the presentation is only the presentation
of phenomenal knowledge in its appearing. This "only" does not say that
the presentation is not yet science, but it does say that it is not yet science
in every respect. The appearing of phenomenal knowledge is the truth of
knowledge. The presentation of phenomenal knowledge in its appearing
is itself science. The moment the presentation begins it is already science.
l legel writes: "N'ow because this presentation has for its object only phe­
nomenal knowledge, the presentation itself seems not to be science . . . but
may . . . be taken . . . " I legel neither speaks of a knowledge that is merely
phenomenal, nor says that the presentation is only in the process of evolv­
ing into science, nor claims that the presentation may only be understood
as an

iti11erariu111 if it is to be grasped

in its essence.

The presentation, however, is by no means the guide of natural repre­
sentation through the museum of the shapes of consciousness, so that at
the end of the tour it is to be admitted through a special door into absolute
knowledge. On the contrary, with its first step if not before, the presentation
dismisses natural consciousness as constitutionally incapable of following
the presentation. The presentation of phenomenal knowledge is not a route
which natural consciousness can take. Nor, however, is it a path that at each
step gains distance from natural consciousness in order to meet up with
absolute knowledge somewhere in its subsequent course. Nonetheless, the
presentation is a path. Nonetheless, it moves hack and forth constantly in
the interstice that obtains between natural consciousness and science.

The si-rth paragraph

begins to mark out the path of the presentation and

to clarify the interstice within which the presentation necessarily moves in
making phenomenal knowledge appear as a phenomenon. Accordingly, the
paragraph begins with a distinction that will resurface from paragraph to
paragraph in diverse aspects, though all the while it will remain hidden to
what extent those aspects belong together and what constinnes the ground
of their unity. We must first of all focus our attention on the distinction
between natural consciousness and real knowledge.
Hegel uses the words "consciousness

[Bewum-sein]"

and "knowledge

(Wzssen ]" for the same thing. The one explains the other. Consciousness,
being-conscious

[Bewtt.at-sein] means: to be in a state of knowledge. Knowl­

edge itself delivers, presents, and determines in this way the mode of the
"being" in "being-conscious." In such a state there are, above all, that which
1 08

H EG EL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERI E!'l'CE

is known (i.e., that which the knower represents directly) and the represen­
ter, along with representing as how he behaves. To know, however, means

vidi, I have seen, I have taken a view [Ansicht] of something, a look [Einsicht]
into something. The perfect tense "I have seen" is the present tense "I
know," in the presence of which that which has been seen is present.S See­
ing is thought of here as having something before oneself in representation.
Representation presents, no matter whether what is present is perceived
by the senses or is something thought, or willed, or felt, apart from the
senses.

'lo represent is to catch sight of in advance, to hold in sight what

has been seen; it is

idea, but in the sense of the perceptio. Peruptio occu­
pies itself [ nimmt sich vor] with each thing that is present as such a thing,
deals with [nimmt durch] it, scrutinizes and secures it. Representing prevails

in all the modes of consciousness. It is neither a mere sensory apprehen­
sion nor yet a thought in the sense of a conceptual judgment. Representing
gathers together

(co-agitat)

in advance into a have-seen. In the gathering,

what has been caught sight of presences.

Conscientia

is the gathering into

that presence which is present through representation. As the mode of hav­
ing caught sight of something, representing brings the sight, the image,
into presence. Representing is the in-bringing

[Ei11bringm]

of the image

[BildJ, an in-bringing that prevails in knowledge as having-seen: imagination
[Ei11bildung]. Consciousness, to be conscious, means: to come to presence
in bringing-to-pass [Zuln'i11gen] out of representedness. Such is the mode
in which what has already been represented and the represcnter along with
his representing exist and exist together as closely related.
Consciousness, being-conscious, refers to a kind of being. However, this
"being-" must not remain a mere empty sound for us. It says: presencing in
the mode of the gathering of what has been caught sight of. And yet, in accor­
dance with a usage that has long been customary, the "being-" we have just
used means at the same time the beings themselves that arc in this mode. The
other name for beings that are in the mode of knowledge is "subject": that
which everywhere is already lying before us, presencing, and hence accom­
panies all consciousness: the representer himself in his representing which

into an unconcealedness: to come to presence, to be present, there. Con­
sciousness as such is that which appears in itself. 1<> be immediately present

that the place where something appears is formed as the stage on which it ap­

the rubric "the presentation of phenomenal knowledge" means. It does not
mean the presentation of that which only emerges at first in mere semblance.
It has one meaning alone: to represent, in its appearing, the knowledge that
in its immediacy is nothing other than that which appears. In addition to
representing phenomenal knowledge, the presentation represents the con­
sciousness that is as it is, i.e., it represents it as the effective, real knowledge.
The reality of this real knowledge, the subjectity of the subject, is appear­
ance itself. The being of this being (i.e., appearance), however, like all the
being of all beings in all metaphysics, enters into representation only when
beings present themselves as beings

But now the

1!11S perceptum. It presences in presentation through the

conscimtia. It is now the subject as subject that is to be presented,

and the phenomenal as the phenomenal. The presentation of phenomenal
knowledge is the ontology of real consciousness as real.
Presentation is a path, but it does not traverse the distance from pre­
philosophical representation to philosophy. Philosophy itself is this path, as
the course of representation that presents. The movement of this represen­
tation must be determined on the basis of that which presentation follows:
on the basis of phenomenal consciousness as such, i.e., of the real knowledge
which is the truth of natural knowledge.
Hence I iegel must begin his characterization of the essence of presenta­
tion with a sentence that throws into relief real knowledge as such. "Natural
consciousness will prove itself to be only the concept of knowledge and not
real knowledge."
Natural knowledge is contrasted with real. Therefore, the natural is not
the real and the real not natural. One might think that both arc the same.
The natural is what comes from nature, belongs to it, and corresponds to
it. Nature is the being that is itself without effort. Yet this effortless being is
supposed not to be what is real, by which is understood the effectively real,
which is nothing but beings themselves, nature? Hegel employs the distinc­
tion between natural and real in relation to that knowledge or consciousness
which, in itself, is what appears. The subject presences in the mode of ap­
pearance; with it, simultaneously and in its reference to the subject, the

I IO

I I E C ; EL'S CONCEPT OF EX PERI E:'I!CE

object presences. The phenomenal subject (i.e., the subject that appears) is
the knowledge that presences, is natural consciousness. However, accord­
ing to Hegel's sentence, natural consciousness proves itself to be something
that is not real knowledge. �atural consciousness even proves itself to be
"only the concept of knowledge." One might think that Hegel thinks that
nature is a mere concept and so not at all real. One might think that, con­
fronted with this evaporation of nature into a mere abstraction, it would be
essential to invest nature with its rights as the real. Hegel, however, docs
not deny that nature is something real, yet he demonstrates that it cannot
be reality, the being of beings. In no way does he claim that nature is only a
concept. He docs say: natural consciousness will prove itself to be "only the
concept of knowledge and not real knowledge." What "only the concept of
knowledge" means here will be detennined only on the basis of what Hegel
is thinking with the expression "real knowledge."
The real is that which truly is. Since Descartes, the true, the
is the

ens certtmt:

ens

verum,

that which knows itself in certainty, which presences in

knowledge. However, the

ens certtnn

qua ens. This occurs when the

e.rse of the ens is specifically represented, and

a being in its being, the real in its reality, is known. Real knowledge is the
knowledge that represents, always and everywhere, beings in their beingncss
(reality), phenomena in their appearing. The knowledge of the reality of the
real is therefore known as real knowledge. \Vhen natural knowledge proves
itself not to be real knowledge, this means: it turns out to be [stellt .rich
bemus] that knowledge which everywhere fails to represent fvorstellt] beings
as such but rather in its representation only fastens on beings. As it seek.'i
beings in their truth, it always attempts to explain beings on the basis of
beings. The beings in which consciousness is engrossed

[aufgeht]

are all

that it is cognizant of [atifgeht] and therefore all that it takes to he natural.
Such representation itself becomes engrossed in the beings it is cognizant
of and thus remains surrounded by them; that is why this knowledge is
natural knowledge. Yet this representation itself can become absorbed in
beings themselves and take everything everywhere to be beings only if it
already has, unknowingly, a representation in general of the beingness of
beings. Intrinsically and necessarily, the natural representation of beings is
this general representation of the beingness of beings - a representation,
however, that has no specific knowledge of the beingness of beings, the
reality of the real. In its representation df beings, natural consciousness
docs not attend to being; nonetheless, it must do so. It cannot help but
participate in the representation of the being of beings in general because
I l l

OFF T H E B EATEr\ TRACK

without the light ofbeing it cannot even be lost amidst beings. In this respect,
nantral consciousness is only the representation of beingness generally and
indetemtinately: "only the concept of knowledge," not the knowledge that
is certain of the reality of the real.
In this passage, Hegel uses the word "concept" in its traditional meaning
in accordance with the precepts of logic that define the fonns and rules of
natural thinking. A concept is the representation of something in general;
"only the concept" means that this representation docs not even specifi­
cally grasp what it represents. It is characteristic of natural consciousness,
however, not only to be constantly engrossed in the beings it represents but
also to take these beings as uniquely true and therefore to take its knowl­
edge as the real knowledge. This is why Hegel continues as follows: "Since,
however, it (natural consciousness) inunediately takes itself to be the real
and genuine knowledge, this pathway (that is, the path of presenting phe­
nomenal knowledge in its appearance) has a negative significance for it . . . "
Whenever real lmowledge places the being of beings in fuU light, natural
knowledge pays no attention to it because its own truth is thereby contested.
Natural knowledge holds to its own. Everything that occurs to it can be ex­
pressed as follows: it is and remains mine [das Meine] and is a being as this
thing that I meant

[als dieses Ge-meinte]. In understanding representation as
opinion [Meinen], Hegel detects in "opinion [meinen]" several related mean­
ings: "meinen" as being directed, without mediation, toward . ; "meinen" as
the trusting acceptance ofwhat is given; and "meinen" in the sense of keeping
and claiming something as one's own. This meinen, opinion, is the funda­
.

.

mental state of all representing in which natural consciousness moves. For
this reason, Hegel is able to say in the paragraph that natural consciousness
"sticks to a system of opinion."
What Hegel calls natural consciousness is by no means the same as sen­
sory consciousness. Natural consciousness is alive in all shapes of the spirit;
it lives each spiritual shape in its own way, including (and especially) that
shape of absolute knowledge which occurs as absolute metaphysics and is
at times visible to a few thinkers only. This metaphysics is far from having
collapsed when it was confronted by the positivism of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries; on the contrary, the modem technological world in its
unlimited entitlement is nothing other than natural consciousness which
(in accordance with the manner of its opinion) has at last made feasible the
unlimited, self-securing production of all beings through the inexorable
objectification of each and every thing. Nonetheless, absolute metaphysics
is not the caul;e of what is established in its way as the confirmation of what

112

H EG E L'S CONCEPT OF E X P E R I F.l'iCE

takes place in the essence of technology. The naturalness of consciousness
is not based on the senses and what can be perceived by the senses, but
rather on what consciousness is cognizant of
and as such is received

[aufgeht]

without mediation

[eingeht] by consciousness without mediation. In this

way natural consciousness also accepts all that is not sensory, whether the
non-sensory (reason and logic) or supra-sensory (the spiritual).
On the other hand, as soon as the appearing of phenomenal knowledge
comes to light, this seeming is what matters in knowledge. Natural con­
sciousness sees itself placed in another light without, however, ever being
able to glimpse this light as such. In this light, natural knowledge loses

its

truth, since this truth now turns out to be the not-yet-true; for the appear­
ance of the phenomenon which is itself is its own truth and reality. The
presentation of the appearance realizes what had been "only the concept of
knowledge." It produces the real in its reality; it empowers reality within
the real. In the process, phenomena arc neither eliminated nor cut off from
real knowledge. They are safeguarded
in truth

[U.Ohrheit]

[verwalnt] in the real

knowledge that

is their own, i.e., their own reality and truth.

In fact,

natural consciousness and real knowledge arc the same since the fonner as
not-yet-true necessarily belongs with the latter as its truth. I lowever, for
that very reason the two arc not identical

[das G/eiche].

From the perspective of natural consciousness, the presentation of phe­
nomenal knowledge in its appearance continually disturbs what natural con­
sciousness takes to be true. Such disturbance about truth can be regarded as
doubt. llowever, the path of sheer doubt, like the course Descartes traverses
in his Meditatio11s, is of another sort. Although it calls many different modes
of representation into question, it does so only in order to remain at the
point from which the examination set out: to learn to doubt, which itself is
not doubted at all. The path of doubt only makes clear that doubting has
already brought itself to safety, certainty, which is taken as the fimdamm­

tum absolutum. But the absoluteness of this absolute is neither doubted, nor
questioned, nor even just cited in its essence. As Hegel is aware that abso­
lute knowledge can only exist when it begins (however else it begins) with
absoluteness, his path is different. For Hegel's thinking, therefore, natural
consciousness appears for the first time in the land proper to it; though
Descartes sets foot on the land of modem philosophy (the sttbiecttmt as the
ego cogito), fundamentally he docs not see the country at all.
In the absolute presentation of phenomenal knowledge, there is no way
for natural consciousness to return to its truth. The path of the presentation
of phenomena in their appearing is "the conscious insight into the untruth

113

OFF THE B EATF.:\' TRACK

of the phenomenal knowledge, for which that is the most real which is
after all only the unrealized concept ."

En 1"0ute natural consciousness loses

definitively that which had been ito; truth, but it never loses its own self
in the process. Instead, it establishes itself in its old way in the new truth.
From the point of view of the science of phenomenal knowledge, the way
of presentation is the way of despair for natural consciousness, though such
consciousness does not know it. Natural consciousness ito;elf, however, never
despairs. Doubt

[Zweijeln] in the sense of despair [ Verz:weiflung] is the matter

for the presentation, i.e., for absolute knowledge. However, the presentation
also despairs on this path, not of itself, but of natural consciousness, because
such consciousness has no intention of realizing what it is, constantly - the
mere concept of knowledge; and yet it never ceases to claim for itself the
truth of knowledge and to pretend to be the only norm for knowledge.
The more fully the presentation goes the way of despair, the sooner science
completes its own phenomenon.
The presentation of phenomenal knowledge brings

[/n7ngt] itself fully
[vollig] into the constancy of despair. It brings [Vo/lbringen] despair to ful­
fillment. I Iegel writes that it is "the thoroughgoing [sich vollbringende] skep­
ticism." We thus restore to the word "skepsis" its original meaning: crt<EifJIS
signifies the seeing

[Sehrn],

watching

[Zusehen],

inspecting

[muhsieht) what and how beings arc as beings.

[Besehen],

that

Skepsis understood

like this follows the being of beings with its eyes open. Its watching has
seen the being of beings in advance. This is the perspective from which it
inspects the matter itself. Thinkers are intrinsically skeptics about beings
be<.-ause of the skepsis into being.
Skepsis moves and stands within the light of the ray by which the ab­
soluteness of the absolute - the absoluteness that in and for itself is with
us - has already touched us. The having-seen of skepsis is the
seen and

vidi (I

have

I see now) which has the reality of the real in view. If, however,

reality is the appearance of phenomenal knowledge, then appearance at­
tains its presentation only if the presentation follows appearance and moves
as its wake. In this movement, the appearance of phenomena comes to be
attached to the presentation. In this coming, the phenomena themselves,
taking themselves to be the real, go away. This intrinsically united coming
and going is the movement as which consciousness itself

is. Consciousness

is in the unity of natural and real knowledge, a unity by which conscious­
ness places itself in relation to itself in accordance with the knowledge it
has of itself in each case, and by which it appears in the condition of having
so been placed

[Gestelltheit]. Thus consciousness is always a shape [Gestalt].
1 14

I IE G EL'S CO:'>lCEPT OF EXPERIE:'>ICE

Skcpsis drops into consciousness, which develops into skepticism, which in
the appearance of phenomena produces and transfonns one shape of con­
sciousness into the other. Consciousness is consciousness in the mode of
thoroughgoing skepticism. Skepticism is the history of consciousness itself,
which is neither natural consciousness merely in itself, nor real knowledge
merely for itself, but rather the originary unity of both of them, in and for
itself. That movement of the coming of appearance and of the going of phe­
nomena is the happening which, from shape to shape, brings consciousness
into the sight - that is, the image - of its essence. This history is the "the
history of the process of training and ed11cating consciousness itself up to the
level of science." Hegel does not say: "the history of the process

of training

and educating natural consciousness up to the level of the philosophical;" he
is thinking only of the appearance of phenomenal consciousness in view of
its complete coming forth. A'> this coming forth, consciousness is already
science itself.
Thoroughgoing skepticism is the historicity of history. It is as this history
that consciousness develops into the phenomenon of absolute knowledge.
Skepticism is no longer taken here as an attitude of the isolated human sub­
ject. If that were the case, it would remain the mere subjective resolution
never to rely on a foreign authority but rather to test everything oneself,
i.e., according to the sense of this subject. Although this skepticism invokes
the unique understanding of a self-representing ego, it is not a skepsis into
the being of beings. Skepsis is not confined in the narrow horizon of what
is restricted to the self-evident.

In looking out upon the appearance of phe­

nomenal knowledge, it looks into the whole scope of phenomenal knowl­
edge. The isolated, self-representing

ego cogito remains trapped within this

scope. But perhaps even this scope, thought more essentially than Hegel
was able to think it, is still only a recollection of the
of the

ego cogito, a

esse

of the

ens

certum

recollection in the shape of its extension into the reality

of absolute knowledge. Admittedly, this extension requires the antecedent

[vorgiingige]

skepsis into the breadth of the self-appearing unconditional

subjectity. However, this action

[ Vorgehen]

is at the same time the decisive

and complete retreat into that truth of beings which, as absolute certainty,
takes itself to be being itself.
At this point, it is no longer possible to avoid a clarification of the lan­
guage we have been using and which is now in need of clarification. Once he
settled on his terminology, I lege) identifies·as "beings" that which becomes
objective in immediate representation. These objects

[Gegenstiindliche]

are

that which is represented one-sidedly and exclusively from the side of

OFF THE BEATE� TRACK

standing-against

[Gegenstehen]

without taking either representation or that

which represents into consideration. "Being," the tenn used by Hegel for
beings, is the name for that which actually is not yet truly the true and
the real. I legcl uses "being" to designate the reality which in his sense is
still untrue. It is in this way that he interprets ancient philosophy. Because
ancient philosophy had not yet set foot in that land of philosophy (self­
consciousness) where represented objects first exist as such, it thinks the
real only as beings. For Hegel, "being" is always taken in the reduction
"only being," for true beings are the

actualitas,

em actu,

the effectively real, whose

effective reality, consists in the knowledge of self-knowing cer­

tainty. Only this certainty

can

truly - which now means out of the con­

stant certainty of absolute knowledge - claim to "he" all reality,

the

re­

ality. Of course it is right here, where being was supposed to disappear,
that it recurs. J lowever, the absolute knowledge of science takes no notice
of it.
In contrast to Hegel's language, we use the word "being" both for what
Hegel (with Kant) calls "objectiveness

[Objektivitiit)" and

[Gegenstiindlichkeit]" and "objectivity

for what he represents as the truly real and the reality

of spirit. We do not, as Hegel does from his perspective, interpret

elva1,

being for the Greeks, as the objectivity of inunediate representation by a
subjectivity that has not yet arrived at itself. Not from this perspective,
that is, but from the perspective of the Greek

'AI.{J6e1a

as the presencing

out of and into unhiddenness. I lowever, the presence that happens in the
representation by the skepsis of consciousness is a mode of presentness that
essences as much as the ovaia of the Greeks out of the yet unthought essence
of a concealed time. The beingness of beings - which from the beginning of
Greek thinking to Niet7.sche's theory of the eternal return of the same has
happened as the truth of beings - is for us only one mode (even if a decisive
one) of being which by no means must necessarily appear exclusively as the
presence of what presences.• In the way Hegel uses the word "being," he
should not, strictly speaking, have continued to designate that which for him
is the true reality of the real, spirit, with a word still containing "being." And
yet he does so everywhere, since the essence of spirit is self-consciousness,
literally being-self-conscious. The usage is not, of course, the consequence

of an imprecise and inconsistent tenninology but rather is a result of the
concealed manner in which being itself discloses and hides itself.
However, if our reading of Hegel's text imposes the word "being" on
the appearance of phenomenal knowledge, as well as on the absoluteness of
the absolute, then this may very well appear at first to be arbitrary. Yet it is
neither arbitrary, nor an instance of mere tenninology (assuming it is at all
licit to bring the language of thinking together with a terminology, which
in accordance with its essence is an instrument of the sciences). Rather, the
language of thinking, which has grown on the basis of it.'i destiny, calls what
has been thought in other thinking into the clarity of its own thinking, in
order to release the former into its own essence.
What happens when the skepsis of consciousness anticipates the appear­
ance of phenomenal knowledge and presents it? To what extent does the
presentation thereby make its appearance in such a way that it ceases to be
a mere entry on the stage? The presentation escapes this only when it is
certain that there appears in it the entire history of the formation of con­
sciousness. It is in the structures of consciousness that natural consciousness
is able to find the truth of all its shapes.

The seventh panq;rapb develops the question concerning "the completeness
of the forms of unreal consciousness." These arc the shapes of phenomenal
knowledge, because this knowledge has not yet appeared in its appearance
and so been placed into its reality. The complete coming forth of the shapes
can only result from the route of its arrival. This route [Gang] is the progress

[./<ortgnng]

of appearance. It must be a necessary progress. For it is only in

this way that a tight cohesiveness prevents any accidental gaps. What is it
that makes the progress in the route of the presentation necessary?

In what

does the essence of the progress consist?
In order to answer in the right way, we must not continue to hold the
view which natural consciousness generally adopts of the presentation of
phenomenal knowledge. Out of principle this view is one-sided, for natural
representation always sees only one side (which for it is not even a side,
hut rather the entirety), the side of things that meet it outright. Natural
consciousness never looks on the other side, never looks to the being of
beings. This essential one-sidedness of natural consciousness can even come
on the scene as a proper shape of consciousness. It must expose itsel f to us
within the history of its formation. It shows itself to be that skepticism
which comes to an end in all knowledge and behavior by finding that there
is nothing to the knowledge that was supposed to have been acquired. A'i

1 17

OFF TI-l E B EATE� TRACK

the sheer addiction to doubt possessed by an unconditional sophistry, this
skepticism has a constant result: empty nothingness.
To what extent, within this shape of the consciousness, has the one­

sidedness of natural knowledge been e levated into a known principle? 'lo the
extent that natural consciousness finds everywhere and always only beings,
only phenomena, and judges all that meets it in accordance with the results

of its findings. \Vhatever is not of the nature of its finding falls victim to
the decree that there is no such thing. Natural consciousness only finds
beings, and being is not of the nature of what it finds. For this reason the
appearance of phenomena, the reality of the real, are taken as something void
from within the perspective of natural consciousness. In the judgment of
natural consciousness, every step taken by the presentation of phenomenal
knowledge leads to nothing. The pre.'ientation never gets beyond the first
step, which has already led it to nothing. How is the presentation to go
further from there, and where is it to go? Any progress will remain denied
to it unless it continually permits another shape of phenomenal knowledge
to come to it from somewhere, in order to find in this other shape the
intended appearance and with it to fall again into nothingness.
The view to which natural consciousness must be devoted whenever it
makes judgments about the presentation of phenomenal knowledge, how­
ever, is expressed often enough in the objections, supposedly philosophical,
that have been advanced against l legel's philosophy.

In

defense, Hegel in

the paragraph under discussion only says that the nothingness to which
the presentation of knowledge that is appearing in its appearance leads is
not empty, but rather "the nothing of that out of which it comes as a re­
sult." Now appearance comes as a result of the phenomena, that is, of those
things that appear. Consequently, if what results from the progress for the
presentation is a result of where its course has come from and not as a result
of where its next step has yet to go, then it is no wonder that the natural
consciousness finds the course of the presentation strange. It is all the more
essential to prevent from the start the one-sided view which natural con­
sciousness adopts about the progress of the presentation; it is a view which
causes total confusion.

Tbc eighth pamgroph sketches the characteristic movement of the historical
route of the historical fonnations of consciousness. The progress through
the complete succession of shapes is supposed to ensue of its own accord.
"Of its own accord" can only mean here: on the basis of the way that con­
sciousness in itself is a route. That is why consciousness has to come into

1 18

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPER IENCE

consideration at this point. Accordingly, this paragraph leads up to the first
of the three statements about consciousness which Hegel expresses in our
text. "Formation of consciousness" means: consciousness puts itself in the
picture concerning its own essence, which is to be science in the sense of
absolute knowledge. lwo things follow: consciousness appears to itself in
its appearance and at the same time establishes itself in the light of its own
essence in accordance with the essential aspects of its seeming, and it thus
organizes itself as the realm of its own shapes. Consciousness itself is nei­
ther only natural consciousness nor only real consciousness. Nor is it just
the coupling of the two. Consciousness itself is the originary unity of the
two. Real and natural knowledge do not lie in consciousness like lifeless bits
of inventory. Consciousness

is both of them since

it appears to itself in the

originary unity of both of them and as this unity.• The two are distinguished
in consciousness. How? The distinction prevails as the restlessness of the
natural against the real and the real against the natural. Consciousness itself
is intrinsically this restlessness of the self-distinguishing between natural
and real knowledge. The movement of the course of history is based on this
restlessness of consciousness itself and has even already taken its direction
from it. Consciousness is not set in motion only after the fact, nor only then
pointed in its direction.
In the historical route of its fonnation, natural consciousness proves

itself "to be only the concept of knowledge." Still, this "only" is already
sufficient. That is, since natural consciousness, in representing beings, in­
evitably though not explicitly co-represents the beingness of beings, natural
consciousness is in it.c;elf beyond and yet not outside itself. Not only does
natural consciousness take no notice of the "concept" which it is all along,
it even thinks that it can manage without it - though in truth that realm of
beings in which natural consciousness is resident is determined, in its scope
and in how to dominate it, uniquely on the basis of what consciousness
itself is as the knowledge of the beingness of beings. However, natural con­
sciousness conceals from itself the restlessness of the beyond-itself which
prevails in it. It flees before that restlessness and so, in its own way, binds
itself to it. Natural consciousness takes its opinion as the true, and thus
enlists truth for itself, which shows that what it takes to be its own is not its
own. Its own opinion constantly betrays its restlessness at being tom inex­
orably into the beyond-itself. The presentation of phenomenal knowledge

I 19

OFF TI-l E B EATf:;\1 TRACK

has only to be drawn into this restlessness in order to find itself already in
the route of its progress. The inexorableness of the movement, however,
can only be determined on the basis of that to which restlessness in itself
is held. Restlessness holds itself to that which tears it away. What tears it
away is the reality of the real, which

is only

in that it appears to itself in

its truth. The reality of the real, seen from the direction of the progress,
is the goal of the route. Thought on the basis of the restlessness of con­
sciousness, the route begins with the goal. The route is a movement out
away from the goal, hut in such a way that the goal is not left behind hut
rather arrives, with the movement itself, precisely at its own development.
The goal of the route of consciousness is fixed for knowledge in its essence
as this very knowledge.

In its very restlessness,

consciousness is the goal's

fixing-itself-before. This is the reason that the eighth paragraph hegins its
characterization of the motion of consciousness with the sentence "The

goal,

however, is fixed for knowledge just as necessarily as the succession

in the process." The paragraph, however, does not discuss the goal, or at
least not in the form in which it is usually represented, by taking it to be
that toward which something is driven. Were i t permissible here to adopt
a locution from mechanics, we could say: progress in the historical route
of the historical formations of consciousness is not pushed forward by the
shape that consciousness has taken at a given time into what has not yet
been detennined; rather, it is pulled by the goal that has already been fixed.
In its attraction, the attractive goal brings itself forth into its appearance,
and it brings the route of consciousness, in advance, into the plenty of its
plentifulness.
Through its skepsis, thoroughgoing skepticism has already brought this
goal into sight and thereby brought it into the center of the restlessness of
consciousness itself. Because this center is constantly beginning the move­
ment, the skepsis that prevails in the essence of knowledge has therefore
already encompassed all possible fonns of consciousness.

In keeping with

this encompassment, the compass of the forms of unreal knowledge is com­
plete. The way that the presentation represents all phenomenal knowledge
in its appearance is nothing but the co-accomplishing of the skepsis that
prevails in the essence of consciousness. Skepsis endures in advance the
inexorable tearing of consciousness out beyond itself, i.e., the tearing of
natural out into real knowledge. In this tearing, natural consciousness loses
what it takes as its truth and its life. This tearing is thus the death of nat­
ural consciousness. In this constant death, consciousness offers up its own
death as a sacrifice to gain its resurrection to itself out of the sacrifice. In

1 20

I I EG EL'S CO:-.ICEPT OF EX PF.R I E:-.ICE

this tearing, natural consciousness suffers violence. However, this violence
comes from consciousness itself. Violence is the prevailing of restlessness
in consciousness itself. This prevailing is the will of tl1e absolute that wants
to be in its absoluteness in and for itself among us, with us, we who reside
constantly in the mode of natural consciousness in the midst of beings.
Now perhaps me sentence which we have called the first statement about
consciousness may have become clearer: "Consciousness, however, is for
itself its own

concept

.

.

.

" This means something different from what the

reference at the beginning of the sixth paragraph means: "Natural con­
sciousness will prove itself to be only the concept of knowledge . . . " The
discussion is now concerned not with natural consciousness but rather with
consciousness itself as such. The word "concept" is now specifically em­
phasized. "Concept" now means: the appearing-to-itself of consciousness
in its truth. The essence of this truth is based on unconditional certainty.
In keeping with this certainty, something known has not yet been grasped
conceptually if it has only been represented in general. It must rather be
referred back, in being known, to m e knowledge that belongs to it, and it
must be represented in this relation with that very knowledge. The known,
only in this way, is totally within knowledge; as a result, knowledge be­
comes a general representation (a conceiving) in an encompassing and also
unconditional sense. In relation to this concept, in which consciousness it­
self conceives of itself, natural consciousness is always "only the concept."
For insofar as it is consciousness, it has an idea of what it is to be known
generally. It is only because consciousness is for itself its own concept that
natural consciousness (as something that belongs to consciousness itself)
can persist in being only the concept of knowledge. However, we will not
understand the first statement about consciousness until we not only pay at­
tention to the distinction which Hegel stresses between

"concept" and "only

the concept" but also reconsider our reflections in the last paragraphs. In
the sentence "Consciousness, however, is for itself its own concept" the stress
actually falls on the "is." The "is" has this significance: consciousness brings
about its own appearing-to-itself, and as it does so it fom1s for itself, in its
appearing-to-itself, the site of appearance; this site is part of its essence. In
this way consciousness finds itself in its concept.
Since Hegel has demonstrated the truth ofconsciousness in the first state­
ment about consciousness, he is now able to clarify natural consciousness in
respect to its being unreal knowledge. He also calls it untrue consciousness.
However, in no way does this mean that natural consciousness is merely the
overburden of the false, deceptive, and erroneous. Rather, it means: natural

121

OFF THF. B EATEN TRACK

consciousness is always the not-yet-true, which is overmastered by the vi­
olence which tears it forth into its truth. Natural consciousness feels this
violence and falls into anxiety about its own continued existence. Hegel,
whose rationalism cannot be sufficiently praised or reviled, speaks in the
decisive passage (where he identifies the relation of natural knowledge to
the being of beings) of the "feeling of violence." This feeling of will's vi­
olence - the will that is how the absolute is describes the way in which
natural consciousness is "only the concept of knowledge." Still it would be
foolish to think that Hegel is of the opinion that the natural anxiety which
makes consciousness evade the being of beings is also the mode in which,
or indeed the organ through which, philosophy thinks the being of beings,
simply because it is the natural relation to being. This would mean that
when thinking has to refer back to feeling, philosophy too would at once be
handed over to sheer feeling instead of being grounded in science. How­
ever, this superficial opinion (which has its adherents today as ever) is itself
part of the vanity of an understanding that gloats over the indolence of its
thoughtlessness and which dissipates everything into its thoughtlessness. It
is at the end of this paragraph, the same paragraph which with that first
statement about consciousness looks out into the truth of knowledge, that
the untruth of knowledge appears in the shape of the "barren ego." In re­
stricting itself to the beings that encounter it, the barren ego finds its only
satisfaction.
The "barren ego" is the name for the imperious behavior of ordinary
opinion within philosophy. Nonetheless, the term does not identify an "I"
isolated in itself in distinction to a community of the "We." The "barren
ego," rather, is precisely the subject of the many in their common opinion.
The "barren ego" lives in the egoism of the "they" [ntan), who escape from
their anxiety at thoroughgoing skepticism into the dogmatism of opinion.
The dogmatic principle is to close one's eyes at the presentation of phenom­
enal knowledge and to refuse to go along with the advance of that presen­
tation. For this reason, the dogmatism of customary opinions must be left
to its own devices. With this decision, philosophy does not reject natural
consciousness. How could it, seeing that science is the truth of the not-yet­
true, and so it is the not-yet-true, though in the truth of the not-yet-true.
Philosophy is the first to discover natural consciousness in its naturalness
and to recognize it. On the other hand, philosophy docs indeed move past
natural consciousness when this consciousness puts on philosophical airs
in order to erase the boundary separating it from philosophy and to tum
its back on philosophy as the !mowledge of the being of beings. However,
-

122

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIENCE

in this case philosophy only moves past what had already turned its back
on philosophy, what had already turned away from it; philosophy, however,
in moving past natural consciousness, nonetheless docs not neglect it but
rather concerns itself exclusively with it in order to be the route through
which the truth of consciousness appears.
The presentation of phenomenal knowledge is thoroughgoing skepti­
cism. In going thoroughly, it works itself out fully lfohrt sich aus]. The
presentation brings itself forward [fiihrt sich vm·], instead of merely entering
upon the stage. The path of the presentation does not go from natural to real
consciousnc.'is, but rather consciousness itself, which exists as this distinc­
tion between natural and real in every shape of consciousness, progresses
from one shape to another. This progress is a route whose movement is de­
termined out of the goal, i.e., out of the violence of the will of the absolute.
The presentation, which the appearance of phenomenal knowledge comes
to meet, follows that appearance. The natural representation of absolute
knowledge - that it is a means - has now disappeared. Nor does knowledge
now let itself be put any longer to the test, at least not as a means that is
applied to an object. Moreover, since the presentation itself presents itself,
testing seems to have become quite superfluous. Therefore, after this clar­
ification, the presentation could begin immediately. But it does not begin,
assuming that it has not already begun. New sections of reflection follow.
This betrays that the essence of the presentation of phenomenal knowledge
has not yet been brought sufficiently near us and that a relation of our own
to the presentation has not yet been gained. The way that the presentation
and what is to be presented belong together, whether and to what extent
the two are even the same though without being confounded indifferently,
is still obscure. If the absolute in and for itself is already with us, how is
absolute knowledge supposed to be a path to the absolute? If here we may
still speak at all of a path, then we may do so only of the path along which the
absolute itself goes because it is this path. Could the presentation of phe­
nomenal knowledge be this path and route? The essence of the presentation
has grown still more enigmatic. All that remains clear is that the presen­
tation does not come from somewhere else, cut off from the absolute, in
order to face the absolute, as natural consciousness represents knowledge.

The ninth pamgraph, all the same, takes up again just this natural representa­
tion of knowledge. Of course it does so onlyin order to pose once again the
question of the critical examination of absolute knowledge. That knowledge
is not a means is far from invalidating the critical examination of knowledge;

1 23

OFF THE BEATE� TRACK

on the contrary, it is only now, in fact, that the examination can be made
worthy of investigation. When the presentation brings phenomenal knowl­
edge forth into its appearance, it places the not-yet-true consciousness into
its truth. It measures the phenomena appearing as such phenomena accord­
ing to their appearance. Appearance is the criterion. From where does the
presentation take this criterion? In taking over the critical examination of
phenomenal knowledge, science itself comes onto the scene as the court
and thus as the criterion of the examination. Science's entry onto the scene
may very well he the carrying out of the presentation; nonetheless, with its
first step, science must bring with it the criterion of critical examination
as an already proven criterion. On the one hand, science, in order to be
carried out, needs the criterion; on the other hand, the criterion can only
be given in the course of carrying it out, asswning, that is, that absolute
knowledge is not able to adopt a criterion from just anywhere. Whenever
the presentation must measure untrue knowledge by its truth, it is obliged
to reconcile the irreconcilable. The impossible stands in its way. I low is this
obstacle to be removed?

The tmth panzgraph

continues this reflection and shows that Hegel is not

glossing over or eliminating the contradiction in the essence of the presenta­
tion by means of logical arguments. The apparently irreconcilable does not
lie in the essence of the presentation. It is the fault of the inadequate way in
which we see the presentation, we who continue to be dominated by the rep­
resentational mode of natural consciousness. The presentation approaches
the appearance of knowledge. The presentation, too, is a knowledge. They
both fall within consciousness itself. If the question about the criterion and
the critical examination has any validity, then it can find its answer only
in and from consciousness. Is consciousness itself, as consciousness, in it­
self something like a measure or a criterion? Is consciousness as such of
its own accord a critical examination? Consciousness itself is now moving
more clearly into the light in which it may be essentially seen. Nonetheless,
the fundamental trait in the essence of consciousness at which reflection is
aiming is not coming to light.
As though he had said nothing at all in the previous paragraphs about

consciousness, Hegel hegins by referring to two determinations "as they
are found in consciousness." He calls them knowledge and truth. They are
called "abstract determinations" because they are a product of an inspec­
tion of consciousness that has lost sight of the full essence of the condition
of consciousness and the unity of that condition. Here consciousness is

1 24

H EGEL'S C:O�CEPT O F EXPERI Er-.;'CE

understood as presenting itself immediately (i.e., ever one-sidedly) to nat­
ural representation.
Consciousness [Bewusst-sein] states that something is in the state of be­
ing known [Gewussten). \Vhat is known, however, exists in knowledge and
as a knowledge. This known is that to which consciousness, in the mode of
knowledge, relates itself. \Vhat stands in this relation is the known. It ex­
ists, in that it is "for" consciousness. Such beings are in the mode of "being
for . . . " However, "being for" is a mode of knowledge. In this mode some­
thing is "for consciousness," but it is also something else for consciousness,
namely something that is known. In knowledge as "being for," the one thing
and the other are "for consciousness." However, it is not simply that the
known is represented in general, but rather that this representation thinks
of the known as a being that exists in itself (i.e., truthfully). This being-in­
itself of the known is called truth. 'I ruth, too, is both one thing (something
represented) and another (a being-in-itselt) "for consciousness." The two
determinations of consciousness, knowledge and truth, are distinguished
as "being for" and "being-in-itself." Hegel simply turns our attention to
these two determinations without going into "what really lies in them."
Nonetheless, Hegel has imperceptibly, though intentionally, indicated a
fundamental and distinguishing trait of consciousness. The first sentences
of the paragraph even name it in passing.
In consciousness something is distinguished from3 consciousness by con­
sciousness. As itself, and through itself, it is one thing in relation to another.
\Vhat is made distinct in this distinction (the object for the subject in the
subject), however, remains related by the distinction precisely to what distin­
guishes it. In representing, consciousness cuts something off from itself, but
what has been cut off it adds to itself. Consciousness is a differentiation that
does not differentiate. As this difference that is not different, consciousness
in its essence is ambiguous. This ambiguity is the essence of representation.
The ambiguity is the reason that the two determinations, knowledge and
truth, "being for" and "being-in-itself," are immediately found everywhere
in consciousness, and in fact arc themselves ambiguous.
\Vhat is the presentation now that it, as representation, itself remains
a mode of consciousness, seen from the perspective of the two determi­
nations? It represents the phenomena in their appearance. It inquires into
knowledge about its truth. It examines knowledge for its truth. It moves
within the differentiation of the difference as which consciousness itself is.
•

OFF TilE BF.ATE:-.1 TRACK

So with a glance toward this difference, a prospect is opened onto the es­
sential possibility that the presentation gets its criterion and its character of
critical examination from that in which it moves. The prospect will become
clearer as soon as there emerges that toward which - seen from the perspec­
tive of consciousness itself- the measuring examination is approaching.

The eleventh paragraph asks directly what is the object of the inquiry by
the presentation of phenomenal knowledge. However, the question is not
raised directly until it asks not only what is being inquired into but also
who is inquiring. This is because the object of our inquiry, if it is something
that is known, will be in our knowledge for us who are inquiring. With
this characterization of a science that presents phenomenal knowledge in
its appearance, we unexpectedly come into the play of the presentation.
It proves to be the case that we are already in the play, in that what the
presentation presents is "for us." Therefore the question cannot be evaded
concerning the role that falls to the "for us" in science. The repercussions
of that question reach into a dimension which we now scarcely imagine.
What are we inquiring into when we examine knowledge for its truth?
Truth is being-in-itself. Knowledge is being for a consciousness. When we
inquire into [untersuchm] the truth of knowledge, we are seeking [suchm]
knowledge in itself. However, through our inquiry knowledge becomes oUT
object. If we were to place it in its being-in-itself before us, if we were to
represent it, it would have become a being for us. We would not be grasping
the truth of knowledge but only OUT knowledge of knowledge. Being for
us would remain the criterion with which we would measure the being­
in-itself of knowledge. Yet how would knowledge have arrived at such a
point where it conforms to a criterion that changes what is supposed to be
measured into the measure? If the presentation of phenomenal knowledge
is to be conducted by the results of considering the two determinations of
consciousness, knowledge and truth, then all that the presentation can do
is continually change its behavior into the opposite.

The twelfth paragraph frees the presentation from this new difficulty. The
presentation is freed as a result ofthe straightforward reference to the nature
of the object which it presents. The object is consciousness itself. Its nature
is that which comes forth on its own into appearance. Does consciousness
have the character of a criterion from within its own nature? If it does, then
consciousness on its own must present the possibility of being at once the
measure and the measured. It must be intrinsically differentiated in this

1 26

HEGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIENCE

respect but at the same time not different. Something like this came to light
in the tenth paragraph. The essential ambiguity of consciousness - to be
the difference of representation, which representation is at the same time
not a difference - points to a duality in the nature of consciousness. In it
there is the possibility to be in essence at once both the one and the other:
measure and measured. Let us take the ambiguity not as a lack of clarity but
rather as the mark of its essential unity. Then consciousness in its ambiguity
shows how those determinations, knowledge and truth, which at first had
been represented as divided, belong together. The possibility of measuring
and measure results from the nature of consciousness.
Hegel characterizes the nature of the object of the presentation that rep­
resents phenomenal knowledge in his second statement about conscious­
ness. The first, pronounced in the eighth paragraph, runs: "Consciousness,
however, is for itself its own

concept."

Now the second statement follows

it: "Consciousness furnishes its own criterion in it itself." The statement
is conspicuous in its language. Hegel, however, is intimately acquainted
with this language that is strange to us; his intimacy is a result of what has
proved to be the nature of the object. Why does Hegel say "in it itself

ibm selbst]" rather than "in itself [an sich selbst)"?

[an

Because one essential as­

pect of consciousness is that there is a criterion for it. The criterion is not
fetched from somewhere in order for consciousness to take it in itself and
so to have it for itself. Nor is the criterion something that is first applied
to consciousness. The criterion is part of consciousness itself, and this is
the case because criterionness is already a product of consciousness since
consciousness is dually measure and measured. But in that case would it not
be just as well or better to say that consciousness furnishes its criterion in
itself? Yet what is consciousness in itself? Consciousness is in itself when it
is by itself, and it is by itself when it is specifically for itself and thus in and
for itself. If consciousness furnished its criterion in itself, the implication,
rigorously thought, would be: consciousness furnishes itself a criterion for
itself. Yet ordinarily the question of what consciousness truly is is just what
consciousness pays no attention to. On the other hand, truth does not fall
to consciousness out of nowhere. Consciousness itself is already for itself
its concept. Therefore it has its criterion in it. Therefore it itself puts the
criterion at the disposal of it itself. The "in it itself" signifies the duality :
consciousness bears

the criterion in its essence. However, what

to consciousness and not to anything else is not something

given directly by consciousness to itself. It furnishes the criterion in it itself.
It gives, and yet at the same time it docs not give.

Inasmuch as natural consciousness represents beings in themselves, what
has been represented is therefore true and moreover true "for it," that is,
for the consciousness that represents immediately. I lege] uses this "for it"
(which usage corresponds to the "in it itselP') to mean that consciousness
holds to be true that which it has directly represented. In directly repre­
senting, consciousness is absorbed within what it represents and does not
specifically refer this back to itself as the representer. It is true that con­
sciousness docs have what it represents within its representation, but not
for itself, only "for it." However, along with its true representation for it,
consciousness in it itself has also given "for us" (we who attend to the truth
of the true) the truth of the true, i.e., the criterion. By presenting phe­
nomenal knowledge as such, we take appearance as the criterion in order
thereby to measure the knowledge which takes these phenomena as true. In
phenomenal knowledge, the true is that which knowledge knows. If we call
this particular truth the object and this knowledge the concept, then the
critically examining presentation of phenomena in respect to their appear­
ance consists in our watching whether knowledge (i.e., that which natural
consciousness takes to be its knowledge) corresponds to what this partic­
ular truth is. Or conversely, if we call the knowledge that we are critically
examining the object and the in-itself of the known the concept, then the
critical examination consists in watching whether the object corresponds to
the concept. What is decisive, what is crucial to grasp about this point, is
the following: each time that we represent the phenomena in their appear­
ance, that which we measure and that with which we measure fall within
consciousness itself. Consciousness in it itself supplies the two essential mo­
ments of the critical examination. For us, the presenters, the result is the
maxim which directs all representation of phenomena in their appearance.
It runs: leave all your notions and opinions about phenomena aside. Ac­
cordingly, the fundamental attitude of absolute knowledge docs not consist
in bombarding phenomenal consciousness with an array ofknowledges and
arguments but rather in leaving these aside. By leaving them aside we attain
to the pure watching which enables us to see appearance. In watching we
are enabled to "consider the matter as it actually is

in itself and [01· itself."

The matter, however, is phenomenal knowledge as phenomenal. The state
of the matter, the reality of the real, is appearance itself.
Phenomenal consciousness is in it itself what is to be measured and the
criterion of measure. Hegel's way of making clear that both fall within con­
sciousness itself merely gives the impression of a dubious wordplay that
invites suspicion. Knowledge, and the true that is known in knowledge,

1 28

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIE�CE

belong to consciousness. It appears to come to the same thing whether we
call knowledge the concept and the true the object or, conversely, the true
the concept and knowledge the object. In fact it does come to the same
thing. However, that does not imply that there is no difference - and that
therefore it is a matter of indifference - in the way we use the terms concept
and object. If the true that has been represented in natural consciousness is
called the object, then this is the object "for it," for natural consciousness.
If, however, knowledge is called the object, then knowledge as phenomenal
knowledge is the object "for us," who are considering phenomena in re­
gard to their appearance. If the knowledge by which natural consciousness
represents the known is called the concept, then conceiving is the represen­
tation of something as something. In this case, the word "concept" is taken
in the sense of traditional logic. If on the other hand the true that has been
represented in consciousness is called the concept by which knowledge as
object for us has been measured, then the concept is the truth of the true,
the appearance, in which phenomenal knowledge is brought to itself.
This use of the terms object and concept seems at first sight to be willful,
but it is in no way arbitrary. It has been tied in advance to the nature
of consciousness, a nature which is expressed in the first statement about
consciousness: "Consciousness, however, is for itself its own

concept."

In

what consciousness holds to be true, a shape of its truth is made real. The
true is the object "for it." 'Iruth is the object "for us." Hegel expresses this
in the sentence which we may now, with the help of our own emphasis,
understand more clearly: "Thus in what consciousness inside itself declares
to

be the "in-itself" or "true," we (that is, we who know absolutely) have

the criterion which

it

itself sets up, and by which we are to measure

its

knowledge."
Because the criterion for critical examination has been placed at our
disposal out of consciousness itself, the examination in this respect needs
no addition from us. However, the fact that this is at our disposal insofar as
we ourselves are consciousness does not mean that it is yet explicitly at our
disposal. The presentation may be placed under the maxim of pure watching,
but it still remains obscure how we are to receive anything through merely
leaving our views aside and how it is that we already have the criterion
as such. Let us admit that the knowledge that is to be measured and the
criterion fall within consciousness in such a way that all we have to do is
accept them; even so, measuring and achieVing the measurement do not go
on their own without our addition. In the end, is not what is essential in
the presentation still left to our own activity? And what about the critical

1 29

OFF Ti l E BEATEN TRACK

examination itself, without which neither the measured nor the criterion is
what it is?

The thirteenth paragraph answers this question by giving, and explaining,
the third statement about consciousness. The statement is inconspicuously
relegated to a subordinate clause. In the form of a main clause, it runs: "Con­
sciousness critically examines itself." This means: consciousness, insofar as it
is consciousness, is critical examination. The fundamental word of modern
metaphysics, consciousness or being-conscious, has not been thought until
we also think, within this "being-," that characteristic ofcritical examination
which is determined by the consciousness of knowledge.
In critical examination, both the measure and what is to be measured are
together. Therefore, the fact that they are found together in consciousness
is never the result of an additional action whereby one of them is applied to
the other. The nature ofconsciousness consists of the cohesion of both. This
nature has been demonstrated in multiple respects. Natural consciousness
is the immediate knowledge of an object which it holds to be true. At the
same time, natural consciousness is a knowledge of its knowledge of the
object, even if it does not explicitly refer itself back to this knowledge. The
consciousness of the object and the consciousness of knowledge is the same,
and for that same both of them, object and knowledge, are known. Object
and knowledge are "for the same." The one and the other are at once for the
same, for consciousness itself. For it, consciousness is the differentiation of
the two against each other. In accordance with its nature, consciousness is
the comparison of the one with the other. This comparison is the critical
examination. "Consciousness critically examines itself."
However, consciousness is actually critical examination all the while only
in the sense that the question becomes for it in the first place the ques­
tion whether knowledge corresponds to the object of knowledge and so
is truly the object, whether the object corresponds to that which knowl­
edge fundamentally knows. The critical examination exists only through
the occurrence of such a process of becoming. This becoming comes over
consciousness when it finds out what that is in truth which it had imme­
diately taken to be true, when it finds out [dahinter kommt] what it then
knows with certainty once it represents the object in its objectivity. For
consciousness, accordingly, there must still be something behind the object
as well as behind its immediate representation of the object, something for
it to approach [dahin kommen], to which it must first have opened itself [sich
aufmachen] and for which it must first have set out [sich aufmachen].
1 30

I I EGEL'S C O !'/C E PT

OF EXPI-: R J ENCE

In the commentary on the first of the statements about consciousness it
became evident that natural consciousness is "only the concept of knowl­
edge." Admittedly, it has a general representation of its object as object, and
similarly of its knowledge as knowledge. Nonetheless, natural consciousness
ignores this "as," because it only accepts as valid what has been immediately
represented - even though it does so with the help, always, of this "as."
Because, in keeping with its own sense, it does not admit this "as," natural
consciousness stubbornly never goes back of its own accord to that which, in
a strange way, it has before itself as its own background. Thus consciousness
is comparison and then, again, it is not. By its own nature, when conscious­
ness represents an object, it is the differentiation between "being in itseiP'
and "being for itself," between truth and knowledge. Consciousness is not
only this differentiation which at the same time is not a differentiation; it is
also, thereby, a comparison of the object with its objectivity and of knowl­
edge with its knownness. Consciousness itself is the comparison, which,
admittedly, natural consciou'iness never explicitly carries out.
In the nature of consciousness knowledge and object are sundered, and
yet they can never be separate. Similarly, in the nature of consciousness
object and concept are sundered in that "as," and yet they can never be
separate. In the nature of consciousness the "both" is itself sundered and
yet cannot be separate. Hegel differentiates all this, but yet he levels out
the differences into a general differentiation, preventing them from com­
ing into their own. The concealed reason for this is found in the essence
of metaphysics, not in the fundamental metaphysical position of Hegel's
philosophy. The concealed essence of metaphysics is also the reason that
the level at which the differences have been leveled off is determined on the
basis of the discreteness of the one and the other; this discreteness is intro­
duced in the distinctions of mtio. Hegel grasps distinction as the negation
of negation.
With due caution and with the requisite caveats, a difference may be
adduced regarding the differentiations established by Hegel, a difference
that was mentioned elsewhere earlier. Because natural consciousness goes
directly to the object as a being, as well as to its knowledge of the object
as

a being, and because it remains constantly with them, natural conscious­

ness may be called ontic consciousness. The term "ontic" is derived from
the Greek TO

ov,

the being that is; it means that which concerns beings.

However, the Greek ov, a being, shelters within itself a particular essence of
beingness

(ovcrla), which has by no means remained the same in the course

of its history. In the thoughtful use of the tenns

131

ov and "a

being," the first

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

thing that has been presupposed is that we arc in fact thinking, that is, that
we are attentive to the way that the meaning is changing at any particular
time and to how the meaning in history becomes fixed at any particular
time. When beings appear as objects (since beingness has been illuminated
as objectivity) and when, consequently, being is received as non-objective,
all this is already based on an ontology by which the ov has been determined
as the \rrroKeiiJEVOv, and the \rrroKEi1Jevov as the ntbiectum, but the being of
the nlbiectum, in contrast, on the basis of the subjectity of consciousness.
Because ov means both "that which is [Seiendes]" as well as "being [Seiend],"
the ov as that which is can be gathered together (;\eye1v) with regard to the
fact of its being. In fact, in keeping with its ambiguity, the ov as that which
is is already gathered together with regard to its beingncss. It is ontological.
However, this gathering, the Myos, changes at any time as the essence of
the ov changes, and on the basis of it; and as the Myos changes, so does the
ontology. From the time the ov, that which presences, emerged as cj>vals, the
presence of what presences has been based, for Greek thinkers, in cj>alvea6a1,
in the self-displaying appearance of the unconcealed. Correspondingly, the
multiplicity of what presences, Ta oVTa, has been thought as that which in
its appearance is simply received as what presences. To receive means here:
to accept it without more ado and to content oneself with it in its pres­
encing. Receiving (5t)(ea6al) has nothing further to do. That is, it does not
think further about the presencing of what presences. It remains in 56�a. In
contrast, voeiv is that perception which examines [vernimmt] explicitly what
is present in its presencing and thereupon undertakes it [vornimmt].
The ambiguity of the ov identifies what presences as well as the presenc­
ing. lt identifies both at once but neither as such. 'Ia this essential ambiguity
of the ov there corresponds the fact that the voeiv of the elva�, of the £6v,
belongs together with the 56�a of the 5oKo0VTa, i.e., of the t6VTa. What the
voeiv perceive.c; is not that which truly is in contrast to mere seeming. Rather,
the 56�a perceives immediately that which itself presence.c;, rather than the
presencing of what presences, which presencing the voeiv perceives.
If we think - as it will he necessary to think from now on - of the essence
of metaphysics as the emergence of the twofoldness of prescncing and what
presences out of the self-concealing ambiguity of the ov, then the begin­
ning of metaphysics coincides with the beginning of Western thinking. On
the other hand, i f we take as the essence of metaphysics the separation of
a supersensory from a sensory world and if the supersensory is taken as
what truly is in contrast to the sensory as what merely appears to be, then
metaphysics begins with Plato and Socrates. Even so, what began with their

H EG EL ' S CONCEPT OF E X P E R I El':CE

thinking is only an explicitly oriented interpretation of the earlier twofold­
ness in ov. With this interpretation, the direness [Unwesen] of metaphysics
begins. Because of this direness, subsequent thinking till our own day has
mistaken the essential beginni ng of metaphysics. However, the direness that
we must think now is not a negative if we bear in mind that even in the essen­
tial beginning of metaphysics the difference prevailing in the ambiguity of
the ov remains unthought; in fact, this remaining-unthought constitutes the
essence of metaphysics. As it remains unthought, the Myos of the ov remains
ungrounded. I lowever, it is this ungroundedness that gives to onto-logy the
force of its essence.
Behind the rubric "ontology," the history of being conceals itself from
us. Ontological means: to carry out the gathering of beings in respect to
their bcingness. That creature is ontological which, in accordance with its
nature, stands within this history by enduring it each time in accordance
with the unconcealedness of beings. Thus we can say: in its immediate rep­
resentation of beings, consciousness is ontic consciousness. For ontic con­
sciousness, a being is an object. However, the representation of the object
represents, though unthinkingly, the object as object. It has already gath­
ered the object into its objectivity and is therefore ontological conscious­
ness. However, because natural consciousness fails to think objectivity as
such, while nonetheless representing it, natural consciousness both is on­
tological and yet is not. We say that ontic consciousness is pre-ontological.
As such, natural ontic-preontological consciousness is, latently, the distinc­
tion between the ontically true and the ontological truth. Consciousness,
being-conscious, means being this distim:tion; that is the reason that con­
sciousness, on the basis of its own nature, is the comparison of what has
been represented ontically and what ontologically. As this comparison, it
exists in critical examination. Intrinsically, representation by consciousness
is a natural putting-itself-to-the-test.
This is the reason that consciousness itself is never natural consciousness
solely in the mode of remaining cordoned off, as it were, from what its object
truly is and from what its knowledge is with certainty. Natural consciousness
rests in its own nature. It exists in accordance with one of the modes of its
nature. However, it is not itself its own nature. Rather, what it finds natural
is never to arrive at its own nature on its own, never, therefore, to arrive
at what is constantly going on behind its back. Nonetheless, as naturally
pre-ontological consciousness, it is already underway toward its truth. Yet
while underway, it already constantly turns back and remains for it. Ordinary
opinion is not concerned to watch what is [steckt] actually behind and what

133

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

hides

[sich versteckt] behind what it holds to be true. lt balks at this watching,

which is how skepsis has a look at what, as truth, is truly behind the true. One
day skepsis may even succeed in seeing that what philosophy had thought
of as "behind it" is in truth "in front of it." Natural consciousness never
discovers its truth, as its truth is its background. Its truth is itself, i.e., it is
in truth the foreground of the light within which every sort of knowledge
and consciousness already exists as a have-seen.
However, philosophy itself fights against skepsis at times. It prefers the
ordinary opinion of natural consciousness. It does admit that objectivity
must indeed belong to the object as object, but to philosophy objectivity
is only the non-objective. Philosophy likes ordinary opinion and even per­
suades it that it is actually right, on the grounds that the non-objective can
be represented only in the representations of natural consciousness, which
are as a result inadequate and so are a mere playing with symbols. These
assurances natural consciousness finds quite agreeable, and it even takes
from them the impression that these assurances constitute critical philoso­
phy because of their skeptical attitude toward ontology. However, this sort
of skepsis is only the semblance of skepsis; it is the flight from thinking into
a system of opinions.
On the other hand, when skepsis is achieved as thoroughgoing skepti­
cism, then thinking is en t·ottte within metaphysics as the comparison, expli­
citly carried out by ontological consciousness, of ontic and pre-ontological
consciousness. Ontological consciousness is not cut off from natural con­
sciousness, but rather returns into the nature of consciousness as the unity
of on tic and pre-ontological representation. When that comparison occurs,
the critical examination is underway. In that occurrence, consciousness is
its own appearing-to-itself in appearance. It is presencing to itself. It is.
Consciousness is, in that it comes into its truth, becomes to itself in its
truth.
Becoming is, in that the critical examination, which is a comparison, is
taking place [vor sich geht]. The critical examination can only proceed

[vo1· sich her geht]. Skepsis looks ahead of itself
care [sieht sich vor]. Skepsis looks ahead at what

and takes

knowledge and the object of knowledge are, truly. The sixth paragraph has
already made it clear that natural consciousness loses its truth on the path
of the examination. When that which natural consciousness presumes to
be true is considered with respect to truth, it turns out that knowledge
does not correspond to its object since knowledge is not concerned with
the objectivity of its object. In order to be fit for the truth of the object,

1 34

HEGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIENCE

consciousness must alter the previous knowledge. However, in altering its
knowledge of the object, the object has also been altered.
Objectivity is now the object, and what is now called the object can no
longer be settled on the basis of the former opinion about objects. Those
opinions, however, are still at play or at work where objectivity is claimed
on the basis of the previous object and where it is passed off, in an ever more
negative way, as non-objective. Philosophy, that is, is concerned to glorify
the thoughtless incapacity of ordinary opinion.
The comparison that is a critical examination looks ahead into the ap­
pearance of phenomenal knowledge; in this comparison, not only does the
natural knowledge of the object (a knowledge presumed to be uniquely and
genuinely true) fail to stand

finn, but also the object itself relinquishes its

standing as the criterion for critically examining. In the critical examina­
tion which is as consciousness itself, neither the examined nor the criterion
passes the examination. Neither stands up before what has arisen in the
meantime in the examination itself.

The fourteenth paragraph

begins with the sentence: "This

dialectical move­

ment which consciousness executes on itself - on its knowledge as well as
on its object - in the sense that out of it the new and true object arises,
is precisely what is termed experience." What is Hegel naming with the
word "experience"? I le is naming the being of beings. Beings, meanwhile,
have become subjects and, along with subjects, have become objects and
the objective. Since antiquity, being has meant: presencing. The mode in
which consciousness (that which

is out of being known) comes to presence

is appearance. As the being that it is, consciousness is phenomenal knowl­
edge. With the term "experience" Hegel names phenomena as phenomena,
the ov � ov. In the word "experience," that � is thought. It is on the basis of
the � (qua, as) that beings are thought in their beingness. Experience is now
no longer the name of a kind of knowledge. Experience is now the word
of being, of being that is perceived by beings as beings. Experience gives
a name to the subjectity of the subject. Experience says what the "being-"
in "being-conscious," in consciousness, means; in fact, only on the basis of
this "being-" doe.c; it become clear and binding what remains to he thought
in the word "-conscious."
The strange word "experience" as the name for the being of beings falls

[foOt ein]

into our consideration because it' has come due

here, admittedly falls outside

[fo//ig].

Its use

[follt hen1t1s] the ordinary as well as the philo­

sophical usage. But it drops [fo//t] like the fruit of the very thing in whose

1 35

O F F T i l E B EATEN TRACK

presence Hegel's thinking has persevered. The justification of this usage,
which is essentially different from a mere manner of speaking, lies in what
I lege) has brought into view in the previous paragraphs about the nature of
consciousness. The three statements about consciousness outline the basic
structure of this nature.
"Consciousness, however, is for itself its own

c011cept."

"Consciousness furnishes its own criterion in it itself."
"Consciousness critically examines itself."

In one respect, the second statement is an explication of the first: it says
that "its own concept," in which consciousness conceives of itselfin its truth,
is the measure on the route of self-conceiving and that this measure falls,
along with what is measured, within consciousness. The third statement
points in the direction of the originary unity of measure and what is mea­
sured: consciousness essences as this unity in that it itself is the comparison
that critically examines, a comparing out ofwhich the two come forth along
with the appearance of phenomena. The essence of appearance is experi­
ence. "Experience" must now retain the meaning which it gained from this
reference to the nature of consciousness.

In

the preceding comments, however, something emerged from those

three statements that has needed to be made explicit all along, since it is in
its own way unavoidable. It is not until the paragraph in which the decisive
word "experience" comes that Hegel expresses it explicitly. The verbs in all
three sentences arc ambiguous: the "is" in the first statement, the "furnishes"
in the second, and the "critically examines" in the third.
Consciousness is for itself its own concept, and at the same time it is
not. It is its own concept in such a way that the concept comes to be for
consciousness and that consciousness finds itself in the concept.
Consciousness furnishes its own criterion in it itself, and at the same
time it does not. It does, in that the truth of consciousness comes out of
consciousness itself, which arrives in its appearance as absolute certainty. It
does not, in that it repeatedly withholds the criterion, which (as the object
that at any particular moment is not true) never stands firm; as a result
consciouo;ness, as it were, hushes it up.
Consciousness critically examines itself, and then again it does not. lt does
examine itself critically in that it is what it is as a result of the comparison
of objectivity and object. It does not, in that natural consciousness insists
on its own opinion and passes off, unexamined, what is true for it as the
absolutely true.

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERI ENCE

In this ambiguity, consciousness betrays the fundamental trait of its
essence: at the same time, to be already that which it is not yet. Being in the
sense of being-conscious, consciousness, means: to reside in the not-yet of
the already, and to do this in such a way that this already presences in the
not-yet. This presence is in itself a self-referral into the already. It sets off on
the path to the already. It makes itself a path
ness consists in the fact that it moves on
which Hegel

[Weg]. The being of conscious­
a path [sich be-u,egt]. The being

thinks as experience has the fundamental trait of movement.

Hegel starts that sentence which expresses the essence of experience with
the words: "This

dialectical movement . . . is

precisely what is termed expe­

rience" - experience, that is, taken here as reflecting on what the science of
phenomenal knowledge presents. It would be the grossest misreading of the
text if we thought that Hegel described the presentation as a sort of experi­
ence only in order to emphasize that it must keep to the phenomena and be
on its guard lest it degenerate into a construction. The experience that we
must think here is not part of the presentation as a description of its nature;
rather, the presentation is part of the essence of experience. Experience is
the appearance of phenomena which appear as such. The presentation of
appearance is part of appearance; it is part of appearance as it is part of the
movement in which consciousness realizes its reality.
Hegel stresses his word for this movement: "dialectical." However, he
uses the term only here, offering no comment on it in the preceding or sub­
sequent paragraphs of the piece. Accordingly, we will attempt to understand
the dialectical on the basis of what emerged from our previous reflections
on the nature of consciousness. One might have thought of explaining the
dialectical on the basis of the unity of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, or
on the basis of the negation of negation. However, everything that is in any
way thetic has its essence in consciousness, in which negativity, too, has its
ground, if negativity is understood on the basis of negation. However, the
essence of consciousness ought to be determined only by how its nature un­
folds. Likewise, we can leave aside whether the dialectic is only a method of
knowledge or whether it belongs in the objectively real as itself something
real. That problem is just a sham-problem so long as it remains undeter­
mined what the reality of the real consists in, to what extent this reality is
based in the being of consciousness, and what is going on with this being.
Discussions about dialectic are like trying to explain a rushing fountain in
terms of the stagnant water in a sewer. Probably the way to the fountain is
still quite far. Nonetheless, we are going to try to point in its direction by
enlisting I legel's help.

Consciousness, as consciousness, is the movement of consciousness, for
it is the comparison between onridpre-ontological knowledge and ontolo­
gical knowledge. The fanner exerts its claim on the latter. The latter claims
that it is the truth of the fonner. Between (Sta) the one and the other is the
articulation of these claims, a i\eyeiV. ln this dialogue, consciousness ascribes

Stai\eyetv is a Stai\Eyea6at. However, the dialogue does
not stand still in 011e shape of consciousness. As the dialogue that it is, it
goes through (Sta) the entire realm of the shapes of consciousness. In this
truth to itself. The

movement of going-through, it gathers itself into the truth of its essence.

Stai\eyetv, thoroughgoing gathering, is a self-gathering (Stai\eyea6at).
Consciousness is consciousness in that it is the dialogue9 between natural
and real knowledge, a dialogue that accomplishes the gathering of its essence
through its shapes. Since the formation of consciousness takes place at once
as both the self-gathering dialogue

and the

self-expressing gathering, the

movement of consciousness is dialectical.
It is only on the basis of the dialogical character of antic-ontological
consciousness that the thetic character of representation-by-consciousness
is brought out; for this reason, characterizing the dialectic by the unity of
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis is still correct but still only derivative. The
same is true of the interpretation of the dialectic as in-finite negativity. This
negativity is grounded upon the self-gathering through the dialogue shapes
of consciousness, a self-gathering unto the absolute concept, which is what
consciousness in its accomplished truth is. Both the quality of being thetic
(that is, positional) and the negating negativity presuppose the originary
dialectical appearance of consciousness, but they never constitute the struc­
ture of the nature of consciousness. The dialectical cannot be explained
logically, in terms of positing or negating by representation, nor can it be
established ontically as a special activity and form of movement within real
consciousness. As the mode of appearance, the dialectical is part of being
which unfolds out of presence as the beingness of beings. Hegel does not
conceive of experience dialectically; rather, he thinks the dialectical on the
basis of the essence of experience. Experience is the beingness of beings,
which is determined as s11hiectum on the basis of subjectity.
The decisive moment in the essence of experience is when the new, true
object arises in it for consciousness. The crucial matter is that the new object
arises as truth arises; it is not crucial that notice is taken of an object

as what arises as the truth of consciousness, as opposed to the old object in

Erfohren, is what suffices to gain its attainment [das auslangend-erlangende

phenomenal consciousness presences

as

with itself. Experience gathers consciousness into the gathering of its own
essence.
Experience is the mode of the presentness of the presences which essences
in self-re-presentation. This new object that arises for consciousness at
whatever point in the history of the formation of consciousness is not just
any true thing, any being, but rather the truth ofthe true, the being of beings,
the appearance of phenomena, experience. According to the concluding
sentence of the fourteenth paragraph, the new object is nothing other than
experience itself.
The

essentia of the ens in its esse is presence. Presence, however, essences

in the mode of presentation. However, since in the meantime the

subiectum,

has become the

res cogitans,

ens,

the

presentation is also intrinsically re­

presenting, i.e., representation. It is not until I Iegel thinks into the word
"experience" that what the res cogitans is,

as

the subiectum co-agitans, finds ex­

pres.c;ion. Experience is the presentation of the absolute subject that essences
in representation and so is the self-absolving absolute subject. Experience
is the subjectity of the absolute subject. As the presentation of absolute rep­
resentation, experience is the parousia of the absolute. Experience is the
absoluteness of the absolute; it appears in the absolving appearing-to-itself.
Everything depends on thinking experience, as it is given here, as the be­
ing of consciousness. However, being means presence. Presence manifests
itself as appearance. Appearance is now the appearance of knowledge. In
being (and it is as being that experience is essentially present) there is, as

1 39

OFF Ti lE B F.ATF.N TRACK

the character of appearance, representation in the sense of presentation.
Even when he uses the word "experience" in the conventional sense of em­
piricism, Hegel is above all attentive to the moment of presence in it. He,
then, understands by experience "attentiveness to the immediately present
as such" (see the "Preface" to The Phenomenology). Hegel is very careful
not to say merely that experience is paying attention to the immediately
present, but rather that it is paying attention to the immediately present in
its presence.
Experience is concerned with what presences in its presence. However,
since consciousness exists by critically examining itself, it departs for its
presence in order to arrive at it. It is part of the appearance of phenomenal
knowledge that such knowledge represents itselfin its presence, i.e., presents
itself. The presentation is part of experience, in fact it is an essential part
of experience. It is not merely a counterpart to experience which might
perhaps be absent. This is the reason that experience is not thought in its
full essence as the beingness of beings in the sense of the absolute subject
until the mode comes to light in which the presentation of phenomenal
knowledge belongs to appearance as such. The penultimate paragraph of
the introduction takes this last step into the essence of experience as the
existence of the absolute.

The fifteenth paragraph takes as its starting point the representation which
natural consciousness has of what is called experience. This representation
runs contrary to experience as I -Iegel thinks it. This means: experience,
thought metaphysically, remains inaccessible to natural consciousness. It is
the beingness of beings, which is to say that it is not found anywhere among
beings as an extant resource. When we are having a good experience with
an object, for example in using a tool, we have the experience in connection
with another object to which the first object (the one with which we are
having the experience) is applied. When we are having a bad experience
with a person, we have the experience on specific occasions, in a situation,
and in relationships in which that person was to have proved himself or
herself. Our experience with an object is not something we have with it, but
rather with some other object which we produce and become involved with.
In ordinary experience (experin), we see the object to be critically examined
under the conditions that obtain when it has been placed by other objects.
What is going on with the object is a result of these other objects. When it
is necessary to change the representations that we had previously had of the
object to be examined, the difference the change requires comes to us from

IIEG EL'S COI':CEPT O F F.XPF.RIENCE

the newly introduced objects. The untruth of the old object is demonstrated
by the new object which we at once represent in order to set it, just as we
have represented it, into a comparative relation with the already known
object with which we are planning to have the experience. However, it is
exactly the other way round within the experience as which consciousness
itself is.
If we represent the objectivity of an object, the truth of something true,
this experience is had in connection with the old object, and it is had in such a
way that the new object, objectivity, arises precisely because ofits connection
with the old object. In connection with the old object and out of it, the new
object is lifted into its status. The important thing is not merely not to
move away [wegzugehenJ toward some other object immediately at hand,
but rather to be responsive [einzugehmJ, for the first time, specifically to
the old object. Natural consciousness represents what it represents and also
its representation immediately and as beings, but without paying attention
to being, which it wiU also have represented in the process. If, therefore,
it is to become aware of the being of beings, it must not remain merely
among beings, but rather engage [eingehmJ with them in such a way that
it goes back [zttriickgehtJ explicitly to that which, in the representation of
beings, was already implicit for it in representedness. If the appearance
of phenomena comes to light, then consciousness in certain respects has
already abandoned ordinary representation and has returned itself, and thus
turned itself around, from phenomena to appearance.
In the appearing-to-it'ielfof appearance, there prevails a "reversal of con­
sciousness itself." The fundamental trait of the experience of consciousness
is this reversal. It is even "our doing, what we contribute." What presents
itself, at this reversal, to consciousnes.'i is not "for consciousness," not, that
is, for natural consciousness. What presents itself in the reversal is not "for
consciousness" which "we contemplate" but rather "for us," we who are
contemplating. Who is this "we"?
"We" are the ones who, in the reversing of natural consciousness, leave
that consciousness to its opinions, but at the same time explicitly look at [se­
hen auj] the appearance of the phenomena. This seeing [SehenJ that specif­
ically watches appearance is the watching [ZusehenJ which is how skepsis
takes place - skepsis which had in mind [vorgesehm aufl the absoluteness
of the absolute and equipped itself [sich versehen] in advance with it. What
comes to appearance in thoroughgoing skepticism shows itself "for us," i.e.,
for those who, thinking of the beingness of beings, are already provided with
being. The reversal of consciousness that prevails in skepsis is the viatica}

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

journey [ Ver.rehgnng] along which consciousness provides itself [sich vn:rieht]
with appearance itself. That which shows itself to those who have been
thus equipped, is indeed part of consciousness itself, as regards its content,
and is "for consciousness." However, the mode in which phenomena show
themselves (namely as appearance) is the mien, the look, of phenomena,
their elSos, which fonns all phenomena, places them in view, and shapes
them; it is the J..IOPc!>TJ, the forma. Hegel calls this the "formal character."
This is never "for consciousness," that is, for natural consciousness which
represents immediately. Insofar as the formal character is for consciousness,
it is always for it as an object only, never as objectivity. The formal charac­
ter, the beingness of beings, is "for us," we who in the reversal do not see
right to the phenomena, but rather to the appearance of the phenomena.
The reversal of consciousness, which is a reversal of representation, does
not turn off from this rash representation onto a byway, but rather from
within natural representation it engages with that which alone entitles rash
representation to what it perceives as presencing.
In the reversal of consciousness we are engaged with something which
natural consciousness does not discover. We look at what "takes place, as
it were, behind its back." The reversal is also part of this. Through it the
appearance of phenomena comes to be presented. The reversal alone turns
experience around and puts it into the presentation. The experience of
consciousness "is lifted into a scientific route" through the reversal. The
presentation represents the being of beings. It is the science of the ov � ov.
The reversal, in which watching turns itself toward the phenomena as phe­
nomenal, brings seeing onto the route which science goes. Skepsis at the
being of beings restores beings to themselves, so that they show themselves
as beings in that "as." The reversal specifically pennits the � to occur in
relation to the ov. Thus, what is decisive in the experience through which
consciousness appears to itself in its appearance lies with the reversal. This,
however, is "our doing, what we contribute."
I Iowever, did not l legel use all his reflecting in the preceding paragraphs
(cf., in particular, the twelfth) to show that in the presentation of phenome­
nal knowledge we should leave aside precisely all our fancies and thoughts,
so that what remained to us was "purely to watch"? Does he not explicitly
say in the thirteenth paragraph that consciousness critically examines itself
and that therefore any "addition of ours" would be superfluous? By leaving
aside all our contributions we are supposed to reach the point where the
phenomena, of their own accord, show themselves in their appearance. But
this relinquishing, this letting-go, does not look after itself. Ifletting is ever

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXP E R I E!':CE

an activity, then this is, this letting-go. This activity is necessarily the activity
that we contribute. For it is only if the skepsis of thoroughgoing skepticism
has in mind the being of beings that beings can freely appear of their own
accord and let their appearance appear. The contribution of the reversal of
consciousness is to let phenomena appear as such. The contribution does
not force something upon experience which is foreign to it. Rather, it ex­
plicitly brings forth from it only what lies in it as the being of consciousness,
which (according to the first statement of consciousness) is for itself its own
concept. Hence the contribution

can

also never sublate

[aujbeben]

the pure

watching that is necessary for the presentation. Rather, in the contribu­
tion and through it, pure watching begins

[hebt an] . Therefore,

watching

continues in the contribution.

In the previous paragraph, Hegel states that experience is the movement

which consciousness itself executes on itself. This execution is the prevailing
of the force

[U'll/ten

der

Gezvalt)

which, as the will of the absolute, wills

that the absolute come to presence in its absoluteness with us. The will
as which the absolute is prevails in the mode of experience. This is what
suffices to gain its attainment

[das auslangend-erlangende Ge/angen] , which,

as appearance, appears to itself. A"" this attainment (presence), experience
characterizes the essence of the will, whose essence conceals itself with
the essence of experience in the essence of being. The experience to be
thought here is neither a mode of knowledge nor a mode of willing as
it is usually represented. The will of the absolute to be with us, i.e., to
appear for us as phenomena, prevails as experience. For us, the phenomena
present themselves in their appearance, if we make the contribution of our
reversal. Accordingly, the contribution wills the will of the absolute. The
contribution itself is what the absoluteness of the absolute wills. There is
nothing selfish on our part that is added to the absolute by the reversal of
consciousness. The reversal restores us into our essence, which is to presence
in the parousia of the absolute. This means, for us: to present the parousia.
The presentation of experience is willed out of the essence of experience
as something belonging to experience. \Vhen we watch, our contribution
brings to light that we are, and how we are, kin to the absoluteness of the
absolute.
Experience is the being of beings. Beings, meanwhile, have appeared in
the character of consciousness; in representation, they

are as phenomena.

But if the presentation is part of the essence of experience; if the presen­
tation is grounded in the reversal; and if the reversal, as our contribution,
is the carrying out of our essential relationship to the absoluteness of the

1 43

OFF Ti lE B EATE� TRACK

absolute;

then our essence itself is pm-r of the parousin of the absolute.

The re­

versal is the skepsis into absoluteness. It reverse.-; all phenomena in their
appearance. By providing itself in advance with appearance, it overtakes
all phenomena as such, envelops [u11if1ingt) them, and opens the expanse

[ Umfong] of the site in which

appearance appears to itself. Within this site,

and through it, the presentation takes its route by constantly, skeptically,
preceding itself. In the reversal, the presentation has the absoluteness of
the absolute before itself and so it has the absolute with itself. The reversal
opens and encloses the site of the historical formation of consciousness.
In this way it secures the completeness and the progress of the experience
of consciousness. Experience proceeds by preceding itself, by returning to
itself in this preceding, by unfolding itself into the presence of conscious­
ness in this return to itself, by becoming

constant

as this presence. The

absolved, constant presence of consciousness is the being of the absolute.
Through the reversal, phenomenal consciousness shows itself in its appear­
ance, and only in its appearance. The phenomena externalize themselves
in their appearance.

In this self-externalizing [Entihlj.lmmg) , consciousness

goes out into the farthest reaches

[Atiflerste]

of its being. However, it goes

away neither from itself nor from its essence; nor does the absolute, in the
externali7.ation, sink into a void of its own debility. Extemalization, rather, is
the self-maintaining of the fullness of appearance out of the strength of the
will, which is the mode in which the parousia of the absolute prevails. The
externalization of the absolute is its internalization, its recollection, into the
route of the appearance ofits absoluteness. Externalization is far from being
an alienation into abstraction; in fact, it is precisely through extemali7.ation
that appearance comes to be at home in phenomena as such.
Of course it is an entirely different question whether and to what extent
subjectity is a destiny proper to the essence of being, within which the
unconcealedness of being - not the truth of beings - withdraws and thereby
determines an appropriate epoch. Within subjectity, every being as such
becomes an object. All beings are beings from out of and within steadfast
reliability.

In

the age of subjectity, in which the essence of technology is

grounded, if nature as being is put in opposition to consciousness, then this
nature is only another name for beings as the objects of modern technolo­
gical objectification which indiscriminately attacks the continued existence
of things and men.
The first thing the reversal of consciousness does is to open, specifically
and in advance, the interstice or the between (61a) within which the dialogue
between natural consciousness and absolute knowledge is articulated in its

1 44

H EGEL'S CONC EPT OF EXPERIENCE

own language. As skepsis at the absoluteness of the absolute, the reversal
also opens the complete realm across

(61a) which consciousness gathers its

history into the achieved truth and fonns it itself in this way. The reversal
of consciousness illuminates the twofold

61a of the twofold �eyea6m. Be­

forehand and in the first place, the reversal fom1s the essential free space
for the dialectical character of that movement as which experience achieves
itself as the being of consciousnc.'is.
The reversal of consciousness is the carrying out of the seeing of skep­
sis, which sees since it has already provided itself with absoluteness and is
provided with it by absoluteness. The having-seen of skepsis

(vidt)

is the

knowledge of absoluteness. The reversal of consciousness is the essential
center of that knowledge as which the presentation of phenomenal knowl­
edge unfolds itself. Thus, the presentation is the route of consciousness itself
to the appearing-to-itself within appearance. It is "the pathway to science."
The presentation, when it is so conceived as the pathway to science, is itself
science, for the path [Weg] into which it moves [be-·wegt) is movement in the
sense of experience. The force prevailing within and as this experience is
the will of the absolute that wills itself in its parousia. It is within this will
that the path has its necessity.
Hegel summari7.es the results of his reflection, in the fourteenth and
fifteenth paragraphs, on the essence of experience in one sentence, which he
separates from the continuous text of the paragraph into its own paragraph.
Thus the sentence pulls together in one place all the previous paragraphs
of the piece into the decisive thought. It nms:
In virtue of that necessity this pathway to science is itself already scirnce, and is,
moreover, as regards its content, science of the

experimce oj"consdoumess.

If we put the emphasized words together, they give the title which Hegel
originally gave to

The Phenomenolog;y of Spirit:

"Science of the Experience

of Consciousness." The previous paragraphs contain the exegesis (as the
literary tenn is) of this title. Experience is the appearance of phenomenal
knowledge as phenomenal. The science of the experience of consciousness
presents the phenomena as phenomena. The phenomena are the ov, beings
in the sense of consciousness. The skepsis of the presentation 6ewpei TO ov

1 45

OFF THE BEATEJII: TRACK

The pre.'icntation provides itself with the force of the will as which the
absolute wills its presentness (parousia). Aristotle characterizes the contem­
plation of beings as beings as hnaTTJilTJ TIS, a way in which our seeing and
perceiving stands by, that is, stands by what is present as such. As a way of
standing by what is constantly present, the nnaTTJIJTJ is itself a kind ofhuman
presencing among unconcealed presences. We conunit an error when we
translate hnaTTJIJTJ as "science" and make it hostage to whatever happens to
be known by that term at a given time. When we translate FrrlaTTJIJTJ here as
science, the only justification for this interpretation is that we understand
knowledge as having-seen and think having-seen on the basis of that seeing
which stands before the look of what presences as such and looks at present­
ness itself. When knowledge is thought in this way, then the ETTIGTTJ IJTJ TIS
of Aristotle retains - and not coincidentally - an essential relation to what
Hegel calls "science," the knowledge of which, however, has changed with
the change in the presence of what presences. If we understand the word
"science" in this sense alone, then what are usually called the sciences are
science only secondarily. The sciences are fundamentally philosophy, but
they arc a philosophy in which they abandon their own ground and establish
themselves, in their own way, in that which philosophy has made open to
them. This is the realm of TEXVTJ.
Aristotle calls this science he characterized (the science which inspects
beings as beings) "first philosophy." However, not only does it observe
beings in their bcingness, but it also, at the same time, observes that being
which corresponds purely to beingness, the highest being. This particular
being, TO 6eiov, the divine, is also called - in a strange ambiguity - "being"
itself. As ontology, first philosophy is also the theology of true beings. It
would be more accurate to call it tl1eiology. The science of beings as such
is intrinsically onto-theological.
Accordingly, Hegel calls the presentation of phenomenal knowledge not
the science of the experience of consciousness, but rather "science." That
presentation is only a part of science. That is why "Part One" explicitly
comes above the title "Science of the Experience of Consciousness." The
science of the experience of consciousness points within itself to the other
part of science. In the hierarchy, the second part is no more subordinate to
the first than theology is to ontology within first philosophy. But neither
docs it take precedence. Nor are the two ranked equal to each other. The
two, each in its own way, are the same. Talking about a first and a second
part remains extrinsic, but not accidental, since from Plato and Aristotle
to Nietz.'iche the ground of the unity of the onto-theological essence of

HEGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIF.NO:

metaphysics has remained so hidden that it has not even been inquired into.
Instead, the ranks of ontology and theology fluctuate reciprocally depend­
ing on whether one or the other is seen as the very first and genuine science
within first philosophy. For Hegel, the science of the experience of con­
sciousness, i.e., the ontology of true beings in their existence, points to the
other part of science as "genuine science."

The sixteenth paragraph,

with which the piece comes to an end, opens a

prospect onto this connection between the two parts of science. However,
that connection shows itself only if we keep it in view that experience is the
beingness of beings, which come to presence as consciousness in the shapes
ofconsciousness. Already for Greek thinkers, ever since the ov arose as cf>valS,

ov, is cf>aivea6al: appearance
that shows itself. Accordingly, the manifoldness of what presences (TO: oVTa)

the presentness of presences, the ovaia of the

is thought as that which is simply taken and accepted

[auf- u11d angenO'mmen]

in its appearance: TCx SoKoOVTa. The 86�a takes and accepts immediately that
which presences.
accepts

voeiv, on the other hand, is a perceiving [ Vernehmen] which

[annimmt]

what presences as such and undertakes

regard to its presence. Since the

[vornimmt]

it in

ov, that which presences, has a double

signification as both that which itself presences as well as the presencing,
the ov stands in an essentially necessary and equiprimordial relation to voeiv
and

56�a.

The being of what is known in certainty also has the essential trait of
presence. It essences as appearance. However, in the presencing of knowl­
edge, i.e., of the
longer the

idea

subiectum in

the sense of the

showing itself as

res cogitans, appearance is no

elSos, but rather as perceptio. Appearance

is now presence in the mode of the presentation within the realm of rep­
resentation. The appearance of phenomenal knowledge is the immediate
presencing of consciousness. However, this presencing essences in the mode
of experience. With experience, the absolute, spirit, arrives into the "whole
realm of the truth of spirit." Yet the moments of its truth are the shapes
of consciousness which along the route of experience have laid aside all
the things which seemed to be true at a given time exclusively for natural
consciousness because they, at that point in its history, were exclusively for
it. But when experience is achieved, then the appearance of phenomena
will have arrived into that pure seeming as which the absolute absolutely
presences with itself and is its essence itself. On the basis of this pure seem­
ing, the force prevails which forces consciousness into the movement of
experience. The force of the absolute, the force that prevails in experience,

1 47

OFF TH E B EATEN TRACK

"is pressing consciousness forward to its true existence." Existence means
here presencing in the mode of appearing-to-itself. At this point, the pure
appearance of the absolute coincides with its essence.
The parousia is the presentness in which the absolute is with us and at the
same time is by itself as the absolute. Accordingly, at this point the presen­
tation of appearance also coincides with "the genuine science of spirit." The
science of phenomenal knowledge leads and comes into genuine science.
Genuine science makes the presentation of how the absolute presences to
itself in its absoluteness. Genuine science is the "science oflogic." The word
is taken from tradition. Logic is taken to be the knowledge of the concept.
The concept, however, by which consciousness is for itself its own concept,
now refers to the absolute self-conceiving of the absolute in its being seized
absolutely by itself. The logic of the concept is the ontological theiology
of the absolute. It docs not, like the science of the experience of conscious­
ness, present the parousia of the absolute, but rather the absoluteness in its
parousia to itself.
In the tide "Science of the Experience of Consciousness," the word "ex­
perience" is emphasized in the center. It mediates between consciousness
and science. In this respect, what is said by the title corresponds to the
subject matter. As the being of consciousness, experience is in itself the re­
versal through which consciousness presents itself in its appearance. Which
means: experience, in presenting, is science. Yet natural representation un­
derstands the mediating tide immediately, and only in the sense that science
has as its object experience, which in its turn is the experience of conscious­
ness. But this title heads a work that performs the reversal of consciousness
by presenting it. The reversal reverses natural consciousness. For this rea­
son, the title has not been understood while it is read according to the habit
of natural consciousness. The two genitives "of the experience" and "of
consciousness" are not objective genitives but subjective genitives. Con­
sciousness, not science, is the subject that is in the mode of experience. And
experience is really the subject of science. On the other hand, it is not to
be denied that the objective genitives retain their sense, though they do
so only because the subjective genitive is true. Thought rigorously, neither
takes precedence over the other. They both refer to the subject-object rela­
tionship of the absolute subject in its subjectity. In view of that relationship,
which has its essence in experience, we must always think the tide at once
both backwards and forwards through that mediating word.
In both their meanings, the genitives identify the relation which the re­
versal makes usc of, without ever explicitly thinking it: the relation of being

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERIENCE

to beings as the relation ofbeings to being. The dialectical movement estab­
lishes itself in the site which, though it is opened by the reversal, is concealed
precisely as the openness of that relation. The skeptical dialogue between
natural and absolute consciousness looks through
previewing

[im Vorblick]

[durchb/ickt]

this site in

the absoluteness of the absolute. The dialectical

skepsis is the essence of philosophy. The genitives that enter into the title
are neither exclusively subjective nor exclusively objective, and certainly no
mere coupling of the two. They are the dialectical-speculative genitive. This
genitive shows itself in the title only because it has already dominated from
the start the language in which the experience of consciousness is articulated
as it achieves its presentation.
The title Hegel chose at first - " Science of the

Expe·rience of Conscious­

ness" - was dropped during the printing of the work, but the piece that
explains it remains. The title was replaced by another one: "Science of the
Phenomenology of Spirit." As a result, only the remaining piece - which
nowhere mentions a phenomenology of spirit - correctly interprets the new
title. This new title appeared as part of the complete title of the work as
it was published in

r 8o7:

"System of Science Part I, The Phenomenology

of Spirit." When the work was reprinted shortly after Hegel's death as the
second volume of the

Collected Works (r 8p),

the title was merely: "Phe­

nomenology of Spirit." Behind this subtle dropping of the article there is
hidden a decisive change in I legel's thinking and in the way he commu­
nicates his thinking. As regards content, the change affects the system; as
regards time, it begins shortly after the publication of the Science of the
PhenomenobJ!{Y ofSpirit. Presumably, it was motivated and confirmed by his
switch to teaching in the Nuremberg Gymnasium. The school lessons he de­
livered here also influenced his teaching at the university, which he resumed
later.
At the time of the initial publication of

The PhenommobJ!{Y of Spirit, the

complete title " System of Science" has a dialectical-speculative ambiguity.
It docs not mean: the sciences classified according to a carefully reasoned
order. Neither docs it mean: philosophy presented as a coherent science.
"System of Science" means: science is intrinsically the absolute organization
of the absoluteness of the absolute. The subjectity of the subject essences
in such a way that it knows ito;elf and arranges itself into the completeness
of ito; structure. This self-arranging is the inode of being in which subjec­
tity is. "System" is the assembly of the absolute which gathers itself into
its absoluteness and by this gathered stance is made steadfast into its own

1 49

OFF Ti l E B EATE� TRACK

presence. Science is the subject of the system, not its object. However, it
is the subject in such a way that science, part of subjectity, participates in
constituting the absoluteness of the absolute. For Hegel around the time
of the first publication of The

Phenomenology of Spirit, science

is the onto­

theiological knowledge of true beings as beings. Science unfolds in its en­
tirety in a twofold way, into the "science of the phenomenology of spirit,"
and into the "science of logic." Hegel's "science of logic" at this time is
absolute theiology and not ontology. On the contrary, ontology unfolds
as the "science of the experience of consciousness." Phenomenology is the
"first science," and logic is the genuine science within first philosophy as the
truth of beings as such. This truth is the essence of metaphysics. However,
no more than Kant before him and the later Schelling after him is Hegel
able to master the power long-entrenched in the didactic systematizing of
academic metaphysics. Nietzsche rails against this systematizing only be­
cause his thinking must remain in the essential, onto-theiological system of
metaphysics.
Why did Hegel abandon the title he had chosen at first, "Science of the

Experience of Consciousness"? We do not know. We may, however, conjec­
ture. Did he shrink from the word "experience" which he himself empha­
sized and put at the center? Now this term names the being of beings. For
Kant, it is the term that designates the only possible theoretical knowledge
of beings. Did it seem too daring to make the original meaning of the word
"experience," which we may presume was echoing in his thoughtful ear,

[auslangendes
the mode of presence, of elva•, of

resound again: experience as the sufficing toward attainment

Gelangen], and attainment,

in its

tum,

as

being? Did it seem too daring to raise this ancient sound as the keynote of
the language in which the work speak'>, even when the word "experience"
does not occur? At all the essential passages

en route,

in the transitions,

it does occur. It does, admittedly, recede in the last main section, which
presents the appearance of consciousness as spirit. On the other hand, the
preface, written after the completion of the work, still speaks of the "system
of the experience of spirit."
Nonetheless, the heading "Science of the

Experience of Consciousness"

disappears. The word "consciousness," too, disappears along with it from
the title of the work, even though consciousness as self-consciousness con­
stitutes the essential realm of the absoluteness of the absolute, even though
consciousness is the new land of modern metaphysics, a land which has
now been taken possession of as the "system of science" and has been fully
surveyed.

H EGEL'S COl':CEPT OF EXPERIE:\'CE

The heading "Science of the Expet·ience of Consciousness" disappears
in favor of the new heading: "Science of the Phenomenology of Spirit."
The new one is constructed in a rigorous correspondence to the old.
We must think its genitive likewise as dialectical-speculative. The word
"phenomenology," which was already commonly used in academic phi­
losophy at the time, takes the place of the word "experience." The esse'TICe
of expet-imce is the essmce ofphmomenoloffY. The ct>alvecr6at, the appearing­
to-itself of the absolute subject, which is called "spirit," gathers itself in
the mode of a dialogue between on tic and ontological consciousness. The
"-logy" in "phenomenology" is the Myecr6aa in the sense of the ambigu­
ous S1aAEyecr6a1, which characterizes the movement by which the expe­
rience of consciousness is the being of being-conscious, consciousness.
Phenomenology is the self-gathering of the talk of the dialogue of spirit
with its parousia. Phenomenology, here, is the term for the existence of
spirit. Spirit is the subject of phenomenology, not its object. The word,
here, neither means a discipline of philosophy, nor is it a designation for
a specialized kind of research whose concern is to describe what is given.
However, because the self-gathering of the absolute into its parousia de­
mands (in keeping with its essence) to be presented, it has already been de­
termined from within the essence of phenomenology that phenomenology
be science; not, however, because it is a representation of spirit, but rather
because it is the existence, the presentnes.o; of spirit. Thus the abridged tide
"The Phenomenology of Spirit," thought correctly, does not fall away into
vague indeterminacy. It compels thinking into the last possible recollection.
"The Phenomenology of Spirit" means: the parousia of the absolute in its
prevailing. A decade after the publication of The Phen0111enololfY of Spirit,
"phenomenology" has declined into a narrowly circumscribed part of the
philosophy of spirit within the academic system of the Rnryclopedia ( I 8 I 7).
Ao; it was in the eighteenth century, the name "phenomenology" again be­
comes the name for a discipline. It is found between anthropology and
psychology.
But what is the phenomenology of spirit, if it is the experience of con­
sciousness? It is thoroughgoing skepticism. Experience is the dialogue be­
tween natural consciousness and absolute knowledge. Natural conscious­
ness is the historically existing spirit extant in its time. This spirit, however,
is not ideology. As subjectity, it is the reality of the real. At each time, a his­
torical spirit is always internalized, recollected, in itself to itself. Absolute
knowledge, however, is the presentation of the appearance of the exist­
ing spirit. It achieves the "organization" of the structure of the being of the

OFF THE BEATJ<:;-..' TRACK

spiritual realm. The route of the dialogue is gathered into the site which the
dialogue enacts (reaches) in its route only in order that, in passing through
the site, it establishes itself in it, and, arriving there, comes to presence. The
route of arrival of the talk is the path of despair, along which consciousness
each time loses its not-yet-true, sacrificing it for truth to appear. At the
consummation of the dialogue by thoroughgoing skepticism, the utterance
comes: it is finished. It comes at that place along the path where conscious­
ness itself dies the death into which it has been tom by the power of the
absolute. At the conclusion of his work, Hegel calls the phenomenology of
the spirit "the Golgotha of absolute spirit."
The science of the phenomenology ofspirit is the theology of the absolute
as regards its parousia within a dialectical-speculative Good Friday. The
absolute dies here. God is dead. This means everything except that there is
no god. The "science of logic," in contrast, is the science of the absolute
which comes to pre.c;ence originally with itself in its self-knowledge as the
absolute concept. It is the theology of the absoluteness of the absolute before
creation. Both theologies are ontologies, are secular
the worldliness

[weltlich].

They think

[Weltlicbkeit] of the world, if we take "world" to mean here:

beings in their entirety, beings that have the fundamental trait of subjectity.
The world, understood in this way, detennines its beings so that they arc
present in the representation that represents the absolute. However, the
reason that the science of absolute knowledge is the secular theology of
the world is not that it secularizes Christian and ecclesiastical theology but
rather that it is part of the essence of ontology. Ontology is older than every
Christian theology, which for its part must have been effectively real before
a process of secularization could start on it. The theology of the absolute
is the knowledge of beings as beings, which, for Greek thinkers, brings to
light and follows its onto-theiological essence, without ever being able to
follow that essence into its ground. Within the language of absolute science,
it comes to light that Christian theology is - in what it knows and how it
knows what it knows - metaphysics.
The proposition "The experience of consciousness is thoroughgoing
skepticism" and the proposition "Phenomenology is the Golgotha of ab­
solute spirit" join the completion of the work to its beginning. However,
what is essential about

The Phenomenolo[!Ji of Spirit

is not the work as the

accomplishment of a thinker, but the work as the reality of consciousness
itself. Because phenomenology is experience, the beingness of beings, it is
therefore the gathering of the appearing-to-itself upon the appearance out
of the seeming of the absolute.

I I F.GEL'S CONC EPT OF EXPE RIENCE

The gathering self-recollection, however, is the implicit essence of the
will. The will wills itself in the parousia of the absolute with us. Phenomen­
ology is itself being, in the mode of which the absolute in and for itself is
with us. This being wills, since will is its essence. It remains to consider how
being has arrived at its essence.
"Tc1 be with us" is part of the absoluteness of the absolute. \Vithout this
"with us," the absolute would be the solitary one; it would not be able to
appear to itself among phenomena. It could not rise into its unconcealed­
ness. \Vith this rise (ct>va1s), it would not be with life (�oof}). Experience is
the movement of the dialogue between natural and absolute knowledge. It
is both of them, as the uniting unity by which it gathers. It is the nature of
natural consciousness, which is historical in the accident of the shapes in
which it appears. It is the self-comprehending of these shapes in the organ­
ization of their appearance. The book, therefore, reaches its conclusion in
the sentence: "Both together - history (intellectually) comprehended - form
at once the recollection and the Golgotha of absolute spirit, the reality, the
truth, the certainty of its throne, without which it would be lifeless, soli­
tary, and alone." In its absoluteness, the absolute requires the throne as the
height in which it is sedent but not abased.
The parousia of the absolute takes place as phenomenology. Experience
is being, and in accordance with it the absolute wills to be with us. Since
the presentation that essentially belongs to experience has nothing else to
present hut phenomenology in the sense of the parousia, already at the
end of the first paragraph at the beginning there is named that in which
the work ends: parousia. It is true that this parousia - the fact that the
absolute is already in and for itself with us and wiiJs this - is mentioned only
inconspicuously in a subordinate clause. At the culmination of the work,
the subordinate clause is turned into a single main clause. The "with us"
has unveiled itself as "not without us."
In the "with us" at the beginning of the piece, the essence of "us" is still
unthought. In the "not without us" at the end of the work, the essence of
"us" has been determined. We are the ones who are attentive, skeptically,
to the being of beings specifically, and in this way genuinely attend to it.
The circle closes. The last words of the work, like an echo, lose them­
selves in the beginning. 'lbc sixteen paragraphs of the piece, usually called
the "Introduction to The Phenomenology of Spirit," arc already the genuine
beginning of phenomenology.
The heading " Introduction" is not found in the original edition of r 8o7.
Only in the "Table of Contents," which was added later, is the piece that
1 53

OFF THE BEATE!': TRACK

follows the "Preface" given the title " Introduction," perhaps out of embar­
rassment at having no name for it. For the fact of the matter is that the piece
is really not an introduction, which may well he why it was not until the work
was finished that the much more extensive " Preface" was drafted as a prepar­
ative to the work. The sixteen paragraphs of the piece do not constitute an
introduction, because they cannot constitute any such thing. They cannot be
an introduction because there is no introduction to phenomenology. There
is no introduction to phenomenology because there can be no introduction
to phenomenology. The phenomenology of spirit is the parousia of the ab­
solute. Parousia is the being of beings. For men, there is no introduction

[Einleittmg] to the being of beings because the essence of man in the com­
pany [ Geleit] of being is this company it'iclf. Provided that the "to be with
us" of the absolute prevails, we arc already in the parousia. We can never
been escorted from somewhere else into it. Yet how are we in the parousia
of the absolute? We are in it according to the habit of natural consciousness.
Each thing appears to natural consciousness as though all presences were
alongside each other. Even the absolute habitually appears to it as alongside
the rest. Even that which is above or over habitually represented beings is
over against them, for natural consciousness. It is this "alongside" present
in the direction upward that we ourselves are alongside. Following the pull
of its representation, natural consciousness lingers among beings and does
not turn itself toward being, by which nonetheless it is attracted in advance,
and even attracted for that pull toward the being of beings. Nonetheless,
when natural consciousness becomes attentive to being, it assures us that
being is an abstraction. That by which consciousness is attracted into its
own essence is passed off by consciousness as something abstracted. No
greater reversal is possible for natural consciousness than this opinion.
The perversities

[ Verkehrheiten]

of the circumstances in which natural

consciousness roams about pale compared to this reversal

[Verkehnmg].

It

tries to eliminate one perversity through the organization of another, but
without being mindful of the real reversal. This is the reason for the endur­
ing necessity that consciousness turns around from its non-self-turning to
the being of beings and turns itself toward the appearance of phenomena.
Natural consciousness cannot be led into where it already is. However, in
turning around neither must it abandon its stay in the midst of beings. It
must be prepared to accept its residence specifically in its truth.
We could take, literarily, the sixteen paragraphs to be the exegesis of
the title which then was dropped. However, if our thinking is based on the
subject matter, then the book's title does not matter; the work itself does.

1 54

H EGEL'S CONCEPT OF EXPERI E�CE

Or we might even say: not even the work matters, hut rather that which it
presents - experience, phenomenology, as what is essential in the parousia
of the absolute. And then again, the reason it matters is not that we take
note of it, but rather that we ourselves arc in the experience which our being
also is. That is what matters in the old, traditional sense of being: to be a
presence among . . . the presences.
'rhe sixteen paragraphs ofthe piece direct natural consciousness back into
the appropriation of its stay. This redirection occurs by turning conscious­
ness around; through that tum consciousness arrives into the experience
as which the parousia of the absolute truly happens. Natural consciousness
can only be retrieved from its habitual representation and directed into ex­
perience if we start from the representations which natural consciousness
makes (at once and in its own way) out of that which encounters it with
the claim to be absolute knowledge. To start from the opinions of natural
consciousness marks the style and coherence of the paragraphs of the piece.
This piece, the beginning of the actual body of the work, is the beginning
of the skepsis that prevails through thoroughgoing skepticism. 'fl> begin the
skepsis means: to perform the having-seen all the way into the absoluteness
of the absolute and to keep to it there. The text is the ineluctable opportunity
to induce natural consciousness to release within itself the knowledge in
which it already is through being its own concept. Only when the reversal
of consciousness has been carried out in which the appearance of spirit has
turned to us do the phenomena come to presence as phenomena "for us."
"For us" means precisely not "relative to us," representing as we ordinarily
do. "For us" means: "in itself," i.e., appearing out of the absoluteness of the
absolute into the pure site of its appearance.
It is only when this text has induced us to tum around, actually to begin
the presentation, that the presentation of the experience of consciousness
can begin. The presentation begins absolutely with the absoluteness of the
absolute. It begins with the extreme force of the will of the parousia. It
begins with the extreme self-extcmalization of the absolute in it.'i appear­
ance. In order to be able to look ahead into this appearance, we must take
the phenomena as they appear and keep them free from our opinions and
thought about them. Yet this letting the encounter happen, this letting go,
is an activity which takes it.'i certainty and endurance only from our contri­
bution of the reversal. Our reversal is that we go skeptically, i.e., with open
eyes, to encow1ter the appearance of phenomenal consciousness, which has
already come to us in the parousia, in order to be on the route in which
experience is the phenomenology of the absolute.

1 55

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

The presentation begins by letting "sense-certainty" appear absolutely:
The knowledge, which is at the start or immediately our object, can be nothing else
than just that which is immediate knowledge, knowledge of the immediate, of what

is. We have, in dealing with it, to proceed, too, in an immediate way, to accept what
is given, not altering anything in it as it is presented before us, and keeping mere
apprehension free from conceptual comprehension.

Once the presentation of the appearance of sense-certainty has been
carried out, then there arises a new object, which is the being of what
that presentation takes to be true beings, namely the truth of certainty, a
certainty which is self-consciousness that knows ito;elf. The presentation of
the appearance of"The Truth Which Conscious Certainty of Self Realizes"
begins with the following sentences:
In the kinds of certainty hitherto considered, the truth for consciousness is some­
thing other than consciousness itself. The conception, however, of this truth vanishes
in the course of our experience of it. What the object immediately was

in itself­

whether mere being in sense-certainty, a concrete thing in perception, or the power
in the case of understanding - it turns out, in truth, not to be this really; but instead,
this in-itself proves to be a way in which it is for an other. The concept of the object
gives way before the actual concrete object, or the first immediate idea is cancelled
in the course of experience. Mere certainty vanished in favor of the truth.

Nietzsche� Word: "God Is Dead"

The following commentary is an attempt to point in the direction where,
perhaps, the question about the essence of nihilism can one day he posed.
The commentary derives from a thinking that is beginning to win an initial
clarity about Nietzsche's fundamental place within the history of Western
metaphysics. To point in this direction clarifies a stage of Western meta­
physics that is in all likelihood its final stage, since metaphysics, through
�ietzsche, has deprived itself of its own essential possibility in certain re­
spects, and therefore to that extent other possibilities of metaphysics can
no longer become apparent. After the metaphysical reversal carried out by
Nietz.'iche, all that is left to metaphysics is to be inverted into the dire state
of its non-essence. The supersensory has become an unenduring product of

[1/erabsetzung] its antithesis, the sensory
denies its own essence. The dismissal [Absetzung] of the supersensory also
the sensory. But by so disparaging

eliminates the purely sensory and with it the difference between the two.
The dismissal of the supersensory ends in a "neither-nor" regarding the
distinction between sensory

(ala61)T6v)

and non-sensory

(vo1)T6v).

It ends

in the senseless. However, it remains the unthinking and insuperable as­
sumption behind blind attempts to evade the senseless through a sheer fiat
of sense.
Throughout the following, metaphysics is thought as the truth of beings
as such in their entirety, not as the doctrine of a thinker. In each instance,
a thinker has his fundamental philosophical position within a metaphysics.
For that reason, a metaphysics can be named after a thinker. In accordance
with the essence of metaphysics as it is thought here, this in no way im­
plies that a particular metaphysics is the acliievement and possession of a
thinker as a personality acting within the public setting of cultural affairs.
The destiny of being makes its way over beings in abrupt epochs of truth;

1 57

OFF Ti l E 8 EATF.N TRACK

in each phase of metaphysics, a particular piece of that way becomes appar­
ent. Nietz.'iche himself interprets the course of Western history metaphysi­
cally, namely as the advent and development of nihilism. To think through
�iet1.sche's metaphysics becomes a matter of reflecting on the situation and
place of contemporary men, whose destiny with respect to truth is still little
experienced. Every such reflection, however, if it is to do more than idly
repeat infonnation, goes beyond that at which reflection is directed.

'Io go

beyond is not, without further ado, to raise higher or even to exceed, nor
is it to overcome at once. To reflect on Niet7�'>che's metaphysics does not
mean that besides his ethics and his epistemology and his aesthetics, we
also, and above all, deal with a metaphysics; rather it means: that we try to
take Niet7-Sche seriously as a thinker. I lowever, even for �ietzsche thinking
means: to represent beings as beings. All metaphysical thinking is onto-logy
or it is nothing at all.
For the reflection that is attempted here, it is a matter of preparing
for a simple and inconspicuous step forward in thought. It is the concern
of preparatory thinking to clear a free scope within which being itself"
would again be able to take man with regard to his essence into an initial
relationship.b To be preparatory is the essence of such thinking.
This essential thinking, essential and therefore everywhere and in every
respect only preparatory, proceeds in inconspicuousness. Here, all fellow
thinking, however clumsy and groping, is an essential help. To share in
thinking is the unobtrusive sowing of sowers: the sowing is not made good
by acknowledgment or profit, and the sowers may never sec blade or fruit
and not know a harvest. They serve the sowing, and even more willingly
they serve the preparation for sowing.
Before sowing comes plowing. It is essential to reclaim the field that
had to remain in obscurity while the land of metaphysics was inescapably
dominant. It is essential first of all to sense, to intuit, this field; then to find
it; and then to cultivate it. It is essential to go out to this field for the first
time. Many arc the paths still unknown. Yet each thinker is allotted only
one way, his own, in the track.o; of which he must go back and forth, time
and again, in order at last to keep to it as his own, though it is never his,
and say what he came to know on this one path.
Perhaps the title

Being and Time is the signpost of such a way. In

keep­

ing with the essential involvement of metaphysics (an involvement that

:-.J I ETZSCI IE'S WOR D : "GOD IS D EAD"

metaphysics itself demands and seeks anew time and again) with the sci­
ences, themselves the offspring of metaphysics, preparatory thinking must
also move now and then in the area of the sciences because in many dif­
ferent shapes they are claiming still to predetennine the fundamental form
of knowledge and the knowable, either knowingly or through the nature of
their validity and effectiveness. The more plainly the sciences arc carried
along by their predetermined technological essence and its characteristic
forn1, the more definitely the question is resolved about the epistemologi­
cal possibility claimed in technology, about the nature, limits, and rights of
this possibility for knowledge.
To think preparatorily and to fulfill such thinking involves an education
in thinking in the midst of the sciences. For this, the difficult thing is to
find an appropriate form so that this education in thinking is not liable to
be confused with research and erudition. This goal is in danger above all
when thinking must, simultaneously and perpetually, first of all find its own
place to stay. 'Ia think in the midst of the sciences means: to go past them
without despising them.
We do not know what possibilities the destiny of Western history still has
in store for our people and the West. �or is the external organization and
arrangement of these possibilities what is necessary in the first instance.
What is important is only that learners in thinking are fellow learners fellow learners who in their own way stay on the path and are present at the
right moment.
The following commentary, in its intention and consequence, keeps to
the area of the one experience out of which Being and Time is thought.
This thinking has been concerned constantly with one occurrence: that
in the history of Western thinking, right from the beginning, beings have
been thought in regard to being, but the truth of being has remained un­
thought. Indeed, not only has the truth of being been denied to thinking as
a possible experience, but Western thinking itself (precisely in the fonn of
metaphysics) has specifically, though unknowingly, masked the occurrence
of this dcnial.3
Preparatory thinking therefore necessarily keeps to the realm of his­
torical reflection. For this thinking, history is not the sequence of histor­
ical periods but a unique proximity of what is the same, which concerns
thinking in the incalculable ways of destiny and with variable degrees of
immediacy.

Our reflection is now to be aimed at �ietzsche's metaphysic.'i. His think­
ing sees itself under the sign of nihilism. That is the name for a historical
movement, discerned by Nietzsche, which after dominating the preced­
ing centuries has determined the current one. The interpretation of this
movement Nietzsche concentrated into the brief statement: "God is dead."
One might suppose that "God is dead" expresses the belief of Nietzsche
the atheist and hence that it is only a personal opinion and therefore biased,
and thus also easily refuted by pointing out that everywhere today many
people attend churches and endure hardships out of their Christian trust
in God. Yet the question remains whether the word of Niet7.sche which we
quoted is only an extravagant view of a thinker whom it is easy to char­
acterize correctly: he went mad in the end. It must still be asked whether
Nietzsche, if anything, is not rather expressing [ausspricht] here the word
that has always been implicitly [unausgesprochro] spoken within the meta­
physically detennined history of the West. Before reaching any position
too hastily, we must first of all try to think "God is dead" in the way that
it is intended. Hence we will do well to distance ourselves from the rash
opinions that obtrude themselves at once at this terrible statement.
The following considerations are an attempt to comment on Nietzsche's
word in a few essential respects. Let it again be stressed:� Nietzsche's word
gives the destiny of two millennia of Western history.� And we, unprepared
as all of us arc together, we must not think that we will alter this destiny by a
lecture about Niet"t.sche's statement or even learn to know it only adequately.
Nonetheless, this one thing is now necessary: that out of reflection we are
receptive to instruction and that on the way to instruction we learn to reflect.
Not only must any commentary gather the substance from the text, it
must also, imperceptibly and without being too insistent, add something
of its own to it, from its substance. This supplement is what the layman,
regarding what he takes to be the content of the text, always feels as an
interpolation; it is what he, with the right he arrogates to himself, criticizes as
arbitrary. A proper commentary, however, never understands the text better
than its author understood it, though it certainly understands it differently.
Only this difference in understanding must be such that it encounters the
same thing which the explicated text is meditating.
The first time Nietzsche pronounced "God is dead" was in the third
book of La Gnya Scienza, published in 188z. This work was the beginning of
Nietzsche's path toward developing his fundamental metaphysical position.
It is between this work and the fruitless toil that went into shaping his
planned masterwork that Thus Spoke Z'Arathustra was published. The planned
1 60

N IETZSCHE'S WOR D: "GOD I S DEAD"

masterwork was never completed. Provisionally it was to be entitled

The Will

to Power and subtitled "Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values."
As a young man �ietzsche was already familiar with the disturbing

thought of the death of a C'-.o d and the mortality of the gods. In a note
that dates from the time he was drafting his first work
Nietzsche wrote (in

The Birth ofTmgedy,

187o): "I believe in the ancient German saying: all
Faith and Knowledge ( 1 802), the

gods must die." At the end of his treatise

yom1g Hegel identifies the "feeling on which the religion of the modem age
rests - the feeling that God Himself is dead .

. .

"1

Hegel's word thinks some­

thing different from what Nietzsche thinks in his. Nonetheless, between
the two there is an essential connection that conceals itself in the essence
of all metaphysics. Plutarch's remark, cited by Pascal - "Le grand Pan est
mort"

(Pemees, 695)

- belongs, though for contrary reasons, in the same

domain.
Let us, first of all, listen to the complete text of section

1 2 5 of La Gaya

Scienza. The section is entitled "The madman" and rm1s:
'/"he madman.

- Haven't you heard of that madman who lit a lamp in the bright

morning, ran to the market, and cried out ceaselessly: "I'm looking for God� I'm

looking for God!" - As there were a number of people standing about just then who
did not believe in God, he aroused a good deal of laughter. "So did he get lost? ,"
someone said. "Has he lost his way, like a child?," another asked. "Or maybe he's in
hiding?" "Is he afraid of us?" "Gone to sea?" "Emigrated?" - so were they shouting
and laughing riotously. The madman jwnped into the midst of them and his eyes
transfixed them: "\Vhere did God go?," he cried, "I'll tell you where.

We've killed

him - you and I. We are all his murderers. But how have we done this? How were we

able to drink the sea dry? \Vho gave us the sponge to wipe the entire horiwn away?
\Vhat did we do when we unchained this earth from its sun? \Vhere is it moving
to now? \Vhere are we moving to? Away from all the suns? Is there no end to our
plummeting? Backwards, sidewards, forwards, in every direction? Is there still an
up and a down? Aren't we astray as in an endless nothing? It's the empty space, isn't
it, we feel breathing on us? It has become colder, hasn't it? Isn't it always nightfall

and more night? Don't lamps need to be lit in the morning? Do we not yet hear
any of the noise of the grnvediggers who are burying God? Do we not yet smell
anything of the divine putrefaction? - even gods become putrid. God is dead! God
remains dead! And we killed him. How arc we to find consolation, we the murderers
of all murderers? The holiest and mightiest that the world has hitherto possessed
has bled to death under our knives. \Vhat water can cleanse us? \Vhat ceremonies
of expiation, what sacred games, will we have to invent? Isn't the greatness of this
deed too great for us? Don't we have to bccom«; gods ourselves in order merely to
appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed - and whoever will be
horn after us will partake, for this deed's sake, of a history higher than all history in
times past!" - Here the madman fel l silent and looked again at

his audience; they

OFF TI I F. BEATEl': TRACK

too were silent and looked at him and were taken aback. At last he threw his lamp
to the ground, so that it broke into pieces and went out. "I come too early," he said,
then, "the time is not yet mine. The enormous event is still on the way, itinerant it hasn't got as far as the cars of men. Thunder and lighming take time, the light
from stars takes time, deeds take time even after they have been done, to be seen
and heard. This deed is still farther from them than the farthest stars

have tbme it themselves!"

-

t111dyet they

It is told that on the same day the madman forced his way

into different churches and staned to sing his

Requiem aeternnm deo

in them. Led

out and questioned, he would only reply: "What else are these churches, then, if not
the crypts and tombs of God?"

To the four books ofLo Gaya Scienza, Nietzsche appended a fifth in 1 886,
four years later; he gave it the title "We the Fearless." The first section of
this book (aphorism no. 34 3) is headed: "What Cheeifulness Is All About." It
begins: "The greatest modem event - that 'God is dead,' that faith in the
Christian God has become untenable - is already beginning to throw its
first shadows across Europe."
It is clear from this sentence that Nietzsche, in speaking about the death
of God, means the Christian God. But it is no less certain and no less
to he kept in mind beforehand that �ietzsche uses the names "God" and
"Christian God" to indicate the supersensory world in general. God is the
name for the realm of ideas and the ideal. Since Plato, or more accurately,
since the late Greek and the Christian interpretations of the Platonic phi­
losophy, this realm of the supersensory has been considered the true and
a<.:tually real world. In contrast to it, the sensory world is only the un­
real this-worldly world, the changeable and therefore the merely apparent
world. The this-worldly world is the vale of tears in contrast to the moun­
tain of eternal bliss of the other side. If, as is still the case in Kant, we
call the sensory world the physical world in the broadest sense, then the
supersensory world is the metaphysical world.
"God is dead" means: the supersensory world has no effective power.
It does not bestow life. Metaphysics, which for Nietzsche is Western phi­
losophy understood as Platonism, is at an end. Nietzsche understands his
own philosophy as the countermovement against metaphysics, i.e., for him,
against Platonism.
As a mere countermovement, howL'Ver, it necessarily remains trapped,
like everything anti-, in the essence ofwhat it is challenging. Since all it does
is turn metaphysics upside down, Nietzsche's countermovement against
metaphysics remains embroiled in it and has no way out; in fact it is em­
broiled in it to such a degree that it is sealed off from its essence and, as
metaphysics, is unable ever to think its own essence. This is the reason that,

:--J l ETZSCHE'S WOR D : "GOD IS DEAD"

for and through metaphysics, there remains hidden what actuaJiy happens
in and as metaphysics itself.
If God - as the supersensory ground and as the goal of everything that
is real - is dead, if the superscnsory world of ideas is bereft of its binding
and above aJI its inspiring and constructive power, then there is nothing
left which man can rely on and by which he can orient himself. That is
why in the passage we quoted, the question is asked, "Aren't we astray in an
endless nothing?" The statement "God is dead" contains the realization that
this nothing is spreading. Nothing means here: absence of a supersensory,
binding world. Nihilism, "the eeriest of all guests, "1 is standing at the door.
The attempt to comment on �ietzsche's word "God is dead" is synony­
mous with the task of explaining what Nietzsche understands by nihilism
and therefore of describing how Nietzsche stands in relation to nihilism.
However, since this name is so often used only as a tabloid slogan and not
infrequently even as a damning invective, it is necessary to know what it
means. �ot everyone who adverts to the Christian faith or to some meta­
physical conviction thereby stands outside nihilism. Conversely, to ponder
about nothing and its essence does not necessarily make one a nihilist.
That name is popularly used in a tone insinuating that the word "nihilist"
is itself sufficient - without thinking any further with it - to prove that
reflecting on the nothing leads to a descent into the nothing and implies
that a dictatorship of the nothing is to be established.
In general the question is whether the name "nihilism," thought rig­
orously in the sense of Nietz.'>che's philosophy, has only a nihilistic (i.e.,
negative) meaning that pursues its course into void nothing. Since the title
of nihilism has been used vaguely and arbitrarily, it is necessary, before a
more exact discussion of what Nietzsche himself says about nihilism, to win
the proper perspective from which we may ask the very first questions about
nihilism.
Nihilism is a historical movement, not just any view or doctrine held
by just anyone. Nihilism moves history in the way of a scarcely recognized
fundamental process in the destiny of the Western peoples. Hence nihilism
is not just one historical phenomenon among others, not just one spiritual­
intellectual current that occurs within Western history after others have
occurred, after Christianity, after humanism, and after the Enlightenment.
Nihilism, thought in its essence, is on the contrary the fundamental
movement of the history of the West. Its roots arc so deep that its devel­
opment can entail only world catastrophes. Nihilism is the world-historical
movement of the peoples of the earth who have been drawn into modernity's

OFF THE B EATEl\' TRACK

arena of power. That is why it is not only a phenomenon of the present age,
nor even a product originally of the nineteenth century, when admittedly a
keen eye for nihilism awoke and its name became common. Nor is nihilism
a product of particular nations whose thinkers and writers speak specifically
of nihilism. Those who imagine themselves fre of it are perhaps the ones
advancing its development most fundamentally P n of the eeriness of this
eeriest guest is that it cannot name its own origin
Nihilism does not prevail only when the Christian God has been denied,
or when Christianity is embattled, or when a freethinking cheap atheism
is still all that is preached. As long as we look exclusively at this unbelief
which has abandoned Christianity and at its manifestations, our attention
will he fixed externally on the meager fa�ades of nihilism. The speech of
the madman says specifically that the word "God is dead" has nothing in
common with the opinions of those standing about and talking confusedly,
of those who "do not believe in God." 1<> those merely lacking faith in this
way, nihilism as the destiny of their own history has not yet penetrated at
all.
As long as we grasp "God is dead" only as the fommla of unbelief, we
are thinking in terms of theological apologetics and are eschewing what
matters to Nietzsche, namely reflection that thinks about what has already
happened with the truth of the supersensory world and with its relation to
man's essence.
Nor, therefore, does nihilism in Nietzsche's sense in any way coincide
with the state (conceived in a purely negative way) of no longer being able
to believe in the Christian God of the biblical revelation, since by "Chris­
tianity" Nietzsche does not mean the Christian life that existed once for a
short time before the Gospels were set down in writing and before Paul
disseminated his missionary propaganda. For Nietzsche, Christianity is the
historical, secular-political phenomenon of the Church and its claim to
power within the formation of Western humanity and its modem culture.
Christianity in this sense and the Christian life of the New Testament faith
are not the same. Even a non-Christian life can affirm Christianity and make
use ofit for the sake of power; conversely, a Christian life is not necessarily in
need of Christianity. Therefore, a confrontation with Christianity is by no
means an absolute battle against what is Christian, no more than a critique
of theology is a critique of the faith for which theology is supposed to be the
interpretation. For as long as we fai l to pay due attention to these essential
differences, we do not move past the lowlands of the conflicts among world
views.

!': IETZSCJ J E'S WOR D : "GOD I S DEAD"

In "God is dead" the name "God," thought essentially, stands for the
supersensory world of ideals that contain the goal that exists beyond the
earthly life for this life; they determine it thus from above and so in certain
respects from without. But when the pure faith in God as defined by the
Church fades, when theology in particular, the doctrine of the faith, finds
itself curbed and forced to one side in serving its role as the nonnative
explanation of beings in their entirety, then in no way does that fundamental
structure break down in accordance with which the goal set on the scale of
the supersensory has dominated the earthly life of the senses.
The place of C'n>d's vanished authority and the Church's profession of
teaching has been taken by the authority of conscience and, forcibly, by the
authority of reason. The social instinct has risen up against these. Historical
progress has replaced the withdrawal from the world into the supersensory.
The goal of eternal bliss in the hereafter has been transformed into the
earthly happiness of the greatest number. The diligent care that was the
cultus of religion has been replaced by enthusiasm for creating a culture
or for spreading civilization. Creation, once the prerogative of the biblical
God, has become the mark of human activity, whose creative work becomes
in the end business transactions.
Whatever is thus going to be put in the place of the supersensory world
will be variations of the Christian-ecclesiastical and theological interpreta­
tion of the world, an interpretation which adopted its schema of the ordo,
the hierarchical order of beings, from the Hellenistic-Judaic world and
whose fundamental structure was established through Plato at the outset of
We.'itern metaphysics.
The realm for the essence and event of nihilism is metaphysics itself,
always assuming that by "metaphysics" we are not thinking of a doctrine
or only of a specialized discipline of philosophy but of the fundamental
structure of beings in their entirety, so far as this entirety is differentiated
into a sensory and a supersensory world, the former of which is supported
and determined by the latter. Metaphysics is the space of history in which
it becomes destiny for the supersensory world, ideas, God, moral law, the
authority of reason, progress, the happiness of the greatest number, culture,
and civilization to forfeit their constructive power and to become void. We
are calling this essential ruin [ Wesensze7foll] of supersensory its putrefaction
[Vmvesung). Unbelief in the sense of apostasy from the Christian doctrine
of faith is therefore never the essence or the ground of nihilism; rather, it
is always only a consequence of nihilism: for it could be that Christianity
itself represents a consequence and a form of nihilism.

OFF T H E HEATEN TRACK

From this point we now recognize the final misstep, to which we arc still
liable, in grasping and supposedly battling against nihilism. Since we do not
experience nihilism as a historical movement which is already of long dura­
tion and whose essential ground lies in metaphysics itself, we fall victim to
the pernicious desire to take the phenomena, which are in fact only the con­
sequences of nihilism, for nihilism itself, or to represent consequences and
effects as the cause of nihilism. In thoughtlessly accommodating ourselves
to this manner of representation, we have for decades been used to adducing
the dominance of technology or the revolt of the masses as the causes of the
historical condition of our age; we tirelessly analyze the spiritual situation
of the time in these respect'>. Yet every analysis, however knowledgeable
and clever, of man and his position among beings remains thoughtless and
produces only the semblance of reflection, so long as it refrains from think­
ing about a settlement for man's essence and from experiencing that place
in the truth of being.
As long as the mere phenomena of nihilism are taken for nihilism itself,
any opinion about it will remain superficial. And it does not help in the
least when out of discontentment at the condition of the world, or from a
half-avowed despair, or from moralistic outrage, or from devout and self­
righteous superiority, opinions take on a degree of frantic resistance.
In contrast to this, it is above all essential that we reflect. That is why we
will now ask �ietzsche himself what he understands by nihilism; to begin
with, we wiU leave it an open question whether with this understanding
Nietzsche has already caught the essence of nihilism or whether he can
catch it.
In a note from 1 887, Nietzsche poses the question (The Will to Power,
aphorism no. 2): "What docs nihilism mean?" He gives the answer: "That

the highest values devalue the111selves."
This answer is emphasized and a supplementary explanation is provided:
"The goal is missing; the answer to 'why?' is missing."
�ietzsche, accordingly, comprehends nihilism as a historical process. He
interprets this process as the devaluation of the hitheno highest values. God,
the supersensory world as the world that truly is and that determines every­
thing, ideals and ideas, the goals and grounds that determine and suppon
all beings and human life in particular: all these are represented here in the
meaning of the "highest values." According to a view current even now,
what one understands by that tenn is truth, goodness, and beauty: truth,
i.e., that which truly is; goodness, i.e., what everything is everywhere depen­
dent upon; beauty, i.e., the order and unity of beings in their entirety. The
1 66

N I ETZSCH E'S WORD: "(iOD IS DEAlY'

highest values, however, have already devalued themselves now by coming
to understand that the ideal world is not, and not ever, going to be reali1.ed
within the real world. The compulsory nature of the highest values begins
to falter. The question is raised: what is the purpose of these highest values
if they do not also secure the guarantee for, as well as the ways and means
of, realizing the goals they set?
If, however, it were now our intention to understand Nietz.o;chc's defi­
nition of the essence of nihilism according to its wording (that the highest
values arc in the process of becoming valueless), an interpretation of the
essence of nihilism would ensue which has meanwhile become current and
whose <.:urrency is sustained by the label "nihilism": that the devaluing of
the highest values obviously means decadence. Yet in no way for �ietzsche
is nihilism only a phenomenon of decadence; rather, nihilism, as the fun­
damental process of Western history, is also and above all the intrinsic law
of this history. For that reason, even in his observations about nihilism,
�ietzsche cares rather little about describing the course of the process of
devaluation historically and at the end deriving from it the decline of the
West; instead, he thinks nihilism as the "inner logic" of Western history.
In this way Nietzsche recognizes that, even with the devaluation of the
hitherto highest values for the world, the world itself remains; and above all
that the world grown value-less is inevitably impelled toward a new dispen­
sation of value.• After the hitherto highest values have lost their validity, the
new dispensation of value is changed, in regard to the former values, into a
"revaluation of all values." The no to the former values is derived from the
yes to the new dispensation of value. Since (in �ietzsche's view) this yes nei­
ther negotiates nor compromises with the previous values, an absolute no is
part of this yes to the new dispensation of value. In order to secure the abso­
lute character of the new yes against a regression to the former values, i.e.,
in order to ground the new dispensation of value as a countermovement,
Nietzsche calls even the new dispensation of value "nihilism," namely, a
nihilism which, through devaluation, completes itself in a new and exclu­
sively normative dispensation of value. This normative phase of nihilism
Nietzsche calls "fulfilled," i.e., classic nihilism. By nihilism, Nietzsche

un­

derstands the devaluation of the hitherto highest values. Yet at the same
time Nietz.o;che finds himself affirming nihilism in the sense of a "n:valua­
tion of the highest values." The name "nihilism" is therefore ambiguous;
•

OFF TJ-IF. B EATE:"J TRACK

seen in relation to its extremes, it always has two meanings from the start, in
that it designates the pure devaluation of the former highest values, but at
the same time it also means the absolute countermovement to devaluation.
Pessimism, which Nietzsche takes as the early form of nihilism, has the
same double meaning. According to Schopenhauer, pessimism is the belief
that in this the worst of worlds, life is not worth being lived and affirmed.
According to this doctrine life, which means at the same time beings as such
in their entirety, is to be negated. This pessimism, according to Nietzsche,
is the "pessimism of weakness." Everywhere it sees only gloom, finds the
reason that everything will end in failure, and claims to know (in the sense of
universal failure) how everything will come out. In contrast, the pessimism
of strength, and as strength, is in no way deceived, sees the dangers, wants
no glossing over or dissimulation. It sees through to the disastrousness of
merely lying in wait for the hitherto to return. It penetrates into phenomena
analytically and demands awareness of the conditions and powers which, in
spite of everything, secure the mastery of our historical situation.
A more essential reflection would be able to show in what Nietzsche
calls the "pessimism of strength" how the uprising of modern humanity
into the absolute domination of subjectivity within the subjectity of beings
is fulfilled. Through pessimism in its twofold form, the extremes come to
light. Extremes, as such, preserve their preponderance. So a condition is
produced that is an absolute intensification into an either-or. An "intenne­
diate" situation begins to show in which it is clear that, on the one hand, the
former highest values are not being realized. The world appears value-less.
On the other hand, through being made conscious of this fact, attention is
directed to the source of the new dispensation of value, without the world
thereby recovering its value.
It is true that, in face of the faltering domination of the fonner values,
something else can be tried. That is, even if God in the sense of the Christian
God has vanished from his place in the supersensory world, still the place it­
self is preserved, although it has become empty. One can still hold fast to the
evacuated realm of the supersensory and ideal world. The empty place even
invites its own re-occupation and calls for the God who disappeared from
it to be replaced by another. New ideals are being erected.
represents it

(The Will to Powe·r,

As Nietzsche

no. 1 02 1 , from 1 887), this is happening

through the doctrines of world happiness and through socialism, and like­
wise through Wagner's music, i.e., everywhere that "dogmatic Christianity"
"has gone bankrupt." Thus "incomplete nihilism" arises, about which
Nietzsche writes (The

Will to Power, no. 2 8, from 1 887) : "lmomplete nihilism,
r 68

I': I ETZSCI IE'S WO RD: "GOD I S DEAlY'

its forms: we live right in their midst. The attempts to escape nihilism without
revaluing the former values: they produce the opposite, make the problem
more acute."
We can grasp Nietzsche's thoughts about incomplete nihilism more
clearly and acutely by saying: incomplete nihilism indeed replaces the for­
mer values by others, but it always puts them in the old place, which is, as it
were, preserved as the ideal region of the supersensory. Complete nihilism,
however, must eliminate even the place of value itself, the supersensory as
a realm; and it must accordingly alter and revalue values differently.
It is clear, then, that the "revaluation of aU values" is indeed part of the
complete, fulfilled, and consequently classic nihilism, but the revaluation

l

does not merely replace old values by new ones. The revaluing becomes

a reversal of the nature and manner of valuingtfhe dispensation of value
requires a new principle, i.e., something that provides it with a point of
departure and the place to maintain itself. The dispensation ofvalue requires
another realm. :'\"o longer can the principle be the world of the supersensory,
now grown dead. Therefore, nihilism aiming at revaluation (understood in
this way) will seek out what is most alive. So nihilism itself turns into the
"ideal of the most abundant life"

(The Will to Power, no.

1 4, from 1 887). In

this new highest value is concealed another estimation of life, i.e., of the
basis of the determining essence of all living things. So let us now ask what
Nietzsche understands by life.
The allusion to different stages and forms of nihilism demonstrates that
in :'\"ietzsche's interpretation nihilism is always a history dealing with values:
dispensing values, dispensing with values, revaluing values; with dispensing
values anew; and ultimately, actually with the differently valuing establish­
ment of the principle behind every dispensation ofvalues. The highest goals,
the grounds and principles of beings, ideals and the supersensory, God and
the gods - they are all conceived in advance as value. Therefore, we will
not grasp Nietzsche's concept of nihilism adequately until we know what he
understands by value. Only then will we understand "C':r<>d is dead" as it is
thought. A sufficiently clear elucidation of what Niet7.sche thinks with the
word "value" is the key to understanding his metaphysics.
In the nineteenth century, talk of values became frequent, and it became
customary to think in values. llowever, it was only as a consequence of the
broadcasting of�ietzsche's writings that talk of values has become popular.
People speak of life-values, of cultural values, of eternal values, of the hierar­
chy of values, of spiritual values which, for example, are believed to be found
in antiquity. With scholarly activity in philosophy and with the recasting of

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

neo-Kantianism, we arrive at value philosophy. Systems of values are con­
structed; in ethics, values are subdivided. Even in Christian theology God
is defined as the highest value: the

smmn

um

em

qua

summum bonum. The

sciences are taken to be value-free, and value judgments are consigned to
world views. Value and what is valuable are turned into a positivistic substi­
tute for the metaphysical. That talk about value is so frequent accords with
the indetenninacy of the concept. The indeterminat-y, for its part, accords
with the obscurity of the essential origin of value from being. For assuming
that value, so often invoked in these guises, is not nothing, it will have its
essence in being.
\Vhat does �ietzsche understand by value? In what is the essence of value
grounded? Why is �ietzsche's metaphysics the metaphysics of values?

In a note ( 1 887/88) Nietzsche states what he understands by value (The
Will to Powet·, no. 7 1 5): "The viewpoint of 'value' is the viewpoint of the co7l­

ditionsJo1·preservatio11-increase in regard• to the complex structures, relatively
enduring, of life in the midst of becoming."
The essence of value is based on its being a viewpoint. Value means that
which one has in mind

[i11s Auge gefasst].

Value is the point of sight for

[auf
[111it 1111deretll rechnen]

a seeing that has its eye on something, or, as we say, that counts on

etwas rechnet] something and thereby has to deal with

something else. Value stands in an inner relation to a this-much, to quantity
and number. Values are therefore

(The W;t/ to Powe1·, no.

7 r o, from 1 888)

related to a "scale of number and measure." The question still remains: on
what is the scale of increase and diminishment, for its part, grounded?
In characterizing value as a viewpoint, the one essential thing for Niet­
zsche's concept of value foJiows: as a viewpoint, value is always posited by
a seeing and for a seeing. This seeing is of such a kind that it sees in that it
has seen, and that it has seen by re-presenting to itself as a particular thing
that which was sighted, thereby positing it. It is only through this setting
within representation that the point which is necessary for keeping an eye
on something and which therefore directs the visual course of this seeing
becomes a point of sight, that is, becomes what matters in seeing and in all
activity directed by vision. Before this, therefore, values are not something
in themselves, so that they could be taken when necessary as points of sight.
Value is value provided it is valid. It is valid provided it is posited as
what matters. It is so posited by aiming and keeping one's sight on what
must he counted. The point of sight, the regard, the field of view are here
3

�IETZSCHE'S WORD: "GOD IS D EAD"

synonymous with sight

[Gesicht] and seeing [Sehen] in the sense identified by

the Greeks, but which has gone through the transformation of "idea" from

eTSos to perceptio. To sec is to represent; since Leibniz, this representation
has been grasped more explicitly in its fundamental character of striving

(appetit11s).

All beings are representing beings to the extent that

nisus

is

part of the being of beings: 71isus, the urge to make an appearance, the
urge that enjoins a thing to arise
its occurrence

[AufoommenJ

(appear) and so determines

[ Vorkomme11]. The nisus-like essence of all

beings takes and

posits for itself in this way a point of sight. The point of sight provides the
perspective which it is essential to follow. The point of sight is value.
With values as points of view, the "conditionsfor preservation-increase" are
posited, according to Nietzsche. By the very way he writes this - in omitting
the "and" and substituting a hyphen for it - �iet7.sche intends to make it
clear that value.o; as viewpoints are, in their essence and therefore constantly,
simultaneously conditions of preservation

and

increase. When values are

posited, both kinds of conditions must be constantly contemplated in such
a way that they remain in a unified relation to each other. Why? Obviously
simply because the representing-striving beings themselves in their essence
are such that they require these twofold points of sight. For what do values
as viewpoints serve as conditions, if they must be conditions simultaneously
for both preservation and increase?
Preservation and increase mark the fundamental trait-; of life; these traits
intrinsically belong together. The desire to grow, increase, is part of the
essence of life. Tc:> preserve life is to serve the increase of life. Any life that is
restricted to mere preservation is already in decline. For living creatures, it
is never the goal, for example, to secure lebensraum; rather it is the means
to an increase of life. Conversely, life that has been increased intensifies in
its turn the prior need for enlarging one's space. Increase, however, is only
possible where a durable resource has already been preserved as something
made secure and therefore only then capable ofincrease. Hence living things
arc linked by the two fundamental traits of increase and preservation, i.e.,
they are "complex structures of life." Ao; points of view, values guide seeing
in "regard to complex structures." Seeing is always a seeing by the glance of
life, a glance which governs all living things. By setting the points of sight
for living things, life in its essence proves to be that which sets values (cf.

The Will to Power, no. 5 56, from

1 88s/6).

The "complex structures of life" are dependent on the conditions of a
preservation and of a stability [Bestiindigung], yet the dependence is such that
stability

[das BestiindigeJ endures [besteht] only in order to become - through

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

an increase - unstable

(ein U7Jbestii7tdiges]. The duration

of these complex

structures is based on the interrelation of increase and preservation. Hence
it is a comparative duration. The duration of living things, i.e., of life, is
"relatively enduring."
According to Nietzsche, value is "the viewpoint of the conditions for
preservation-increase in regard to the complex structures, relatively endur­
ing, of life in the midst of becoming." Here, and generally in the conceptual
language of Nietzsche's metaphysics, the stark indefinite word "becoming"
does not signify just any flux of all things, nor the mere alteration of states,
and not just any development or vague evolution. Becoming means the
transition from something to something, that movement and being moved
which Leibniz in the
govern the ens qua

M0111d1 ology (§ I I ) calls changements nat11rels, which
ens, i.e., the ens perdpiens et appetms. Nietzsche takes this

governance as the fundamental trait of all reality, i.e., he takes it in the very
broad sense of beings. He understands that which thus determines beings
in their essentia as the "will to power."
When Niet"L.Sche concludes his characterization of the essence of value
with the word "becoming," that final word points to the essential realm
where values and the dispensation of value generally and uniquely belong.
"'Ih become" - that, for Nietzsche, is "the will to power." So the "will to

power" is the fundamental trait of"life," which Nietzsche also often uses in
a broad sense, by which it has been equated within metaphysics (cf. Hegel)
to "becoming." Will to power, becoming, life, and being in the broadest
sense have the same meaning in Nietzsche's language

(The Will to Puwet·,

no. 582, from I 88s/6 and no. 689 from I 888). Inside of becoming, life, i.e.,
the living, takes shape as centers of the will to power that are active at
particular times. These centers are therefore structures of ruling power. It
is as such that Nietzsche understands art, the state, religion, science, society.
That is why he can also say (The

Will to Power, no. 7 I 5) " 'Value' is essentially

the viewpoint for the gain and loss of these centers of ruling power" (namely,
with regard to their ruling character).
So long as Nietzsche, in his delineation of the essence ofvalue cited above,
grasps value as the viewpointed condition of the preservation and increase
of life, but sees life as grounded in becoming and becoming as the will to
power, the will to power reveals itself as that which sets those viewpoints.
The will to power is that which, on the basis of its "inner principle" (Leibniz)
as the

11isus in

the

esse of the ens,

esteems according to values. The will to

power is the ground for the necessity of dispensing values and the origin
of the possibility of value-estimation. Hence Nietzsche says

1 72

(The Will to

N I ETZSCHE'S WOR D : "GOD I S DEAD"

Power, no. 1 4, from 1 887): "Values tmd their altemtio11 stand in relation to the
growth in power ofthe 011e that sets values."
With this it becomes clear: values are the conditions, posited by the will
to power itself, of the will to power itself. It is not until the will to power
comes to light as the fundamental trait of all that is real, i.e., only when
it becomes true and is accordingly conceived as the reality of all that is
real, that we sec where values originate from and by what means all value­
estimation is supported and directed. The principle of dispensing values has
now been discerned. The dispensation ofvalues can be accomplished in the
future "in principle," i.e., on the basis of being as the ground of beings.
This is why the will to power, as this principle that has been discerned
and therefore willed, is at the same time the principle of a new dispensation
of value - new because it is now achieved for the first time knowingly, in
the knowledge of its principle. The dispensation of value is new because
it itself makes its principle secure and at the same time holds fast to this
securement as a value established on the basis ofits principle. As the principle
of the new dispensation of value, however, the will to power is also (in
relation to the former values) the principle of the revaluation of all fonner
values. Yet because the hitherto highest values ruled the sensory from the
height of the supersensory, and because metaphysic.'i is what structured that
rule, to establish the new principle of the revaluation of all values is to
bring about the reversal of all metaphysics. Nietzsche takes this reversal as
the overcoming of metaphysics.3 However, every reversal of this kind will
only be a self-blinding entanglement in what is the same though become
unrecognizable.
However, so long as Nietzsche grasps nihilism as the intrinsic law op­
erating in the history of the devaluation of the hitherto highest values, but
takes devaluation in the sense of the revaluation of all values, nihilism in his
interpretation derives from the rule and breakdown of values and so from
the possibility in general to posit values. This possibility is itself based on
the will to power. This is why Nietzsche's concept of nihilism and his state­
ment "God is dead" can only be adequately understood on the basis of the
essence of the will to power. Let us therefore take the last step in shedding
light on that remark by explaining what Nietzsche is thinking with the title
he coined, "The Will to Power."
The name "The Will to Power" is taken to be so obvious that it is
incomprehensible why someone would still take pains to _explain this word
•

combination in particular. \Vhat "will" means, after all, anyone can know
by experience at any time. 1b will is to strive after something. The meaning
of power, as everyone knows today from daily experience, is the exercise of
mastery and force. Clearly, then, the will "to" power is the striving to come
to power.
The title "The Will to Power," according to this view, presupposes two
different elements that were subsequently put together to form a relation­
ship: willing on one side and power on the other. \Vhen we finally come
to ask about the ground of the will to power, not just to rephrase it hut
also to clarify it, what emerges is the sense that because it is a striving for
something that is not yet a possession, it originates from a feeling of lack.
Striving, the exercise of mastery, and the feeling of lack are states (mental
faculties) and representational modes that we grasp through psychological
knowledge. For this reason, an explanation of the essence of the will to
power belongs to psychology.
\Vhat we have just set forth about the will to power and the possibility
of knowing it is indeed clear, but in every respect such dunking misses what
Nietzsche thinks with the phrase "will to power" and how he thinks it. The
title "Will to Power" provides a fundamental word of Niew;che's ultimate
philosophy, which can therefore be fairly described as the metaphysics of
the will to power. \Vhat the will to power means in �ietzschd; sense, we
will never understand by means of popular ideas about will and power, but
rather only by way of a reflection on metaphysical thinking, and that means
also reflecting on the entirety of the history of Western metaphysics.
The following commentary on the essence of the will to power thinks
in terms of these contexts. Although adhering to �ietzsche's own expla­
nations, it must also put them more clearly than Nietzsche himself could
say directly. Yet what has become clearer to us is only what has already
grown more meaningful to us. Something is meaningful if in its essence
it grows closer to us. \Vhat has preceded and what follows, throughout, is
thought from out of the essence of metaphysics, not only from one of its
phases.
It is in the second part of T!Jtts Spoke Zamthustr11 (written during 1883,
the year after La Gaya Scienza was published) that Nietzsche first places the
"will to power" in the context in which it must be understood: "\Vhere I
found the living, there I found the will to power; and even in the will of the
one who serves I found the will to be master."
'lo will is to will to be master. Will thus understood is found even in the
will of him who serves. Not, it is true, in the sense that a servant might strive
1 74

N I ETZSCHE'S WOR D : "GOD IS D EAD"

to emerge from the role of vassal to become a ma.'i ter himself. Rather, the
vassal as vassal, the servant as servant, always has the will to have something
else under him, over which he has command in the course of his service and
whose service he makes use of. Therefore, as a vassal he is still a master.
Even to be a vassal is to want to be master.
The will is not a desire and not a simple striving for something; rather, will
is in itself command (cf.

The Will to Power, no.

Thus Spoke Zanuhustm, parts I

and ll; in addition,

668, from 1 888). Command has its essence in that

fact that the commanding master is conscious that he has at his disposal the
possibilities of effective action. What is commanded in the command is the
realization of this disposal.

In the command, the one giving the command

(and not just the one carrying it out) is obedient to this disposal and to the
condition of having at his disposal: this is how he obeys himself. In this way,
by continuing to risk himself, the one giving the command is superior to
himself. lo command, which is to be carefully distinguished from merely
ordering others about, is to overcome oneself and is more difficult than
obeying. Will is gathering oneself together for the task at hand. Only he who
cannot obey himself must continue to be specifically subject to command.
Will strives for what it wills not just as for something that it does not yet
have. Will already has what it wills. For will wills its willing. Its will is
what it has willed. Will wills itself. It exceeds itself. In this way will as will
wills above and beyond itself, and therefore at the same time it must bring
itself beneath and behind itself. This is why Nietzsche can say

(The Will to

Power, no. 675, from I 887/8): "'lo U'ill at all amounts to the will to become
m·onger, the will to grow . . . " I Iere "stronger" indicates "more power," and
that means: only power. For the essence of power is to be master over the
level of power attained at a particular time. Power is power only when and
only for as long as it is an increase in power and commands for itself "more
power." To halt the increase of power only for a moment, merely to stand
still at one level of power, is already the beginning of a decline in power. Part
of the essence of power is the overpowering of it'ielf. This overpowering
belongs to and springs from power itself, since power is command and as
command it empowers itself to overpower the level of power it has at any
time. So power is indeed constantly on the way to power it'ielf, but not as
a will available for itself somewhere, not as a will which is trying (in the
sense of striving) to come to power. Nor docs power empower itself to
overpower its level of power merely for the !;ake of the next level, but rather
for this one reason alone: in order to seize hold

[bemiichtigen] of itself in the

absolute character of its essence. To will, according to this definition of its

1 75

OFF Ti l E B EATEI': TRACK

essence, is much less a striving than striving is the residual or incipient fonn
of will.
In the expression "Will to Power" the word "power" gives the essence
of the mode in which will wills itself to the extent that it is command. As
command, will joins itself to itself, i.e., to what it has willed. This self­
gathering is the empowering of power. Will exists for itself no more than
power for itself. Will and power, therefore, are not subsequently linked by
the will to power; rather, will, as the will to will, exists as the will to power
in the sense of the empowerment of power. Power, however, has its essence
in the fact that it stands in relation to will as the will that is inside the will.
The will to power is the essence of power. It indicates the absolute essence
of will which wills itself as sheer will.
l lence the will to power cannot be dropped in favor ofa will to something
else, e.g., the "will to nothing"; for this will too is still the will to will - that
is what enables Nietzsche to say (On the Genealogy ofMomls, Third Treatise,
§ 1 , from 1 887): "it [the will] will will nothing rather than not will."
To "will nothing" in no way means to will the sheer absence of all reality,
but rather precisely to will reality but to will it as a nullity everywhere and at
every time and only in this way to will annihilation. In such willing, power
is still securing for itself the possibility of command and the ability to be
master.
As the essence of will, the essence of the will to power is the fundamental
trait of all reality. Nietzsche writes (The Will to Power, no. 693, from 1 888):
The will to power is "the inmost essence of being." Here "being" is used
in accordance with the language of metaphysics: beings in general. As the
fundamental character of beings, therefore, the essence of the will to power
and the will to power itself are not to be ascertained through psychologi­
cal observation; rather, it is the other way round: psychology itself gets its
essence, i.e., the ability to set and to recognize its object, only through the
will to power. Hence Nietzsche does not understand the will to power psy­
chologically, but rather the opposite: he gives psychology a new definition
as the "morphology and doctrine ofthe de-oelopment ofthe will to pown·" (Beyond
Good and Rvil, § 2 3). Morphology is the ontology of the ov, whose llOP�li
(which too was changed when eTSos was changed into perceptio) appears as
the will to power in the appetitus of the perceptio. Since antiquity, metaphysics
has thought beings as VrrOKEIIlevov, mbiecttmt, in regard to being; that meta­
physics has turned into psychology as defined by Nietzsche attests (though
only as a derivative phenomenon) to the essential event which consists in a
change of the beingness of beings. The ovaia (beingness) of the mbiectu111

:'I: IETZSCJ I E'S WO RD: "GOD I S D EAD"

becomes the subjectity of self-consciousness,.' which now brings its essence
to light as the will to will. As the will to power, will is the command to
more-power. In order for will, in the overpowering of itself, to be able to
overcome the level it has reached at a given time, this level must already
have been attained, set."Ul"cd, and retained. 'Ia secure a given level of power
is the condition necessary for intensifying power. However, this necessary
condition is not sufficient to ensure that the will is able to will itself, i.e.,
that a will to be stronger is, that an increase of power is. Will must look
into the field of sight, must first open this field, in order that the possibili­
ties from there (possibilities that indicate the way for an increase in power)
show themselves in the first place. Will must set such a condition of willing­
above-and-beyond-itself. Above all, the will to power must set: conditions
for the preservation and increase of power. Part of willing is the setting of
these conditions which belong together intrinsically.
Will, in general, amounts to the will to becomc stronge1·, the will to grow ­
and also to will "the mea11s to that end'' (Tbe Will to Puwer, no. 67 5, from
! 887/88).
The essential means are the conditions of the will to power itself that
arc posited by the will to power itself. Nietzsche calls these conditions
"values." He writes (WL'1"ke, vol. XIII, "Nachgelassene Werke," § 395, from
1 885): "In all will is an esteeming estimation." To e.'iteem means: to constitute
and ascertain value. The will to power esteems in that i t constitutes the
condition of increase and fixes the condition of preservation. In accordance
with its essence, the will to power is the will that posits values. Values are
the conditions of preservation-increase within the being of beings. The will
to power, as soon as it comes to light specifically in its pure essence, is itself
the ground and realm for the dispensation of value. The will to power has
its ground not in a feeling of lack; rather, it is itself the ground of the most
abundant [iiberreichstm} life. Life means here the will to will. " 'Living': that
already means 'to esteem'" (loc. cit.).
Since will is the overpowering of itself, no richness [Reicht7lm} of life
will satisfy it. It has its power in overreaching [im Uberreichen} - namely, in
reaching over its own will. Thus it, as the same, is constantly coming back
unto itself as the Same. The mode i n which beings (whose essentio is the
will to power) in their entirety exist, their existentia, is the "eternal return of
the same." The two fundamental terms of Nietzsche's metaphysics, "will to
power" and "eternal return of the same," determine beings in their being
in accordance with the perspectives which have guided metaphysics since
antiquity, the ens qtto ens in the sense of essentia and existentia.
1 77

OFF THE BEATE!': TRACK

The essential relation between the "will to power" and the "eternal return
of the same" must be thought in this way; however, we cannot yet represent i t
here directly because metaphysics has neither considered nor even inquired
about the origin of the distinction between

essentia and existentia.

If metaphysics thinks beings in their being as the will to power, then it
necessarily thinks them as setting values. It thinks everything in the horizon
of values, the validity of values, devaluation, and revaluation. The meta­
physics of modernity begins with and has its essence in the fact that modem
metaphysics seeks the absolutely undoubtable, what is certain, certainty.

as a result he (thinking truth as certainty) discovers the

ject becomes self-consciousness. The subjectity of the subject is determined
out of the certainty of this consciousness.
By positing its own preservation, i.e., the securing of its own continued
existence, as a necessary value, the will to power simultaneously justifies the
necessity of such securing in all beings which, represen ting in an essential
way, therefore also hold things to be true. Securing by holding to be true
is called certainty.

In Nietzsche's judgment, it is only in the will to power

that certainty is truly grounded as the principle of modem metaphysics,
assuming of course that truth is a necessary value and that certainty is the
modem form of truth. This makes clear the extent to which, in Niet1.sche's
doctrine of the will to power as the "essence" of all reality, the modem
metaphysics of subjectity is completed.
This is the reason Nietzsche writes: "The question of value is morefimda­
mmtal than the question of certainty: the latter becomes serious only under
the assumption that the question of value has already been settled" (Tbe
Will to Powe1·, no. 588, from t 887/88).
However, once the will to power has been recognized as the principle
of the dispensation of value, inquiry into value must at once reflect on
the identity of the highest value tha t necessarily follows from this prin­
ciple and accords with it. In that the essence of value manifests itsel f
as the condition of preservation-increase posited in the will to power, a

N I ETZSCHE'S WOR D: "GOD IS D F.A D "

perspective has been opened for characterizing the normative structure of
value.
To preserve the levels of power which the will has attained at particular
times requires that the will surround itself with that which it can reliably
and at any time fall hack on and from which its security is to be guaranteed.
These surroundings enclose the enduring existence

name "beings." Often he gives them the name "being," again true to the
manner of speaking used by metaphysical thinking. Since the beginning of
Western thinking, beings have been considered as the true and as truth,
while in the meantime the sense of "beings" and "true" have transfonned
themselves in many ways. When Nietzsche gives just the simple name "be­
ing" or "beings" or "truth" to what is fixed i n the will to power for the
preservation of that will, he remains in the unbroken line of the traditions
of metaphysics, despite all its reversals and revaluations. Accordingly, truth
is a condition set in the essence of the will to power, namely, the condition
of the preservation of power. Truth, as this condition, is a value. However,
because the will can will only on the basis of having something enduring at
its disposal, truth is the value necessary for the will to power and originating
from the essence of the will to power. The name of "truth" signifies now
neither the unconcealment of beings nor the agreement of knowledge and
object of knowledge, nor certainty as the delivering and securing [Zu-

and which secures the surroundings out of

which the will to power itself wills.
For securing the level of power attained at a given time, truth is the
necessary value. But it is not enough to att'"J in a level of power; for what is
enduring, taken in itself, is powerless to give what the will needs before all
else in order to go above and beyond itself, i.e., what it must have in order

1 79

OFF THE BEATEI'\ TRACK

to go into the possibilities of command. These possibilities are given only
by a penetrating preview that is of the essence of the will to power; for as
the will to more-power, the will to power is in itself perspectival toward
possibilities. Making such possibilities open and available constitutes the
condition, characterized as follows, for the essence of the will to power: that
as the condition which is antecedent in the literal sense of going before, it
exceeds the condition originally mentioned. That is why Nietzsche writes
(The Will to Power, no. 85 3, from 1 887/88): "But truth is not to be taken as
the highest value, and even less as the highest power."
The creation of the possibilities for the will, possibilities which enable
the will to power to free itself for itself in the first place, is for Niet".lSche the
essence of art. In accordance with the metaphysical concept of art, Nietzsche
does not, under the rubric "art," think exclusively or even primarily of
the aesthetic realm of artists. Art is the essence of the willing that opens
perspectives and takes possession of them. "The artwork, where it appears
withom an artist, e.g., as body, as organization (Prussian officer corps, jesuit
order). To what extent the artist is only a preliminary stage. The world as
an artwork that gives birth to itself" (The Will to Power, no. 8 5 1 , from 1 888).
The essence of art, grasped on the basis of the will to power, is the fact
that art excites the will to power toward the will in the first place and spurs
it to willing above and beyond itself. Because �ietzsche, in a faded echo
of the �wf} and cpvats of the early Greek thinkers, often refers to the "will
to power" (understood as the reality of what is real) as "life," he is able to
say that art is "the great stimulant of life" (The Will to Powet·, no. 85 1 , from
1 888).
Art is the condition, set in the essence of the will to power, that enables the
will, as the will that it is, to climb to power and to heighten power. Because it
sets such a condition, art is a value. As that condition which takes precedence
in the hierarchy of the conditions for securing durables and which therefore
precedes all conditions, art is the value which first opens all the heights to
be climbed. Art is the highest value. In comparison with the value of truth, it
is the higher value. One summons the other, each in its different way. Both
values determine in their value-relationship the unitary essence of this will
to power that intrinsically sets values. This will is the reality of what is real,
or, taking the word further than Nietzsche usually cares to employ it: it is
the being of beings. If metaphysics is obliged to speak beings in respect to
being and thereby and in accordance with its nature to specify the ground
of beings, then the ground-thesis of the metaphysics of the will to power
must state that ground. The thesis declares which values arc set essentially
1 80

:"J I ETZSCI-J F.'S WORD: "GOD IS DEAD"

and in which hierarchy of values they are posited within the essence

[ Wesen]

of the value-setting will to power as the "essentia

[&enz]" of beings. The
thesis runs: "Art is worth 111ore than truth" (The WiD to Po7J.!e1", no. 853, from
x 887/88).
The ground-thesis of the metaphysics of the will to power is a thesis of
value.
From the highest thesis of value it becomes clear that the setting of
value as such is essentially twofold. In the dispensation of value there is
set, whether explicitly or not, one necessary and one sufficient value; both,
however, are set on the basis of the prevailing relationship of the two toward
each other. This doubleness of the dispensation of value corresponds to its
principle. The will to power is where the dispensation of value as such is
sustained and directed from. Out of the unity of its essence, it both desires

[verlangt]

and suffices for

[/angt]

the conditions for its own increase and

preservation. A look at the twofold essence of the dispensation of value
brings thinking expressly before the question about the essential unity of
the will to power. Since the will to power is the "essentia" of beings as such,
and since saying this is the metaphysically true, we will be asking about the
truth of the true whenever we think about the essential unity of the will to
power. With this question we arrive

[gela11gen]

at the highest point of this

and every metaphysics. Yet what do we mean here by the highest point? Let
us explain what is meant in connection with the essence of the will to power
in order to remain within the bounds set for the current examination.
The essential unity of the will to power can be nothing but this will
itself. Its unity is the mode by which the will to power as will brings itself
before itself. The unity places the will itself into the will's own examination.
Moreover, it places the will before itself in such a way that it is not until
the will is subject to this examination that it purely represents itself and
therefore represents [rej11·iisentiert] itself in its highest form. Here, however,
representation

[Rep1·asmtation]

is in no way a supplement to presentation

[Darstelltmg]; rather, the presence [Priismz]

that is detemtined on the basis

of representation is the mode in which and as which the will to power

is.

Yet this mode, in which the will to power is, is at the same time the
manner in which it places it'ielf into the unconcealment of itself. Its truth
lies in this unconcealment. The question about the essential unity of the
will to power is the question about the nature of this truth in which the will
is as the being of beings. At the same time; however, this truth is the truth
of beings as such; metaphysics is as this truth. Accordingly, the truth now
in question is not the truth which the will to power sets as the necessary

OFF Ti l E B EATEJ\: TRACK

condition of beings as particular beings, but rather the truth in which the
condition-setting will to power essences as such a will. This oneness in
which it essences, its essential unity, concerns the will to power itself.
Of what nature is this truth of the being of beings? It can be deter­
mined only from that of which it is the truth. But within modem meta­
physics the being of beings has been detennined as will and thereby as
self-willing; however, self-willing is intrinsically already self-knowing-itself;
therefore, beings, the \11TOKEi1.1evov, the subiect11111, are essentially in the mode
of self-knowing-itself. Beings (mbiectum) present [priisentiert] themselves,
in fact they present themselves to themselves, in the mode of the ego cog­
ito. This self-presenting, the re-presenting [Re-priisentation] (representation
[Hn"-stelltmg]), is the being of beings qua subiectum. Self-knowing-itself be­
comes the quintessential subject. In self-knowing-itself all knowledge and
all that knowledge can know is gathered. It is a gathering of knowledge, like
the mountain range I Gebirge] is a gathering of mountains [Berge]. The sub­
jectivity of the subject, as a gathering of this sort, is the co-agitatio (cogitatio),
the conscientia, Ge-wissen, consdroce.s The co-agitatio, however, is intrinsically
already velle, to will. With the subjectity of the subject, will comes to light
as the essence of that subjectity. Modem metaphysics, as the metaphysics
of subjectivity, thinks the being of beings in the sense of will.
As the primary determination of its essence, subjectity requires that the
representing subject assures itself of itself, which means that it also con­
stantly assures itself of what it has represented as a particular something.
In keeping with that assurance, the truth of beings as certainty [ Gewissheit]
has the character of security [Sicher·heit] (certitudo). Self-knowing-itself (the
place of certainty as such) is for its part a variant of the former essence of
truth, namely the correctness (1·ectitudo) of representation. However, what
is correct now no longer consists of an adequation to what presences un­
thought in its presence. Correctness now consists in adjusting all that is to
be represented to the standard that is set in the knowledge-claim of the res
cogita11s sive mens. This claim appeals to the security that consists in the fact
that representation and everything to be represented are driven together
and gathered into the clarity and distinctness of the mathematical idea. The
ens is the e11s co-agitattml perceptionis. Representation, now, is correct if it does
justice to this claim to security. Demonstrated as correct [richtig] in this way,
representation, as made right [recht gefortigt] and at our disposal, is justified
[gerecbt-fer'tigt] . A'i security (certitudo), the truth of beings in the sense of the
self-certainty of subjectity is fundamentally the justification [Recht-fmigen)
of representation and what it represents before the brightness proper to

therefore justice [Gerechtigkeit] itself. By being always a subject, the subject

makes itself certain ofits securing. lt justifies itself before the claim to justice
that it has itself set.
At the beginning of modernity, the question dawned anew how man
amidst the entirety of beings, which means before the beingmost ground of
all beings (God), can become and be certain of his own continuing duration,
i.e., of his own salvation. This question of the certainty of salvation is the
question of justification, i.e., of justice

(iustitia).

Within modern metaphysics, it is Leibniz who first thinks the subiectmn
as the enspe1·cipiens et appete11s. It is Leibniz, thinking on the vis which charac­
terizes the ens, who for the first time clearly thinks the willing essence of the
being of beings. In his twenty-four theses about metaphysics, Leibniz writes

20): iustitia nihil aliud est quam ordo setl peifectio circa mentes. The
mentes, i.e., the res cogitantes, are (I'hc.o;is 2 2) the primariae Mundi tmitates.6

[Rech�ge] of the justification [Recht­

of and by the representing subject, which has fixed for itself its

essence in the self-rightedness of its "I think."
In the essence of truth as certainty (certainty thought as the truth of sub­
jectity and subjectity as the being of beings), justice is hidden, experienced
on the basis of the justification by security. Although this justice prevails as
the essence of the truth of subjectity, it is not, however, thought within the
metaphysics of subjectity as the truth of beings. And yet justice must come
into the thinking of modern metaphysics as the being of beings that knows
itself, just as soon as the being of beings appears as the will to power. The
will to power knows itself as that which essentially sets values, that which se­
cures itself in the positing of values, and that which thereby constantly does
justice to itself and in such doing is justice. It is in and as this justice that the
proper essence of the will to power must represent, which means, thought
in the tem1s of modem metaphysics: must be. In Nietzsche's metaphysics,
the thought of value is more fundamental than the fundamental tl10ught
of certainty in Descartes' metaphysics, since certainty can only count as
right if it also counts as the highest value. Similarly, in the age that has

OFF T H E BEATEJ'\ TRACK

witnessed the completion of Western metaphysics in Nietzsche, the lucid
self-certainty of subjectity has proved to be the justification by the will to
power in accordance with the justice that prevails in the being of beings.
Nietzsche, in an early and more widely known piece (the second un­
timely observation, "On the Use and Disadvantage of I Jistory for Life"),
already replaced the objectivity of historical knowledge with "justice" (sec­
tion 6). But otherwise he was silent on the topic. Not until the decisive
years r 884-85, when the "will to power" stood before his thoughtful eye
as the fundamental trait of beings, did he write down two thoughts about
"justice," without publishing them.
The first note ( 1 884) is entitled "The Ways of Freedom." It runs: "Justice
as the manner of thinking which builds, eliminates, annihilates out of
value-estimation; the highest 1·epresentative of lifo itself " (Werke, vol. XIII,
"Nachgelassene Werke," § 98).
The second note (I 88s) states: "Justice, as the function of a power that
sees far and wide, that sees past the narrow perspectives of good and evil,
therefore has a wider horizon of interest: the intention to preserve something
that is more than this or that person" (Werke, vol. XIII , "Nachgelassenc
Werke," § 1 58).
A meticulous explication of these thoughts would exceed the bounds of
the reflection attempted here. Here let it suffice to point to the essential
area where justice, as thought by Nietzsche, belongs. 'Io prepare to un­
derstand the justice that Nietzsche has in mind, we must exclude all the
ideas about justice that come from Christian, humanist, Enlightenment,
bourgeois, and socialist morality. For Nietzsche does not at all understand
morality as something determined in the first place within the ethical and
juridical realms. Rather, he thinks morality on the basis of the being of be­
ings in their entirety, i.e., on the basis of the will to power. What is just [das
Gerechte] is in accordance with what is right [dem Rechtm]. However, what
is right is determined on the basis of that which is in being as a being. That
is why Nietzsche says (Werke, vol. XIII, "Nachgelassene Werke," § 46 2 ,
from I 883): "Right = the will to make a momentary power relation ob­
tain eternally. To be satisfied with that power relation is the pre-condition.
Everything venerable is called in to let what is right appear to be eternal."
Parallel to this is a note from the following year: "The problem ofjustice.
The first and most powerful thing is precisely the will and strength to
overpower. The ruler establishes "justice" only afterward, which means, he
measures things in accordance with his own measure. If he is very powerful,
he can go very far in recognizing and letting alone the individual who is

1'\JETZSCHF.'S WOR D: "GOD IS DEAD"

trying (Werke,

vol. XIII, "Nachgelassene Werke," § 1 8 1 ). Although it may

well be expected that Nietzsche's metaphysical concept of justice will still
disconcert conventional ideas, he nonetheless hits on the essence of the
justice which was already historically true at the beginning of the completion
of the modem age, in the struggle for mastery over the earth, and which
therefore determines all human transactions in this age, explicitly or not,
hiddenly or openly.
Justice thought by Niet7.sche is the truth of the beings that are in the
mode of the wi ll to power. I lowever, even Nietzsche failed to think justice
explicitly as the essence of the truth of beings; nor, out of such thought,
did he bring up the metaphysics of completed subjectity. Justice, however,
is the truth of beings that is detennined by being itself. A5 this truth, jus­
tice is metaphysics itself in its modem completion. In metaphysics itself
is hidden the reason why Nietzsche is indeed able to experience nihilism
metaphysically but nonetheless is not able to think the essence of nihilism.
We do not know what hidden fom1, enjoined out of the essence of jus­
tice as the truth of justice, has been obtaining for the metaphysics of the
will to power. The first ground-thesis of this metaphysics has scarcely been
expressed and not even in the form of a thesis. Certainly, within this meta­
physics the thesis-character of this thesis is

sui groeris.

Certainly, the first

thesis of value is not the major premise in a deductive system of theses. Even
if we understand the rubric "ground-thesis of metaphysics" in the conser­
vative sense that it identifies the essential ground of beings as such, i.e., it
identifies them in the unity of their essence, it is still sufficiently broad and
complex to determine, in accordance with the nature of a given metaphysics,
the mode in which that metaphysics speaks of this ground.
Niet7.sche expressed the first value-thesis of the metaphysics of the will
to power in yet another form
possess art so that we do

(The Will to Power, no. 822, from 1 888): "We

not perish ofthe truth."

This thesis about the metaphysical relation in essence (which means
here the metaphysical relation in value) between art and truth is admittedly
not something to be grasped according to our ordinary ideas about truth
and art. If this happens, everything becomes banal and we lose - and this is
now very dire - the possibility of seeking an essential confrontation with the
hidden position of modem metaphysics that is bringing itself to completion,
a confrontation that would free us from the obfuscation of histories and
world views.

In the formula just given for the ground-thesis of the metaphysics of the

will to power, art and truth are thought as the fundamental structures of

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

mastery for the will to power in relation to man. How the essential relation of
the truth of beings as such to the man's essence is in fact to be thought within
metaphysics and in accordance with the essence of metaphysics still remains
hidden from our thinking. The question is hardly asked, and because of the
predominance of philosophical anthropology, it is utterly confused.

In any

case, however, it would be a mistake should someone take this formula of a
value-thesis as evidence that Nietzsche philosophized "existentially." That
he never did. But he did think metaphysically. We are not yet ready for the
rigor of a thought like the following, which Nietzsche wrote around the
time he was thinking about the masterpiece he had planned,

The Will to

Puwer:
Around the hero, everything becomes a tragedy; around the demi-god, everything
turns into a satyr play; and around God, everything becomes - what? maybe the
"world" -

(Beyond Good nnd Evil, § I 50 [ I 886])
Though it is bound to show a different face if taken from the point of
view of histories and rubrics, Nietzsche's thinking, as we must now learn to
realize, is no less rigorously substantial than the thinking of Aristotle, who in
the fourth book of the Metaphysics thinks the principle of contradiction as the
first truth about the being of beings. It has become the customary practice
(though not less problematic for being customary) to juxtapose Nietzsche
and Kierkegaard, but this juxtaposition fails to recognize the essence of
Nietzsche's thinking; it therefore fails to see that Nietzsche as a metaphysical
thinker preserve.'i a proximity to Aristotle. Although he cites Aristotle more
often, Kierkegaard is essentially distant from him. For Kierkegaard is not a
thinker but a religious writer, and not just one religious writer among others
but the only one who accords with the destiny of his age. His greatness lies
in this fact - unless talking in this way is already a misunderstanding.

In the ground-thesis of �ietLSche's metaphysics, the essential unity of

the will to power is identified along with the essential relation of the values
art and truth. It is from this essential unity of beings as such that the meta­
physical essence of value is determined. Value is the twofold condition of
the will to power itself, a condition set in the will to power for the will to
power.
Because ;..;ietLsche experiences the being of beings as the will to power,
his thinking must think outward to values. That is why it is essential to pose
the question of value everywhere and before anything else. This question
is experienced as a historical question.

� I ETZSCHE'S WORD: "GOD I S DEAD"

What is happerung with the hitherto highest values? What is the signif­
icance of the devaluation of these values in regard to the revaluation of all
values? Because thinking in tenns of values is grounded in the metaphysics
of the will to power, Niet7.sche's interpretation of nihilism, as the process
of devaluing the highest values and revaluing all values, is a metaphysical
interpretation; it is metaphysical, in fact, in the sense of the metaphysics of
the will to power. However, in that Nietzsche grasps his own thinking (the
doctrine of the will to power as the "principle of the new dispensation of
value") in the sense of the actual completion of ruhilism, he no longer un­
derstands nihilism only negatively as the devaluation of the highest values,
but rather also positively, as the overcoming of nihilism; for the reality of
what is real as that reality is now explicitly experienced, the will to power,
has become the origin and measure of a new dispensation of values. The
values of this dispensation of values directly detennine human represen­
tation and likewise fuel human transactions. Being human is raised into a
different dimension of oceurring.
In the excerpt we read, § 1 2 5 from La Gaya &ienza, the madman has this
to say about the action by men through which God was killed, i.e., through
whieh the supersensory world was devalued: "There has never been a greater
deed - and any who will be born after us will partake, for this deed's sake,
of a history higher than all history in time past!"
With the consciousness that "God is dead" a consciousness begins to
fonn of a radical revaluation of the hitherto highest values. After such con­
sciousness, man himself moves into another history that is higher because
in it the principle of all dispensation of value, the will to power, is specifi­
cally experienced and undertaken as the reality of what is real, as the being
of beings. Self-consciousness, in which modem humanity has its essence,
thereby takes the final step. It wills itself as the enforcer of the absolute
will to power. The decline of nonnative values is at an end. Nihilism "that the highest values devalue themselves" - is overcome. The humanity
that wills its own being-human as the will to power and finds this being­
human to be at home in the reality determined in its entirety by the will to
power is determined by a fonn of human essence that goes beyond erstwhile
man.
The name for this fonn of humanity's essence that goes beyond the
previous race is "the overman." By that tenn Niet7.sche does not understand
some isolated human specimen in whom th� capacities and intentions of the
men we see every day have been gigantically magnified and intensified. Nor
is "the overman" the sort of man who only comes into being by way of

OFF TilE BEATEN TRACK

applying Nietzsche's philosophy to life. The name "ovennan" refers to the
essence of the humanity that, as modern humanity, begins to enter into the
completion of the essence of itc; age. "The overman" is the man which man

is on

the basis of the reality determined by the will to power and for this

reality.
The man whose essence is the essence that is willing and willed out of
the will to power is the overman. The willing of the essence that is willing
and willed in this way must correspond to the will to power as the being of
beings. Along with the thinking that thinks the will to power, therefore, the
question necessarily arises: in what shape must the human essence, willed
and willing out of the being of beings, place itself and develop so that it
will satisfy the will to power and thus be able to undertake mastery over
beings? Unexpectedly

[u11versehens]

and above all unprepared

[unversehrn],

man finds himself placed, on the basis of the being of beings, before the task
of undertaking mastery of the earth. Did erstwhile man sufficiently consider
in what mode the being of beings appears in the meantime? Did erstwhile
man make certain of whether his essence has the maturity and strength to
redeem the claim of this being? Or has erstwhile man been helped along only
with makeshifts and by detours that have continually driven him away from
experiencing that which is? Erstwhile man would like to remain erstwhile
man; at the same time, he is already the being that is willed and willing
among beings, the being of which beings is beginning to appear as the will
to power. Erstwhile man in his essence is not yet prepared at all for the being
that meanwhile prevails over beings. In it prevails the necessity that man
go beyond erstwhile man, not from mere desire and not merely arbitrarily,
but solely for being's sake.
�ietzsche's thought that thinks the overman originates from a thinking
that thinks being ontologically as beings and so submits to the essence of
metaphysics without, however, being able to experience this essence within
metaphysics. That is why, for Nietzsche just as in all metaphysics before
him, it remains hidden in what way the essence of man is determined on
the basis of the essence of being. That is why, in Nietzsche's metaphysics,
the ground of the essential connection between the will to power and the
overman is necessarily obscured. Yet in every obscuration an appearing is
already prevailing at the same time. The existrntin that is part of the

essrntin

of beings, i.e., of the will to power, is the eternal return of the same. Being,
thought in that return, contains the relation to the essence of the overman.
However, this relation necessarily remains unthought in its essence that is
related to being

[seinsmiifligen] .

That is why, even for NietLSche himself,

1 88

:'ll i ETZSCHF.'S WOR D : "GOD I S D EAD"

the connection is obscure between the thinking that thinks the overman
in the shape of Zarathustra and the essence of metaphysics. That is why
the character of the work Thus !:>poke 7.arnthustra as a work remains hidden.
Only when future thinking has been brought into a position to think this

(I 7 1 4) of Leibniz; and only when this future thinking has been brought to
think them not only metaphysically, but also on the basis of the essence of
metaphysics; only then arc the right and duty to confront this work, as well
as the ground and horizon for a confrontation, established.
It is easy but irresponsible to be outraged by the idea and the figure
of the overman, which was designed to be misunderstood; it is easy but
irresponsible to pretend that one's outrage is a refutation. It is difficult
but for future thinking unavoidable to attain the high responsibility out of
which Nietzsche reflected on the essence of that humanity destined (in the
destiny of being as the will to power) to undertake mastery over the earth.
The essence of the overman is not a warrant for a fit of capricious frenzy.
It is the law, grounded in being itself, of a long chain of the highest self­
overcomings, which alone will make man ripe for beings which as beings
are part of being. This being as the will to power brings to light its essence
as the will to power and through this disclosure is epoch making, that is, it
makes the last epoch of metaphysics.
According to Nietzsche's metaphysics, erstwhile man is called erstwhile
because although his essence is determined by the will to power as the
fundamental trait of all beings, he nonetheless has not experienced and
taken over the will to power as this fundamental trait. The man moving
beyond erstwhile man receives the will to power (as the fundamental trait
of all beings) into his own willing and thus wills himself in the sense of the
will to power. All beings are as beings set in this will. What, in the mode of
goal and norm, used to condition and determine man's essence has forfeited
its unconditional and immediate - and above all its ubiquitously infallibly
effective [wirksame] - power to effect [Wirku7lg:mtncht]. No longer does that
supersensory world of goals and norms inspire and sustain life. That world
has itself grown lifeless: dead. The Christian faith will still exist here and
there. However, the love that prevails in such a world is not the effecting­
effective [wi1·kend-wirksame] principle of that which is taking place now.
Thought as the effective reality [wirksame Wit·klichkeit) of everything real

unreal

[unwirklich] .

This is the metaphysical sense of the metaphysically

thought word "God is dead."
Are we going to continue to close our eyes before the truth of this word
that is to be thought in this way? Even if this is oUT intention, Nietzsche's
word will not lose its truth through this unaccountable blindness. God
ceases to be a living God if in our continuing attempts to master the real
we fail to take his reality seriously beforehand and question it, if we fail to
reflect whether man has so matured toward the essence into which he is
forced from out of being that he withstands this destiny that sends him out
of his essence, and does so without the false relief of mere expedients.
The attempt to experience the truth of that statement of God's death
without illusions is something different from a confession of faith in Niet­
zsche's philosophy. Had that been OUT intention, then thinking would not
be served by such assent. We attend to a thinker only by thinking. This
requires that we think everything essential that is thought in his thought.
If God and the gods are dead in the sense of the metaphysical experience
described above, and ifthe will to power is consciously willed as the principle
behind every setting of conditions on beings, i.e., as the principle of the
dispensation of value, then mastery over beings as such in the shape of
mastery over the earth passes over to the new human willing, detennined
by the will to power. Nietzsche closes the first part of Thus Spoke Zarath ustra

It is possible, thinking crudely, to believe that Nietzsche's word says that
mastery over beings passes from God to man, or, even more crudely, that
Nietzsche sets man in the place of God. Those who take it in that way,
however, are not thinking very divinely about the essence of the divinity.
Man can never be set in God's place because the essence of man never
attains the essential realm of God. On the contrary, compared with that
impossibility, something far eerier happens, the essence of which we have
scarcely begun to reflect upon. The place which, metaphysically thought,
is proper to God is the region of causal effectivity and the preservation of
beings as created beings. This region for God can remain empty. In its place,
another (i.e., a place that corresponds to it metaphysically) can open up that
is identical neither to the essential realm of God nor to the essential realm
of man, who, however, is again entering into a distinctive relationship with
this other place. The overman does not, and not ever, step into the place
of God; rather the place for the ovem1an's will is another realm of another

en the "madman" piece was written, comes

this note of Nietzsche's: "The time is coming when the battle for the mas­
tery of the earth will be fought - and fought in the name of fundamental
philosophical doctrines" (Werke, vol. XII , "Nachgelassene Werke," § 44 1).
This is not to say that the battle to exploit the earth without limit as
the domain of raw materials, and to employ "human resources" soberly
and without illusion in the service of the absolute empowering of the will to
power into its essence, explicitly makes usc of an appeal to a philosophy. We
should suppose the contrary: philosophy as the doctrine and as the structure
of culture is disappearing and in its current fonn can disappear, since it has
already (so far as it has been genuine) brought the reality of the real into
words and so has already brought beings as such into the history of their
being. lbe "fundamental philosophical doctrines" do not mean academic
doctrines but rather the language of the truth of beings as such, a truth that
is metaphysics itself in the shape of the metaphysics of the unconditional
subjcctity of the will to power.
In its historical essence, the battle for the' mastery over the earth is in fact
the consequence of the fact that beings as such appear in the mode of the will
to power, without, however, being recognized or at aU understood as this

OFF Ti l E B EATE:'-1" TRACK

will. At any rate, the concomitant doctrines of action and the ideologies of
representation never say what is and therefore happens. With the beginnings
of the battle for mastery of the earth, the age of subjcctity presses to its
completion. Its completion means that beings, which are in the sense of the
will to power, are becoming certain

[gewirs]

and therefore also conscious

[bewusst] of their own truth about themselves, each in its way in every respect.
To make something conscious is a necessary instrument of the will that wills
out of the will to power. It occurs, as regards the objectifying, in the form of
planning. It occurs in the region of man's uprising into self-willing through
the continuing analysis of the historical situation. Thought metaphysically,
the situation is always the station for the action of the subject. Whether it
knows it or not, each analysis of the situation is grounded on the metaphysics
of subjectity.
"The great noontide"7 is the time of the brightest brightness: namely,
the com;ciousness that has become unconditionally and in every respect
conscious of itself as that knowledge which consists of lrnowingly willing
the will to power as the being of beings; and, as such will, rebelliously to
withstand each necessary phase of the objectification of the world, and in
this way to secure the enduring duration

of beings

In the willing of this will,

however, the necessity comes upon man to will along with the conditions
of such willing. This means: to set values and esteem everything according
to values. In this manner, value determines all beings in their being. Which
brings us to the question:
What

ir

now, in the age when the unconditional mastery of the will

to power is manifestly dawning and when this manifestness and its public
character arc themselves becoming a function of this will? What is? We
are not asking about incidents and facts; in the realm of the will to power,
testimonies for any fact or incident are produced or dismissed at any time,
as required.
What is? We arc not asking about this or that being but about the being
of beings. Or rather: we are asking, what is going on with being itself? And
we are not asking this idly but in regard to the truth of beings as such, a
truth that is articulated verbally in the shape of the metaphysics of the will
to power. What is going on with being in the age when mastery begins to
be exercised by the unconditional will to power?
Being has become value. To make the duration of durables endure

is a condition that is set by

the will to power itself and that is necessary for securing the will to power.

NJF.TZSCI I E ' S

WOR D :

After all, how can being be more highly esteemed than through its express
elevation into value? And yet, by being appreciated as a value, being is dep­
recated as a mere condition set by the will to power itself. For ages now,
through having been esteemed at all and so appreciated, being has been
robbed of the worth of its essence. When the being of beings is stamped
as value and its essence is thereby sealed, then within this metaphysics (i.e.,
constantly within the truth of beings as such during this age) every path
toward the experience of being itself is obliterated. In this manner of speak­
ing, perhaps we are presuming what we must by no means presume: that
such a path toward being ever existed and that a thinking about being has
ever thought being as being.
Oblivious of being and of its own truth, Western thinking since its be­
ginning has constantly thought beings as such. During that time, it has
thought being only in the kind of truth that verbalizes the name "being"
rather awkwardly and also ambiguously, since the multiplicity of its mean­
ing is not known by experience. This thinking that has remained oblivious
of being itself is the simple and all-bearing (and for that reason enigmatic
and unexperienced) event of Western history, which meanwhile is about to
expand itself into world-history. In the end, being has sunk down to a value
in metaphysics. This shows that being is not permitted as being. What does
that mean?
What is going on with being? With being nothing is going on. And
what if it is only in that nothing that the formerly disguised essence of
nihilism announces itself? Would thinking in values then be pure nihilism?
But yet Nietz.o;che grasps the metaphysics of the will to power precisely
as the overcoming of nihilism. And indeed, the metaphysics of the will to
power is an overcoming of nihilism - provided that nihilism is understood
only as the devaluation of the highest values and the will to power as the
principle of the revaluation of all values on the basis of a new dispensation of
values. However, in this overcoming of nihilism, value-thinking is elevated
into a principle.
If, however, value docs not let being be being,8 be that which it is as being
itself, then what was supposed to be the overcoming is but the completion
of nihilism. For metaphysics now not only fails to think being itself, but
this failure is veiled under the guise of appearing to think being in the most
worthy way, by esteeming it as value, with the result that all questions about
being become and remain superfluous. If; however, the thinking that thinks
•

First edition, 1950. What does "being" mean here?

1 93

OFF THE BEATE:'I: TRACK

everything according to values is nihilism when thought in relation to being
itself, then even Nietzsche's experience of nihilism as the devaluation of the
highest values is still nihilistic. The interpretation of the superscnsory world,
the interpretation of God as the highest value is not thought on the basis of
being itself. The final blow against God and against the supersensory world
consists in reducing God, the beingness of beings

[das Seiende des Seienden],

to the highest value. The harshest blow against God is not that God is held
to be unknowable, nor that God's existence is proved to he unprovable, but
rather that the God who is taken for real is elevated to the highest value. This
blow is the harshest precisely because it docs not come from unbelievers
standing about, but from the faithful and their theologians, who talk of the
beingmost of all beings without ever Letting it occur to them to think about
being itself and thereby become aware that this thinking and that talking,
from the perspective of the faith, is absolute blasphemy when it is mixed
into the theology of the faith.
Only now has even a faint light come into the darkness of the question
that we had wanted to put to Nietzsche when we were listening

to

the

passage about the madman: how can it really happen that men are capable of
ever killing God? Obviously, however, this is exactly what Nietzsche thinks.
For in the entire passage only two sentences are specifically emphasired by

" We killed him," that is, God. The other: "a11d yet
they have d()11e it themselves," that is, men did commit the act of the kiJiing of

italics. The first reads:

God, although they had not yet heard anything about it to that day.
The two emphasized sentences give the interpretation for the word "God
is dead." It does not mean (as it would if spoken from denial and a low
hatred): there is no God. The word means something more dire: God has
been killed. It is only in this way that the critical thought comes to light.
However, understanding it has become even more difficult. For the word
"God is dead" would be far more readily understood if it announced: of his
own will God himself removed himself from living presence. But that God is
supposed to be killed by others, and by men at that, is unthinkable. Nietz.o;che
himself is surprised by this thought. That is why, immediately after the
critical declaration " We've killed him - you and I. We arc all his murderers!",
he has the madman ask: "But how have we done this?" Nietzsche clarifies
the question by repeating it in three images: "How were we able to drink
the sea dry? Who gave tiS the sponge to wipe the entire horizon away? What
did we do when we unchained this earth from its sun?"
We could offer this answer to the last question: what men did when
they unchained the earth from its sun is told by the European history of

1 94

;\JlETZSCHE'S WO R D : "GOD IS DEAD"

the last three and a half cenruries. But what has happened, in the ground
of this history, with beings? When he cites the relationship between earth
and sun, Nietzsche is not just thinking of the Copernican revolution in
the modem conception of science. The word "sun" will also remind us
of Plato's parable. According to the parable, the sun and the realm of its
light are the surroundings in which beings appear in accordance with their
appearance, in accordance with their visible aspect (in accordance with the
ideas). The sun forms and delimits the field of vision in which beings show
themselves as beings. The "horizon" means the supersensory world as the
one that truly is. This is at the same time the entirety that embraces and
includes everything in itselflike the sea. The earth as the residence of man is
unchained from its sun. The realm of the supersensory which has its being
in itself [an sich seiende11] is no longer the normative light above man. The
whole field of \�sian has been wiped away. The entirety of beings as such,
the sea, has been drunk dry by men. For man has risen up into the 1-hood
of the ego cogito. Wtth this uprising all beings become objects. As what is
objective, beings are swallowed up into the immanence of subjectivity. The
horiwn no longer illuminates of itself. It is now only the viewpoint set in
the dispensation of value of the will to power.
With the help of these three images, "sun, horiwn, sea" (which, for
our thinking, are probably something quite other than images), the three
questions explain what is meant by the event in which God is killed. This
killing means the elimination, through man, of the supersensory world that
has its being in itself. This killing identifies the process in which beings as
such arc not absolutely annihilated, but rather become otherwise in their
being. However, in this process, man too, and above all, becomes other­
wise. He becomes the one who eliminates beings in the sense of beings
in themselves [des an sich Seienden]. 'The human uprising into subjectivity
makes beings into objects. However, what is objective is that which, through
representation, has been brought to a stand. The elimination of beings in
themselves, the killing of God, is accomplished in the securing of duration
[Bestandsicherrmg] through which man secures bodily, material, spirirual,
and intellecrual durables [Bestiitlde]; however, these are secured for the sake
of man's own security, which wills the mastery over beings (as potentially
objective), in order to conform to the being of beings, the will to power.
Securement, as the obtaining of security, is grounding in the dispensation
of value. Setting, dispensing, values has killed beneath itself all beings in
themselves, thereby doing away with them as beings for themselves. This
final blow in the murder of God is struck by metaphysics, which as the

OFF THE B r�ATEK TRACK

metaphysics of the will to power accomplishes thinking in the sense of
value-thinking. Yet this final blow, through which being is struck down
to a mere value, is no longer recognized by Nietzsche himself for what
that blow is when it is thought in relation to being itself. But does not
Nietzsche himself say: "We arc all his murderers - you and I"? Of course;
Nietzsche, accordingly, still conceives even the metaphysics of the will to
power as nihilism. To be sure; but for Nietzsche that only means that as
the countennovement in the sense of the revaluation of all former values,
this metaphysics accomplishes the antecedent "devaluation of the fonner
highest values" most intensely because it does so with finality.
Yet it is precisely this new dispensation of value, based on the principle of
all dispensations of value, that Nietzsche must no longer think as a killing
and a nihilism. In the field of vision of the will to power that wills itself, i.e.,
in the perspective of value and the dispensation of value, it is no longer a
devaluation.
But what goes on with value-setting itself, when it is thought in regard
to beings as such, i.e., at the same time on the basis of the regard to being?
Then, to think in values is to kill radically. It not only strikes down beings
as such in their being-in-themselves

[An-sich-sein] ,

but it also puts being

entirely aside. Being, when it is still needed, is taken to be value only. The
value-thinking of the metaphysics of the will to power is deadly in an extreme
sense because it does not permit being itself to come into the dawning, i.e.,
the vitality, of its essence. 'Ia think in accordance with values forestalls being
itself from coming to essential presence in its truth.
But is this killing at the roots primarily or exclusively the nature of the
metaphysics of the will to power? Is it merely the interpretation of being
as value that does not let being itself be the being that it is? If this were the
case, then the metaphysics of pre-:\"ietzschean epochs would have to have
experienced and thought being itself i n its truth or at least have asked about
iL

Bm nowhere do U'efind such experimce ofbeing itself. Nowhere do we meet a

thinking that thinks the truth of being itself and thereby truth itself as being.
This is not thought even where pre-Platonic thinking, as the beginning of
Western thinking, prepares for the unfolding of metaphysics by Plato and
Aristotle. The

ecrTIV (i:ov) yap eTva1K does indeed name being itself. But to

think of presencing as prcsencing out of the truth of presencing is precisely
what it docs not do. The history of being begins - nece..<;sarily begins

with the forgottenness of being.

-

So it is not the fault of metaphysics as the

metaphysics of the will to power tl1at being itself remains unthought in its
truth. This strange staying-absent of being is then the sole responsibility of

"ti; I ETZSCHE'S WORD: "GOL> IS DEAlY'

metaphysics as metaphysics. Yet what is metaphysics? Do we know its
essence? Is it itself able to know this essence? When it comprehends its
essence, it grasps it metaphysically. But the metaphysical concept of meta­
physics continually lags behind its essence. The same is true of every logic,
assuming that logic is still in fact able to

think what Myos is. Every meta­

physics of metaphysics and every logic of philosophy that attempt in what­
ever way to clamber past metaphysics most certainly fall down beneath it,
without coming to know in the process where they have fallen to.
In the meantime, however, at least one trait of the essence of nihilism has
become clearer in our thought. The essence of nihilism is rooted in history;
accordingly, there is nothing in the appearance of beings as such in their
entirety that is going on with being itself and its truth; indeed, as a result,
the truth of beings as such is taken as being, since the truth of being stays
absent. Nietzsche indeed came to know, in the age in which nihilism was
beginning to be completed, some of the traits of nihilism, but at the same
time he interpreted them nihilistically, thereby completely burying their
essence. Niev..sche never recognized the essence of nihilism, like every other
metaphysics before him.
However, if the essence of nihilism is rooted in the history that in the
appearance of beings as such in their entirety the truth of beings stays absent,
and if accordingly there is nothing going on with being itself and the truth
of being, then metaphysics, as the history of the truth of beings as such in
their essence, is nothing. If in the end metaphysics is the historical ground
of the world history that is being determined by the West and by Europe,
then it is nihilistic in quite another sense.
Thought in terms of the destiny of being, the nibil of nihilism means that
there is nothing going on with being. Being does not come to the light of
its own essence. In the appearance of beings as such, being itself stays away.
The truth of being escapes

us.

It remains forgotten.

So nihilism then would be in its essence a history that happens with
being itself. It would lie then in the essence of being itself that being remains
unthought because it removes itself. Being itself removes itself into its truth.

of

it'i own essence, perhaps we catch a glimpse of the essence of the mystery
in which the truth of being essences.
Accordingly, metaphysics itself would not be simply overlooking a ques­
tion about being that is stiJI to be reflected upon. In the end it would not be

an error. Metaphysics, as the history of the truth of beings as such, would be
what came to be out of the destiny of being itself. In its essence metaphysics
would be the unthought - because withheld - mystery of being itself. Were
it otherwise, a thinking that diligently holds to what must be thought, to
being, could not ceaselessly ask: What is metaphysics?
Metaphysics is an• epoch of the history of being itself. In its essence,
however, metaphysics is nihilism. The essence of nihilism is part of the
history in which, as which, being itself essences. If the nothing, wherever
else it points, also points to being, then it may well be more likely that
the being-historical determination of nihilism shows the region, at least,
within which the essence of nihilism is able to be experienced, in order to
become something that is thought

[etwas Gedachtes],

something that con­

cerns our remembrance [A11denken]. We are very much accustomed to hear a
discordant note in the name nihilism. However, as soon as we reflect on the
being-historical essence of nihilism, then something discomfiting is added
to our merely hearing a discordant note. The name nihilism says that the

nihil (the nothing) is, and is in

an essential way, in what it names. Nihilism

means: with everything in every respect, the nothing is going on. Every­
thing: beings in their entirety. Moreover, a particular being

[das Seiende],

when it is experienced as a particular being, stands in each of its respects.
Nihilism means, then, that the nothing is going on with beings as such in
their entirety. But beings are what they are and how they are on the ba­
sis of being. Provided that every "is" is the responsibility of being, then
the essence of nihilism consists in the fact that there is nothing going on
with being itself. Being

itself is

being in its

truth,

which truth belongs to

being.
If we hear in the name nihilism that other note, in which there sounds the
essence of what it names, then we also hear differently into the language of
the metaphysical thinking that has experienced something of nihilism but
without being able to think its essence. Perhaps with that other note in our
car, we will one day think differently than we have so far about the age in
which nihilism was beginning to be completed. Perhaps we will then rec­
ogni7.e that neither sociological, nor technological, nor scientific, nor even
metaphysical and religious perspectives are enough to think what is hap­
pening in this age. What there is for thinking to think is not some deeply
hidden deeper meaning, but rather something lying close by: something
that is lying most closely, which we, because that is all it is, have therefore

continually already passed over. By passing it over, we continually accom­
plish (without attending to it) that killing of the being of beings.
In order to attend to it and to hear how to attend to it, it must already
suffice for us to think for once about what the madman says of the death of
God and how he says it. Perhaps we will now no longer overlook in a rush
what is said at the beginning of the passage we discussed - that the madman
"cried out ceasele.'iSiy: I'm looking for God! I'm looking for God!"
In what way is this man mad? He is de-ranged [Ver-riickt] . l ie is moved
out [ausgeriickt] of the level of erstwhile man on which the ideals, now grown
unreal, of the supersensory world are passed off as real while the opposite
ideals are being realized. This de-ranged man is moved out (hinausgeriicktl
beyond erstwhile man. In moving out, nonetheless, he has only fully moved
into (eingeriickt] the predetennined essence of erstwhile man, to be the ani­
mal rati011ale. The man de-ranged in this way has, then, nothing in common
with the sort of men standing about in public, "who do not believe in God."
For these are not unbelievers because for them God, as God, has become
unworthy of belief, but because they themselves have abandoned the pos­
sibility of faith since they arc no longer able to seek God. They can seek
no longer because they can no longer think. Those standing about in pub­
lic have abolished thinking and replaced it with gossip that smells nihilism
everywhere it fears its opinions are threatened. The self-delusion, which is
perpetually gaining the upper hand against genuine nihilism, is trying in
this way to talk away its dread at thinking. This dread, however, is dread
at dread.
It is clear from the first sentences and even clearer for those who can
hear from the last sentences of the passage that the madman, in contrast,
is seeking God by crying out after God. Perhaps a thinking man has here
really cried out de profimdis? And the ear of our thinking? Does it not still
hear the cry? It will not hear the cry so long as it does not begin to think.
Thinking does not begin until we have come to know that the reason that
has been extolled for centuries is the most stubborn adversary of thinking.

Why Poets?

" . . . and why poets in a desolate time?" Holderlin asks in the elegy "Bread
and Wine." Today we hardly understand the question. How are we ever
going to grasp the answer that Holderlin gives?
" . . . and why poets in a desolate time?" The word "time" here means
the age to which we ourselves still belong. The appearance and sacrificial
death of Christ, for the historical experience of Holderlin, mean that the
end to the days of divinity has set in. Evening is falling. Since the "united
three,"' Herakles, Dionysus, and Christ, forsook the world, the evening of
the world-era has been drawing to its night. The world's night disseminates
its darkness. The age is determined by God's keeping himself afar, by "God's
default."1 However, the default of God which Holderlin experienced does
not contradict the fact that a Christian relationship to God continues among
individuals and in the churches, and it certainly does not disparage this
relationship to God. The default of God means that a God no longer gathers
men and things to himself visibly and unmistakably and from this gathering
ordains world-history and man's stay within it. However, in the default of
God notice is given of something even worse. Not only have the gods and
God fled, but the radiance of divinity is extinguished in world-history. The
time of the world's night is the de.'iolate time because the desolation grows
continually greater. The time has already become so desolate that it is no
longer able to see the default of C'..od as a default.
With this default, the ground for the world ceases to be grounding. Abyss

level, something hangs down a declivity.

200

WHY POETS?

this desolate time, it can only come one day if the world turns radically
around, which now plainly means if it turns away from the abyss. In the age
of the world's night, the abyss of the world must be experienced and must
be endured. However, for this it is necessary that there are those who reach
into the abyss.
The turning of an age does not occur at just any time by the eruption of
a new God or by the new eruption of an old God from an ambush. \Vhere
is he supposed to turn to, upon his return, if men have not already prepared
for him his residence? How could there ever be for God a residence fit for
God unless the radiance of divinity had already begun to appear in all that is?
The gods who "once were here" "return" only "at the proper time"J namely, when there is a turn among men in the right place in the right way.
That is why Holderlin says in the unfinished hymn "Mnemosyne"4 (written
shortly after the elegy "Bread and Wine"):
All things arc not
Within the power of heavenly ones. That is,
Mortals first reach into the abyss. For so it turns
with them. The time is

Long is the desolate time of the world's night. It reaches
midpoint only at length

[gelangen]

its

[lang]. In the midnight of this night, the desolation

of the time is the greatest. The destitute time is then no longer able even to
experience its distress. This incapacity, by which even the distress of deso­
lation sinks into darkness, is the very desolation of the time. The distress is
fully eclipsed because it now appears only as a need to be satisfied. Nonethe­
less, the world's night is to be thought as a destiny that takes place this side
of pessimism and optimism. Perhaps the world's night is now approaching
its midpoint. Perhaps the time of the world is now fully becoming a desolate
time. Perhaps not, however, not yet, still not yet, despite the immeasurable
hardship, despite aU the sufferings, despite the indescribable sorrow, despite
the incessant rampant disquiet, despite the mounting confusion. The time
is long because even terror, treated in itself as a ground for a tum, can do

201

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

nothing as long as there is no tum among mortals. It turns, however, only
when mortals come into their own essence. Their essence is based on the
fact that they arc the ones who reach into the abyss, rather than the gods.
Mortals keep closer to absence (if we think of their essence) because they
are concerned by presence, the name of being since antiquity. But since
presence simultaneously conceals [verbirgt] itself, it is itself already absence.
The abyss, therefore, save.c; (birgt] and observes (merkt] everything. In his
hymn "The Tttans," Holdcrlin calls the abyss "all-observing."S The mortal
who is to reach into the abyss rather than or differently from others expe­
riences the marks (Merkma/e] that the abyss observes (vemzerkt]. These, for
the poet, are the tracks of the fugitive gods.6 This track, in lloldcrlin's
experience, is what Dionysus, the wine-god, brings down for the God-less
during the darkness of their world's night. For the god of the vine preserves
in it and in its fruit the essential mutuality of earth and sky as the site of
the nuptials of men and gods.7 Only within this site, if anywhere, can the
tracks of the fugitive gods yet abide for God-less men .
. . . and why poets in a desolate time?
. . . und wozu Dichter in diirftiger Zeit?

I Ii>ldcrlin answers shyly through the mouth of his friend, the poet
I Icinze, to whom the question was addressed:
They arc, you say, like the wine-god's sacred priests,
\Vho roamed from land to land during the sacred night.
Aber sic sind, sagst du, wie des Wcingotts heilige Priester,
Welche von Lande zu Land zogen in hcilige Nacht.

Poets are the mortals who gravely sing the wine-god and sense (spiiren]
the track [Spur] of the fugitive gods; they stay on the gods' track, and so they
blaze [spu1-en] a path for their mortal relations, a path toward the turning
point. However, the aether, in which alone gods are gods, is their godhead.
The element of this aethcr, that in which the godhead itself still essences, is
the sacred. The element of the aether for the advent of the fugitive gods, the
sacred, is the track of the fugitive gods. Yet who is capable of tracing such
tracks? Tracks are often inconspicuous, and they are always the legacy of
instruction scarcely divined. To be a poet in a desolate time means: singing,
to attend to the track of the fugitive gods. This is why the poet, at the time
of the world's night, utters the sacred. This is the reason that the world's
night, in Holderlin's language, is the sacred night.

202

Wi l Y

POETS?

It is in the essence of poets who are truly poets at such a world-era that
from out of the desolation of the time, the condition and vocation of the
poet have first become poetic questions for them. That is why "poets in a
desolate time" must specifically speak the essence of poetry in their poems.
\Vhere this happens we may infer that the condition of the poet accords
[s. �·chicktl with the destiny [Geschick] of the age. The rest of us must learn
to listen to what these poets say - which assumes that we arc not deceiving
ourselves about the time that conceals lvt'1·bi1J{t] being by saving [birgt] it;
deceiving ourselves, that is, into calculating the time only on the basis of
beings, by dissecting them.
The closer it comes to the midnight of the world's night, the more ex­
clusively desolation reigns in such a way that it withdraws its essence. It is
not only that the sacred is vanishing as the track to the godhead, but that
even the tracks to this lost track are almost erased. The more the track.c; are
effaced, the less an individual mortal who reaches into the abyss can still
attend there to a hint or instruction. Then it is true all the more that each
person gets farthest if he is able to go as far as he can along the way granted
to him. The third strophe of the same elegy that asks "and why poets in a
desolate time?" pronounces the law which governs its poets:
One thing is certain; whether at noon or late,
"Ioward the middle of the night, a measure endures,
Common to all, though each also is granted his own,
\Vhere we come and where we go to, as we can.
Fest blcibt Eins; es sei um Mittag odcr es gehe
Bis in die Mittemacht, immer bestcht ein Maas,
Allen gemein, doch jeglichem auch ist eignes beschieden,
Dahin gehet und kommt jeder, wohin er es kann.

In his letter to Boehlendorf on December 2, 1 802 , Holderlin writes: "and
the philosophical light around my window is now my joy; may I preserve
the memory of how I have come thus far."
The poet thinks into the place that is determined from that illumi­
nation of being which has been stamped as the realm in which Western
metaphysics is fulfilled. Holderlin's thinking poetry has also stamped this
realm of the poetic thinking. His poetry dwells in this place more inti­
mately than any other poetry of his time. The place into which Holderlin
came is one where being is manifest, a ma'nifesmess which itself belongs in
the destiny of being; out of this destiny, the manifesmess is intended for
the poet.

203

OFF THE BEATEI': TRACK

Perhaps, however, this manifestness of being within the fulfillment of
metaphysics is simultaneously the extreme oblivion of being. What if this
oblivion were the concealed essence of the desolation of the desolateness of
the time? Then there would certainly be no time for an aesthetic flight to
Holderlin's poetry. Then it would not be the moment to fabricate a myth
out of the figure of the poet. There would be no chance then to mistreat his
poem as a rich storehouse for a philosophy. However, there would be and
there is the single necessity: by thinking soberly in what is said in his poetry,
to experience what is unsaid. This is the course of the history of being.
If we enter upon this course, it brings thinking and poetry together in a
dialogue engaged with the history of being. Researchers in literary history
will inevitably see the dialogue as an unscholarly violation of what they take
to be the facts. Philosophers will see it as a baffled descent into mysticism

[ein Abweg der Ratlosigkeit in die Schwiimzeretl. I Iowever, destiny pursues its
course untroubled by all that.
Does a poet of today encounter us of today on this course? Does that very
poet encounter us, a poet who today is often and hastily dragged into the
vicinity of thinking and plastered over with a good deal of half-thought-out
philosophy? Yet let us ask this question more clearly with the stringency
appropriate to it.
Is Rainer Maria Rilke a poet in a desolate time? How does his poetry
bear on the desolateness of the time? How far docs it reach into the abyss?
Where is it that he comes to, assuming he goes to where he can?
Rilke's valid poems stretch across two slim volumes, patiently collected:
the

Dttillo Elegies and

the

Sonnets to Orpheus.

The long path to these po­

ems is itself a path of poetic questioning. En route Rilkc experiences the
desolatcness of the age more clearly. The age is desolate not only because
God is dead but also because mortals scarcely know or are capable even of
their own mortality. Mortals are still not in the possession of their essence.
Death withdraws into the enigmatic. The mystery of suffering is covered
over. No one is learning to love. But mortals are. They are so long as there
is language. Song still lingers over their desolate land. The singer's words
stay on the track of the sacred. A song from the

Sonnets to Orpheus says it

( I , • 9):

What though the world changes swiftly
like shapes of the clouds,
all that is finished falls home
to the primeval.

204

Wi lY POETS?

Above the passage and change,
more wide and more free,
your foresong yet endures,

Sufferings arc not recognized,
no one is learning to love,
and what in death displaces us
is unrevealed.
Over the land only song
sanctifies and celebrates.

Uber dem Wandel

Gott mit dcr Leier.
Nicht sind die Leiden erkannt,
nicht ist die Liebe gclernt,
und was im Tod uns enfernt
ist nicht entschleiert.
Einzig das Lied iiberm Land
heiligt und feiert.

Meanwhile even the track of the sacred has become unrecognizable. It
is an open question whether we still experience the sacred as the track to
the godhead of the divine, or whether what we now encounter is only a
track to the sacred. It is not clear what this track to a track could be. It is
questionable how such a track would show itself to us.
The time is desolate because it lacks the unhiddenness of the essence of
pain, death, and love. This desolation is itself desolate because the essential
realm in which pain and death and love belong together is withdrawn.
Hiddenness exists so long as the realm where they belong together is the
abyss of being. I lowever, song still remains and gives a name to the land.
What is song itself? How is a mortal capable of it? Where does song sing
from? l low far does it reach into the abyss?
In order to judge whether or to what ·extent Rilke is a poet in a desolate
time, in order therefore to know what poets are for, we will try to set a few
stakes on the path to the abyss. For stakes we will take a few basic words of

OFF Tl IE BEATEK TRACK

Rilke's valid poetry. They are to be understood only in relation to the realm
out of which they are spoken. That realm is the truth of beings as it has
developed since the fulfillment of Western metaphysics by Nietzsche. Rilke
experienced poetically and bore in his own way the unhiddenness of beings
which was stamped by this fulfillment. We will see how beings as such, for
Rilke, show themselves in their entirety. In order to bring this realm into
view, we will attend to a poem that was written in the vicinity of Rilke's fully
accomplished poetry and after it chronologically.
We are not prepared to interpret the elegies and sonnets, for the realm
from which they speak has, in its metaphysical condition and oneness, not
yet been sufficiently thought from out of the essence of metaphysics. For
two reasons this thinking is difficult. First, because Rilke's poetry, in its
course within the history of being, remains behind I lolderlin in rank and
position. Next, because we scarcely know the essence of metaphysics and
are unversed in what being says.
Not only arc we not prepared to interpret the elegies and sonnets, but we
are not entitled to do so, since the essential realm of the dialogue between
poetry and thinking

can

be reconnoitered, attained, and thought through

only slowly. Who today would claim that he is equally at home in the
essence of thinking and in the essence of poetry? And even more, that he is
powerful enough to bring the essence of both into extreme discord in order
to establish their concordance?
Rilke did not himself publish the poem that we will explicate below.
It is found on page 1 1 R of the volume of the
published in

Gesammelte Gedichte that was
19 34 and on page 90 of the collection Spiite Gedichte (published

in 1 93 5). The poem has no heading. Rilke drafted it in June 1 924. ln a letter
to Clara Rilke on August 1 5, 1 924 from Muzot, the poet writes: "However,
I have not been dilatory and remiss in
Lucius received his fine Malte

all directions, fortunately: Baron
even before my departure in June; his letter

of tltanks has long been ready to be sent off to you. I also enclose for you
the improvised verses which I inscribed for him in the first volume of the
handsome leather edition."
The improvised verses which Rilke mentions in this letter (according
to a note by the editor of the

Brieft

ntiS

Muzot,

on p. 404) constitute the

following poem:

of our being; it risks us. Only that we,
still more than plant or animal,
go with this risk, will it, sometimes even
risk more (and not from self-interest),
than life itself does, by a breath
risk more . . . This fashions us, outside of all defense,
a safebeing, there where the gravi ty

of the pure forces takes effect; what saves us at last
is our defenselessness and that seeing it threaten
we turned it into the open

Rilke refers to the poem as "improvised verses." I lowever, this unforeseen
quality opens up for

us

a point of view from which we will be able to think

Rilke's poetry more clearly. Admittedly, the first thing we must learn at this
moment of world history is that making poems is also a matter of thinking.

We will take the poem as a practice exercise in poetic reflection.

The structure of the poem is simple. It is clearly articulated in four parts:
lines r-s. lines 5-1o, lines Icr12, and lines 1 2-r6. Corresponding to the
beginning

"As nature . . . " is the "so we too . . . " of lines 4-5. The "Only"

of line 5 subsequently refers back to this "we." "Only" has a restrictive
force, but in a way that marks a distinctive quality, which is made explicit in
lines s- 1 0. Lines

l{rl

2 state the potential of this distinction. What it really

consists of is thought in lines 1 2-16.

207

OFF T i l E B EATE:"J TRACK

Through the "As . . so" at the beginning, human being enters as the
theme of the poem. Human being is contrasted with creatures. These are
the living beings, plant and animal. The beginning of the eighth Dttino
E/erzy, making the same comparison, H calls living beings by the name of
"creature."
A comparison sets different things together as equals, in order to make
the difference between them evident. They are equal, these different beings,
plant and animal on the one hand, human on the other, provided they agree
in what is the same. \Vhat is the same is the relationship they have as beings
to their ground. The ground of creatures is nature. The ground of men is not
merely of the same kind as the ground of plant and animal. In both cases the
ground is the same. It is nature as "full Nature" (Sonnets to Orpheus II, 1 3).
We must think Nature here in the wide and essential sense in which
Leibniz used the capitalized word "Natura." It means the being of beings.
It essences as the vis primitiva activo. This is the potential to begin which
gathers everything to itself, but in such a way that it releases all beings
to their own selves. The being of beings is the will. The will is the self­
mustering gathering of each ens to itself. All beings are, as beings, in the will.
They are as things willed. Do not misunderstand: beings are not primarily
and only as things willed; rather they are, so long as they are, themselves in
the mode of willing. Only as things willed are they what wills in the will,
each in its own way.
\Vhat Rilke calls Nature is not set off against history. Above all it is not
understood as the objective domain of the natural sciences. Nor is Nature
opposed to art. It is the ground for history and art and for nature in the
narrower sense. In the word Nature as it is used here, the echo still lingers
of the earlier word cjiVOIS, which is also equated with t;;w,;, translated by us
as life. In early thought, the essence of life is not represented biologically
but rather as cjlvats, the emergent, that which arises. In the poem, "Nature"
is also called "life" in line 9· Here, Nature, life indicate being in the sense
of beings in their entirety. Niet7.sche once wrote in a note from x 88s-86
(The Will to Power, no. 582): "being - we have no conception of it other than
'life'. - How then can something dead 'be'?"
.

Rilke calls Nature, as the ground of the beings which we ourselves are, the
uunost source (Urgrund]. This indicates that men reach further into the
ground of beings than other beings. Since antiquity, the ground of beings
has been called being. The relation of being that grounds to beings that are
grounded is the same with men on the one hand and with plants and animals
208

WHY POETS?

on the other. It is a matter in each case of being giving beings over to the risk.
Being let.'i beings loose into the risk. This letting-loose that casts off is the
actual risking. The being of beings is the relation of casting-off to beings.
The beings that arc at a particular time are what is being risked. Being is
preeminently the risk. It risks us, human beings. It risks living beings. Beings
are so long as they remain what is continually being risked. Beings, however,
are still risked into being, that is, into a risk. That is why beings, given over
to the risk, themselves run risks. Beings are by going with the risk into which
they are let loose. The being ofbeings is the risk. This risk is based in the will,
which, since Leibniz, has shown itselfmore clearly as the being of beings that
is revealed in metaphysics. The will that it is necessary to think here is not the
abstract generalization of willing as it is psychologically understood. Rather,
hwnan willing, experienced metaphysically, is only the willed counterpart
to will as to the being of beings. So long as Rilke represents Nature as the
risk, he is thinking of it metaphysically in tcnns of the essence of the will.
This essence still conceals itself, both in the will to power as in the will as
the risk. Will essences as the will to will.
The poem does not say anything directly about the ground of beings,
that is about being as preeminently the risk. But if being as the risk is the
relation of casting-off, and i f it therefore retains even what is risked in the
casting-off, then the poem tells us something indirectly about the risk by
speaking of what is risked.
Nature risks living beings and "shelters none in particular." Likewise,
neither are we men, having been risked, "more dear" to the risk that is
risking us. In both cases, casting-off into danger is part of the risk. To risk
is to play with dangerous stakes. Heraclitus thinks of being as the world­
era and the world-era as a child's play (Fragment 52 in Diels,

Fragmente

der Vorrokratiker): Alwv nais ecrn nai�wv, maae\Jwv· nat5os ti 13aatAfllfl.
"The age of the world is a child playing a child's game; dominion is a
child's." Were what is cast off to remain out of danger, then it would not
be risked. Beings would be out of danger, however, if they were sheltered

schieflt vor) over the wall. In the countryside, we still say: the peasant is
"shooting in [schieflt ein]": she pushes [schiebt] molded dough into the oven

to bake. Shelter is pushed in advance and in front of. It prevents danger from
banning, or even concerning, the one under threat. To be sheltered is to

209

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

be entrusted to the sheltering. Instead of "entrusted," our older and richer
language would say "plighted" or "betrothed": loved, held dear. What is
unsheltered on the other hand is not more dear. Plant, animal, and man
have this in common: that as beings at aU, that is, as being risked, they are
not specially sheltered. Yet they are in fact distinguished in their being, and
therefore there will also be a difference in their unshelteredness.
Although the unsheltered are risked, they are nevertheless not aban­
doned. If they were, they would be as little risked as sheltered. Delivered only
unto annihilation, they would no longer hang in the balance [in der Uilge] .
In the Middle Ages the word " Uilge [balance]" still meant something al­
most like danger. To be in the balance means to be in a situation that can
tum out in one way or the other. That is why the instrument that moves
[bewegt] like this, by dipping one way or the other, is called the balance
[ Uilge] . It librates; it plays about the beam and plays itself out. The word
"Uilge [balance] " in the sense of danger and as the name of the instrument
is derived from wiigen, wegen, to make a way, that is, to go, to be going.
Be-wiigen means to get something underway, to get it going: wiegm (to sway
or weigh). Something weighs because it is able to tip the balance one way or
the other into the play of motion. What weighs has weight. To risk [wagen]
is to set the play into motion, to lay something on the balance [ Uilge] , to let
it loose into danger. Thereby what is risked is indeed unsheltered, but since
it lies on the balance, it is retained by the risk. It is sustained. It continues to
be saved by its ground in its ground. For beings, to be risked is to be willed;
retained in the will, they themselves remain in the mode of willing, and risk
themselves. In this way, what is risked is care-less, sine cttro, secttrum, that
is, safe. Only so long as what is risked rests safely in the risk, can it follow
the risk, follow it, that is, into the unshelteredness of what is risked. What
is risked is unsheltered; but not only does this not exclude a safebeing in its
ground, it necessarily implies it. What is risked goes with the risk.
Being, which holds all beings in the balance, therefore constantly attracts
beings toward and unto itself, unto itself as the center. Being, as the risk,
holds all beings, as risked, in tl1is relation of attraction. However, this center
of attractive relation retracts itself from all beings at the same time. In this
way the center gives beings over to the risk as which they are risked. In
this letting-loose that is a gathering, the metaphysical essence of the will,
thought in terms of being, conceals itself. The center of beings that attracts,
that mediates everything, the risk, is the faculty that lends a weight, iliat is,
heaviness, to what is risked. The risk is the force of gravity. A late poem,
entitled "Gravity," speaks about it (S'piite Gedichte, p. 1 56):

2 10

WHY POETS?

Gravity
Center, how you withdraw yourself
from everything, even from those who fly
you recover yourself, center, you, the strongest.
He, standing: as a drink
rushes through thirst, so gravity him.
Yet from the sleeper falls,
as from the low-hanging cloud,
ample rain of heaviness.
Scbwerkraft
Mitte, wie du au� allen
dich ziehst, auch noch aus Fliegenden dich

Stehender: wie ein lrank den Durst
durchstiirzt ihn die Schwerkraft.
Doch aus dem Schlafenden f.illt,
wie aus lagemdcr Wolke,
reichlicher Regen der Schwere.
Here what is called gravity is not the same as physical gravitation, which
is what we usually hear about; instead, it is the center of beings in their
entirety. Rilke calls it therefore "the unheard center"
II,

(Sonnets to Orpheus,

z8). The center is the ground, the fellowness, which by mediating holds

one thing to another and gathers everything in the game of risking. The
unheard center is "the eternal fellow-player"9 in the worldgame of being.
The same poem which speaks poetically of being as the risk calls (lines
1 1 and 1 z) the mediating attraction "the gravity of the pure forces." Pure

gravity, the unheard center of all risking, the eternal partner in the game of
being, is the risk.
By casting off what is risked, the risk simultaneously retains it in the
balance. Risk lets what is risked loose, indeed in such a way that it lets
loose what is cast off into none other than pull or traction

[Zug)

toward

the center. What is risked is vested with this traction toward the center.
In this pull, the risk always retrieves what is risked. To retrieve something,
to get hold of something from somewhere, to have it come, to attract it,
we call

"beziehen." This is the original meaning of the word "Bezttg." We
still speak of the "Bezug" of merchandise, salary, or current. The traction,

which as the risk concerns and affects all ·beings with traction, and retains
them in traction toward itself, is attraction
"dns

[Be:::;ug]

Bezug" is a fundamental word of Rilke's valid
211

absolutely. The word

poems; to be precise, in

OFF THE REATE� TRACK

the expressions "the pure Bezug," "the entire," "the real," "the clearest,"
and "the other Bezug" (i.e., the same attraction in another respect). 1 0
We only half understand Rilke's word "Bezug," which is to say that we
do not understand it at all in such a case when we grasp it only in tenns of
its current meaning of reference [Beziehung], and reference in the sense of
relation. We misinterpret the word to an even greater degree if we represent
the reference as the human "I" relating an object to itself. This meaning "to
relate to oneselr' comes later in the history of the language. Rilkc's use of
the word "der Bezui' is indeed also familiar with this meaning, but it does
not mean that primarily but only as derived from the original meaning. The
phrase "the whole Bezug" cannot even be thought if we represent Bezttg as
mere relation. The gravity of the pure forces, the unheard center, the pure
Bezug, the whole Bezug, full Nature, life, the risk are all the same.
All the names just offered name beings as such in their entirety. The
conventional idiom of metaphysics offers the name "being" for them as
well. According to the poem, Nature is to be thought as the risk. Here
the word "risk" simultaneously names the ground that risks and the risked
beings in their entirety. This ambiguity is not an accident, and it is not
enough to make a note of it. In it the language of metaphysics speaks
unambiguously.
Everything that is risked, as a particular kind of being, is admitted into
the entirety of beings and rests in the ground of the entirety. The particular
being in each case is each according to the attracting by which it is retained
in the traction of the whole attraction. The kind of attracting within the
attraction is the mode of the relationship toward the center as pure gravity.
That is why Nature is portrayed when one tells how the thing that is risked
is, each time, attracted into the traction toward the center. Accordingly,
each time it is then in the midst of beings in their entirety.
The whole attractive relation to which all beings (as beings that are
risked) are given over is what Rilke likes to call "the open." This is another
fundamental word of his poetry. In Rilke's language, "open" means that
which does not impede. It does not impede because it does not bar. It does
not bar because it is in itself free of all barriers. The open is the great
entirety of all that is unbarred. It lets the creatures that arc risked into the
pure attraction pull as things pulled, so that they draw onward together
in diverse ways without hitting against barriers. Pulling as they are pulled,
they open out in the unbarricred, into the infinite. They are not dissolved
[s . aujliisen ) into the void nothing, but they redeem [s. ein/Osen] themselves
into the whole of the open.

212

WHY POETS?

What Rilke is naming with this word "open" is in no way to be defined
by openness in the sense of the unhiddenness of beings, an unhiddenness
that lets beings as such come to presence. If we were to

try to interpret

Rilke's "open" in the sense of unhiddenness and the unbidden, then it would
be necessary to say: what Rilke experiences as the open is precisely the
hidden, the unlit, which draws onward in the unharriered in such a way
that there is no possibility of encountering something unusual or anything
at all. Wherever there is an encounter, there a barrier arises. Where there
is a barring, what is barred is forced back onto itself and so it is bent back
upon itself. Barring twists, cordons off, the relationship to the open and
makes this relationship itself into a twisted one. The barring within the
unbarricred is constructed

(er.rte/lt]

by human representation

The athwartness of objects that oppose him

(Vor.rte/len].
[Das gegenstehender Gegeniiber]

does not permit man to be directly in the open. It excludes man from the
world, in a certain sense, and places him before the world, where what is
meant by "world" is beings in their entirety. In contrast, it is the open itself
that has the quality of world; the open as the entirety of unopposingness,
unobjectiveness. However, even the term "the open," like the expression
"the risk," is ambiguous as a metaphysical term. It signifies both the entirety
of the unbarred attractions of the pure attraction and also openness in the
sense of the unbarring which prevails everywhere.
The open lets in. Letting in, however, does not mean: granting an en­
trance and access to what is closed,

as

though what is hidden were to un­

conceal itself so that it might appear as unbidden. To let in means: to draw
into and fit into the unlit entirety of the tuggings of the pure attraction.
To let in is the mode of the open, and it therefore has the character of an
attracting inclusion, in the manner of the gravity of the pure forces. The
less that admittance into the pure attraction is denied to what is risked, so
much the more does what is risked belong in the great entirety of the open.
That is why Rilkc calls creatures that are directly risked into this whole
and arc being swayed in it the "great-accustomed things"

(Spiite Gedichte,

p. 2 2 ). 1 1 Man is not one of them. The song that sings this different relation­
ship of living beings and of men to the open is the eighth

Duino Elegy. The

difference is based in the different degrees of consciousness. To distinguish
beings in this respect is, after Leibniz, familiar to modem metaphysics.
What Rilke is thinking with the word "the open" can be adduced from a
letter that he wrote in the last year of his life (February 2, 1926) in response
to a Russian reader who had asked him about the eighth elegy. (Cf. M. Bctz,

Rilke in Frankreich: E1·innenmgen, Briefe, Dokummte,
213

1 938, p. 289.) "You

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

must grasp the concept of the 'open' that I attempted
this elegy in

to

put forward in

sucb a way that the animal's degree of consciousness places it

into the world but without the animal placing itself each moment athwart

[gegenuber] the world (as we are); the animal is in the world; we stand before
it, because of the direction and intensifi<."ll tion that our consciousness has
characteristically taken." Rilke continues: "Neither is sky, air, and space
intended by the 'open'; for the observer and judge,

these

too are 'object

[Gegenstand] ' and therefore 'opaque' and shut. Animals, flowers, I suppose,
are all that, without having to account to themselves for it; and so they have
before and above them that indescribably open freedom which perhaps has
(at most momentary) equivalents among us only in the first moments of
love when a man sees in someone else, in the beloved, his own expanse, or
in his exaltation to God."
Plant and animal are admitted into the open. They arc

"in

the world."

The "in" means: attracted into the unlit attraction-nexus of the pure at­
traction. The relationship to the open (if we can still speak of a "to" at
all) is the unconscious one of a striving-drawing stride into the entirety
of beings. With the intensification of consciousness, the essence of which,
for modem metaphysics, is representation, the position
position

[Gegenstehen]

of objects

[Gegenstiinde]

[Stand]

and op­

also intensifies. The higher

the consciousness, the greater the degree to which the conscious crea­
ture is excluded from the world. That is why, in the words of the let­
ter, man is "before the world." He is not admitted into the open. Man
stands athwart the world. He does not live directly in the pull and wind of
the whole attraction. The quoted passage facilitates the understanding of
the open particularly since Rilke here expressly denies that the open may
be thought in the sense of the openness of sky and space. The open in
the sense of the essentially more original lightening of being is foreign to
Rilke's poetry, which remains moderately in the shadow of a Nictzschean
metaphysics.
That which has its proper place urunediatedly in the open is taken up

[eingenommen]

by it into the pull of attracting to the center. Therefore of

all the beings that are risked, the ones that belong most in the open

arc

[benonmzen] in accordance with their own essence, so that in
the resultant daze [Ben0111menheit] they never aspire to anything that could

taken away

stand in opposition to them. What so essences is "in dull desire."
A"' nature gives the creatures over
to the risk of dull de.<;ire . . .

214

WHY POETS?

Dull has here the sense of being muted: not breaking away from the
attraction-nexus of an unrestricted drawing onward which is not made un­
quiet by restless back-and-forth attraction - the state in which conscious
representation moves in excessive hurry. Dull means at the same time a dull,
muffled tone, which comes from a depth and has found a way of carrying.
Dull is not meant in the negative sense of stifling and oppressive. Rilke
does not think of dull desire as base and inferior. It testifies that the great­
accustomed things of Nature are part of the entirety of the pure attraction.
That is why Rilke can say in a late poem: "that for us the being of a flower
be great" (Spate Gedichte, p. 89; cf. Sonnets to Orpheus II, 14). As the passage
quoted from the letter thinks of man and living beings with regard to their
different relations [Verhiiltnis] of consciousness to the open, so the poem
names "creatures" and "us" (men) with regard to their different behavior
[ Verba/ten] toward the risk ( h . sff.):
. . . Only that we,
still more than plant or animal,
go with this risk, . . .

That man, still more than plant or animal, goes with the risk might
at first glance mean that man is admitted into the open with even less
hindrance than those creatures. If the "with" were not stressed with italics,
the "more" might very well imply exactly that. The stress of the "with" does
not indicate that man, with heightened freedom, goes along with the risk;
rather it means: for man, to go along with the risk is specifically represented,
and represented as something set before him [das J.i>rgesetze] in his intention
[J.i>ryatz]. The risk and what it has risked, Nature, beings in their entirety,
the world, are set out prominently [hemusgestellt] before man, from out of
the mutedness of unbarred attraction. But that which is set up [das Gestellte] where is it set up [gestellt], and by what? Nature is brought before man by
human re-presentation [Vo1'-Stellen]. Man sets up the world as the entirety
of objectiveness before himself and himself before the world. Man delivers
[stellt zu] the world unto himself and produces lstellt her] Nature for himself.
We must think ofthis production [Her-stellen] in its wide and diverse essence.
Man tills [bestellt] Nature when it does not satisfy his representation. Man
produces new things when they are lacking to him. Man rearranges [uvmellt]
things when they bother him. Man adjusts [s. verstellt] things when they
distract him from his plans. Man displays [aiwellt) things when he extols
them for sale and usc. Man displays himself when he emphasizes [hemtwellt]
his accomplishments and advertises his business. In manifold production,

215

OFF THE BEATEJ\' TRACK

the world is brought to a stop

[zum Stehen] and into position [in den Stand].

The open becomes an object and is diverted toward the human creature. It
is man who, athwart the world as an object,

turns

out to he

[s. heraustellt]

and displays himself as the one who deliberately assert" all this production.
To put something before oneself in such a way that what has been put
forth (and which has already been represented) determines all the modes of
production in every respect is a fundamental trait of the attitude we know
as the will. What is called will here is production, or rather production in
the sense of the deliberate self-assertion of objectification. Plant and animal
do not will since, muted in their desire, they never bring the open before
themselves as an object. They cannot go with the risk as with something
they had represented. Because they have been admitted into the open, the
pure attraction is never the objective other of themselves. Man on the other
hand goes

"with" the risk, because he is the creature who wills in the sense

we have given:
. . . Only that we,
still more than plant or animal,
go with this risk, will it, . . .

Will, in the sense given here, is the self-assertion whose intention

already posited

has

the world as the entirety of objects that can be produced.

This will determines the essence of modern man, without his having known

anything at first about its far-reaching consequences, and without his being
able to know even today the will which, as the being of beings, is the source

of this will that is willed. In such willing, modern man turns out to be the
one who surges up - in every relation to everything that is and therefore
also to himself - as the producer who asserts himself and establishes this
insurgency as absolute mastery. The whole inventory of objects, in which
guise the world appears, is entrusted to, enjoined upon, the production
that asserts itself, and so it is subordinated to the command of production.
Will has in itself the nature of command; for deliberate self-assertion is a
way in which the situation

[Gegenstandliche]

[ZUJtiindliche]

of producing and the objectivity

of the world muster themselves together in an absolute

and therefore complete

[vollrtandige]

oneness. In this self-mustering, the

imperative character of the will is announced. With it, in the course of
modern metaphysics, there comes to light the long-hidden essence of the
will that has long since been essencing as the being of beings.
Accordingly, human willing can also he in the mode of self-assertion
only by forcing everything into its realm in advance, even before it surveys

216

WHY POETS?

anything. For this will, everything, already in advance and therefore in
the consequence, is relentlessly turned into the material of self-asserting
production. Earth and its aonosphere are turned into raw material. Man
becomes a human material that is applied [angesetzt] to goals that have been
set out before him [vorgesetzt]. The absolute self-assertion of the deliberate
production of the world is unconditionally established as the condition of
human command; this is a process that comes out of the hidden essence of
technology. Only in the modern era does this begin to develop as a destiny
of the truth of beings in their entirety ; in contrast, until recently its scat­
tered appearances and efforts had been incorporated into the comprehensive
realm of culture and civilization.
Modern science and the total state, as necessary consequences [Folgen]
of the essence of technology, are also attendant [GtjOJge] upon it. The same
holds true for the ways and forms that are applied to the organization of
global public opinion and the ordinary ideas of people. Not only is life
objectified in the techniques of commercial breeding and exploitation, but
the attack of atomic physics upon the phenomena of life as such is going
full tilt. Fundamentally, the essence of life itself is to be handed over to
technical production. That people today in all seriousness find, in the re­
sults and the standpoint of atomic physics, possibilities of showing human
freedom and setting up a new theory of value, is a sign of the mastery of
technological representa tion. Such mastery has long since evolved far re­
moved from the precinct of individuals' personal views and opinions. The
essential force of technology is also shown where people are still trying, in
the vicinity as it were, to master technology with the help of the former
deployment of values: in these efforts they nonetheless avail themselves
of technical means which are by no means only outward forms. For in
general the use of machinery and the manufacturing of machines is not
technology itself, but rather only one of its appropriate instruments to es­
tablish its essence in the objectiveness of its raw material. Even this, the
fact that the man has turned into the subject and the world the object,
is a consequence of the self-establishing essence of technology, not the
reverse.
If Rilke experiences the open as the unobjectiveness of full Nature, by
contrast the world of willing men must stand out for him as correspondingly
objective. Conversely, to look out for the integral entirety of beings is to
take a hint from the phenomena of advancing technology, a hint in the
direction of those regions from where, perhaps, an originary, constructive
[bildende] overcoming of the technical could come.

past used to grow are rapidly dwindling away. They

can

no longer show

their own across the objectification. In a letter dated November I 3,

I 92.5,

Rilke writes:
Even for our grandparents a "house," a "spring," a familiar tower, yes even their
clothes, their coat: infinitely more and infinitely more intimate; each thing, almost,
a vessel in which they found the human, and preserved and added the human to

(Briefe aus Muzot, pp.

3 3 5f.).

However, this Americanness is already only the collected recoil of the
willed essence of modern Europe onto a Europe for which, in Nietzsche's
fulfillment of metaphysics, there were forethought some areas at least of
the essential questionableness of a world in which being has begun to rule
as the will to will. lt is not America that is the primary threat to us of today;
in fact the unexperienced essence of technology had already threatened
our ancestors and their things. What is significant in Rilke's reflection is
an attempt to rescue still the things of the forefathers. With even greater
forethought, we must recognize what it is that is becoming questionable
about the thingness of things. For Rilke writes even earlier from Duino on
March 1 , 1 9 1 2. : "The world withdraws into itself; and things, for their part,
behave in the same way, by transferring their existence increasingly into
the vibration of money and developing for themselves a kind of spirituality
there that even now exceeds their tangible reality. In the period that I

still metal, a lovely object, the handiest, the most lucid thing of all"

The objectiveness of technical domination over the earth is pushing in­
creasingly faster, more recklessly, and more totally into the place where
the worldly content of things used to give of itself freely since it used to
be safeguarded. The mastery not only sets up all beings as producibles in
the process of production, but it also delivers the products of production
through the market. What is human about humans and thingly about things
is dissolved, within the self-assertion of producing, to the calculation of the
market value of a market that is not only a global market spanning the earth
but that also, as the will to will, markets in the essence of being and so brings
all beings into the business of calculation, which dominates most fiercely
precisely where nwnbers are not needed.
Rilke's poem thinks man as the creature that is risked into a will that,
without yet experiencing it, is willed in the will to will. Willing in this way,
man can go with the risk in such a way that he thereby sets himself forth in
all that he docs as the one who asserts himself. Therefore man risks more

2 19

OFF THE BF.ATE� TRACK

than plant or animal. Accordingly he is also differently in danger than they
arc.
None of the creatures (plant and animal) arc particularly sheltered even
though they are admitted into the open and made secure in it. Man, in con­
trast, as the one who wills himself, is not merely not particularly sheltered
by the entirety of beings, but he is also outside of all defense (v.

I

3). As

the representer and the producer

[ Vot"- und Herstellende], he stands before
[vmtellte] open. Thereby he himself and his things arc ex­
posed [ausgesetzt] to the growing danger of becoming mere material, a mere
function of objectification. The intention [Vor.ratz] itself of self-assertion
[Sichdttt·chsetzen] expands the realm of the danger that man will lose his

the obstructed

own self to absolute producing. The threat which the human essence incurs
arises from this essence itself. However, this human essence is located in the
attraction of being to it. Therefore, by his self-willing, man in

ail

essential

sense is threatened, i.e., in need of defense, but by the nature of his essence,
he is at the same time defenseless.
This "our defenselessness" (v. I 3) differs from the not-particularly­
shclteredness of plants and animals in the same way that their dull desire
differs from the self-willing of man. The difference is an infinite difference
because there is no transition from dull desire to objectification in self­
assertion. However, not only does this put man "outside of all defense," but
also to assert the objectification of the world destroys, with increasing de­
cisiveness, even the possibility of defense. By setting up

[aujbaut] the world

technologically as an object, man blocks [s. verbaztt) willfully and completely
the way into the open that was already obstructed in any case. Whether he
as an individual knows it or not, wills it or not, self-asserting man is a func­
tionary of technology. lie not only stands before the open only from outside
it, but through the objectification of the world, he turns specifically away
from "the pure attraction." Man cuts himself off

[sich scheidet ab]

from the

pure attraction. Man in the age of technology stands, in such a departure

[Ab-schied], against the open. This departure is not a departure from . . . but
a departure against . . .
Technology is the absolute establishment (posed in man's self-assertion)
of the absolute defenselessness which is based on the turning away (which
dominates in aU objectivity) against the pure attraction, which as the un­
heard center of beings draws all the pure forces to itself. Technical pro­
duction is the organization of the departure. The word "departure," in the
meaning sketched just now, is another fundamental word of Rilke's valid
poetry.

2 20

WHY POETS?

It is not as a particular deadly machine that the much discussed atom
bomb is deadly. What has long threatened man with death, indeed with the
death of his essence, is the absoluteness of his sheer willing in the sense of his
deliberate self-assertion in everything. What threatens man in his essence
is the willful opinion that through the peaceful release, transformation,
stockpiling, and delivery of natural energies, man could make man's being
bearable for all and happy in general. However, the peace of this peaceful­
ness is merely the undisturbed, lasting frenzied restlessness of self-assertion
deliberately thrown back on itself. What threatens man in his essence is the
opinion that this assertion of production would be risked without danger if
only other interests in addition to it, perhaps those of a faith, remain valid
- as though the present relationship of our essence to the entirety of beings
(a relationship into which the technological mode of willing has shifted us)
could still be housed in some separate annex, some residence on the side
that would be able to offer more than temporary resorts to self-deception,
such as the flight to the Greek gods. What threatens man in his essence is
the opinion that technological production would bring the world into order,
when it is exactly this ordering that flattens out each ordo, that is, each rank,
into the uniformity of production and so destroys in advance the realm that
is the potential source from which rank and appreciation originate out of
being.
It is not only the fact that this willing has become total that is the danger;
rather, the danger is willing itself in the form of self-assertion within a

of this will has already decided on absolute command. With this decision
willing is already delivered into the service of total organization. Above
all, however, technology itself precludes any experience of its essence. For
while technology is being fully realized, it develops in science a knowledge
of a kind that is prevented from ever gaining access to the essential realm
of technology, let alone thinking back to its essential source.
The essence of technology is dawning only slowly. This day is the world's
night made over as the purely technological day. This day is the shortest
day. It raises the threat of a single endless winter. Man now forgoes not only

Wo aber die Gefahr ist, wachst
Das Rettende auch.

Perhaps any salvation other than that which comes from where the danger
lies is still within the unhealing unholiness. For man endangered in his
essence, any salvation by any makeshift, however well intended, is still an
empty sham for as long as his destiny endures. Salvation must come from
where there is a turn among mortals in their essence. Are there mortals
who first reach into the abyss of the desolate and desolation of the desolate?
These most mortal of mortals would be the most risked. They would risk
even more than the self-asserting human essence that already risks more
than plant and animal.
Rilke says in lines sff.:
. . . Only that we,
still more than plant or animal,
go with this risk, will it, . . .

And Rilke continues in the same line:
. . . sometimes even
risk more (and not from self-interest),
than life itself docs, by a breath
risk more . . .

Man not only in his essence risks more than plant and animal. Man, at
times, even risks more "than life irselfdoes." Life means here: beings in their
being: Nature. Man at times risks more than the risk, is more being than the
being of beings. I lowever, being is the ground of beings. Who risks more
than the ground risks himself to where all ground is lacking, into the abyss.
l lowever, if man is the one who, being risked, goes with the risk by willing
it, then men who sometimes risk even more must also will even more.
But can this willing be intensified beyond the absoluteness of deliberate

222

WHY POETS?

self-assertion? No. Those, then, who sometimes risk more can only be more
willing provided their willing is different in its essence. Then willing would
not at once be the same as willing. The ones who will to a greater degree
out of the essence of willing stay more in keeping with will as the being of
beings. They accord rather with being that shows itself as will. They will
more insofar as they are more willing. W ho arc the more willing ones, who
risk more? The poem, apparently, does not have an explicit answer to this
question.
Still, lines 8-1 o say something about the ones who risk more, by negation
and in approximate terms. Those who risk more do not risk themselves from
self-interest, for the sake of their own person. They arc attempting neither
to obtain an advantage nor to indulge in self-seeking. N either can they,
although they risk more, lay claim to an outstanding achievement. For they
only risk slightly more: "by a breath risk more." The "more" they risk is as
slight as a breath that remains fleeting and imperceptible. From such hints
it is not possible to identify who are the ones who risk more.
On the other hand, lines 1o-1 z say what this risk brings which is risked
out beyond the being of beings:
. . . This fashions us, outside of aU defense,
a safebeing, there where the gravity
of the pure forces takes effect;

We, like all creatures, are beings only by being risked in the risk of being.
Yet because we (as creatures who will) go with the risk, we are risked more
and so sooner given up to the danger. So long as man is set fast in deliber­
ate self-assertion and establishes himself by the absolute objectification in
departure against the open, he himself promotes his own defenselessness.
On the other hand, the risk that risks more fashions us a safebeing. Of
course this does not take place by erecting a sheltering defense around the
defenseless; for in that case a defense would be set up only in those places
where it was absent. For that purpose, production would again be required.
This is only possible in objectification, which, however, seals us off against
the open. The risk that risks more does not produce a defense. However,
it fashions us a safebcing. Safe, secU1·us, sine cum means: without care. Care
has here the nature of deliberate self-assertion along the ways and by the
means ofabsolute production. We are without this care only when we do not
set up our essence exclusively in the precinct of production and command,
of utilization and defense. We are safe only where we are neither taking
the defenseless into account nor counting on a defense erected in the will.

223

OFF Ti l E B EATE� TRACK

A safebeing exists only outside of the objectified turning away from the
open, only "outside of all defense," outside of the departure against the
pure attraction. This is the unheard center of all attracting that draws each
thing into the unbarriered and attracts each thing for the center. This center
is the "there" where the gravity of the pure forces takes effect. The safe being
is the sheltered repose in the attraction-nexus of the whole attraction.
The risk that risk.c; more, which wills more than each self-assertion be­
cause it is more willing, "fashions" us a safebeing in the open. Fashion [schaf­

fm]

means: create or retrieve

[schopfen]. To retrieve from a source means to

take in what rises up and to bring away what has been received. The more
risking risk of the willing will manufactures nothing. It receives and gives
what it has received. It brings away by realizing what it has received in
its fullness. The more risking risk brings to completion, but it does not
produce. Only a risk that risks more so long as it is willing can bring to
completion by receiving.
Lines 1 2- 1 6 encompass that which constitutes the more risking risk, the
risk which ventures into the outside of defense and brings us into a safe being
there. In no way docs this eliminate the defenselessness that is posed with
deliberate self-assertion. So long as the essence of man is engrossed into the
objectification of beings, it remains defenseless amidst beings. Undefended
in this way, man is of course, in the mode of deprivation, attracted to defense
and so inside of defense. Safebeing on the other hand is outside of every
relation to defense: "outside of all defense."
Accordingly it appears that safebeing and our attaining safebeing requires
a risk that abandons every relation to defense and defenselessness. However,
this only appears to be the case. In truth, when we think from the closure of
the whole attraction, we come at last to know that which in the end (that is,
in advance) relieves us of the care of undefended self-assertion (lines I z f.):
. . . what saves us at last

is our defenselessness . . .
How is defensele.'isness supposed to bring us to safety

[Geborgenheit]

[bergm] when only

and when defenselessness consists

in continuous departure against the open? Defenselessness can only save
when the turning away against the open is reversed, so that it is turned
toward the open - and turned into it. Therefore, defenselessness in reverse
is that which saves us. To bring to safety means here, on the one hand, that
it completes the reversal of departure and, on the other, that in a certain
way defenselessness itself affords safe being. What saves:

224

Wi l Y POETS?

is our defenselessness and that seeing it threaten
we turned it into the open . . .

The "and" leads into the explanation that tells

us

how this astonishing

thing is pos.c;ible, that our defenselessness outside of defense sends

us

a

safebeing. Certainly defenselessness never saves anything by our turning it
each time that it threatens in a particular case. Defenselessnes.o; saves only so
far as we have already turned it. Rilke says that "we turned it into the open."
In having turned it, there is a notable mode of reversal. In having turned it,
defenselessness is turned in advance as a whole in its essence. What is notable
about this turning is that we saw defenselessness as that which threatens us.
Only such having-seen sees the danger. It sees that defenselessness as such
threatens our essence with the loss of belonging in the open. Having-turned
must be rooted in this having-seen. Then defenselessness is turned "into
the open." Through having seen the danger as a danger to our essence, we
must have completed the reversal of the turning away against the open. This
implies: the open itself must have inclined itself toward us in a way that we
can turn defenselessness toward it:
in order, somewhere, in the wide.�t compass,

where law touche.� us, to say yes to it.

What is the widest compass? Presumably Rilke is thinking of the open and
moreover in a particular respect. The widest compass encircles everything
that is. To encompass is to unite around all beings, so that it is indeed, in the
union that unites, the being of beings. But what is it to be "being

[seiend]"?

The poet, it is true, calls beings in their entirety by the name "Nature," "life,"
"the open," "the whole attraction." Following the conventional language
of metaphysics, he even calls this round entirety of beings: "being." But
still, we do not experience which essence belongs to being. However, is
something not said about it when Rilke designates being the risk that risks
everything? Certainly. Accordingly we tried to think this designation back
into the modern essence of the being of beings, into the will to will. But
now this talk of the widest compass has nothing very clear to tell us when
we

try to think of it as the entirety of beings, and of encompassing as the

being of beings.
It is true that, when we think, we remember the fact that originally
the being of beings was already thought � th regard to the encompassing.
Nonetheless, our thinking about this sphericality of being is too facile and
will always be superficial unless we have already asked and experienced how

zzs

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

the being of beings originally essences. The

t6v, the being, of the E6VTa,

of beings in their entirety, is called the "Ev, the One that ones, the union
that unites. What, however, is this encircling union, as a fundamental trait
of being? What is being?

t6v, being, means: presencing, that is presenc­

ing precisely in the unhidden. In presencing, however, there is hidden the
displaying that comes from unhiddenness, which allows what is present to
essence as such. But what is actually present is just presencing itself, which
is everywhere the same in its own center and, as its own center, is the sphere.
The sphericality is not based on a circling which then surrounds, but rather
on the unconcealing center that in throwing light saves what is present. The
sphericality of the union and the union itself have the character of an un­
concealing illumination, within which what is prc.o;ent can presence. That is
why Pannenides calls the e6v, the presencing of what is present, the eVKVKAOS

acpaip11 (Fragment 8, line 43, in Diels, Fmp;mente

der

Vorsokratiker).

This

well-rounded globe should be thought as the being of beings in the sense
of the unconcealing-illuminating union. This union that unites everywhere
in this way permits

us

to call it the illuminating globe which does not em­

brace, but rather itself releases illuminatingly into presencing. We must
never represent the globe of being and the sphericality of the globe of be­
ing objectively. Therefore, non-objectively? No; that would be merely to
dodge behind a phrase. The sphericality must be thought in terms of the
essence of original being in the sense of unconcealing presencing.
Does Rilke's phrase about the widest compass mean this sphericality of
being? Not only do we not have a ground for such an interpretation, but
also his characterization of the being of beings as the risk (will) completely
goes against it. Nonetheless, Rilke himself at one point speaks of the "globe
of being," and he does this in a context that directly bears upon the interpre­
tation of this talk of the widest compass. He writes in a letter on Epiphany
Uanuary 6], 1 92 3 (cf.

lnsei-Ahnanach auf das Jahr, 19]8,

p. 109): " . . . like

the moon, so life surely has a side continually turned away from us, which
is not its opposite, but rather its complement toward perfection, toward
full measure, toward the real, whole, and full sphere and globe of being."
Although we must not press the figurative reference to heavenly bodies
that are presented objectively, it nonetheless remains clear that Rilke is not
thinking of sphericality from the perspective of being in the sense of the
illuminating-oneing presencing, but rather from the perspective of beings
in the sense of the full measure of all their sides. What Rilke calls here the
globe of being (that is, the globe of beings in their entirety) is the open as
the closure of the pure forces that overflow into each other without barrier

226

WHY POETS?

and so act toward each other. The widest compass is the entirety of the
whole attraction of attracting. To this widest circle there corresponds the
strongest center, "the unheard center" of pure gravity.
To tum defenselessness into the open means: "to say yes" to defenseless­
ness within the widest compass. Such an affinnation is possible only where
the entirety of the compass in every respect is not only in full measure but
also of equal measure, and so already lies before us and accordingly is the
positum. Only position and never negation can correspond to it. Even the
sides oflife that are turned away from us are to be taken positively, provided
they are in being. The letter of November 1 3 , 1 9 2 5, mentioned above, says:
"Death is the side oflife turned away from us, unlit by us" (Briefo nus Muzot,
p. 3 3 2). Death and the ldngdom of the dead belong, as the other side, to
the entirety of beings. This realm is "the other attraction," that is, the other
side of the whole attraction of the open. In the widest compass of the globe
of beings, there are such realms and places that, since they are turned away
from us, appear to be something negative, but they are nothing of the sort
if we think into the widest compass of beings.
Seen from the open, defenselessness too, as the departure against the pure
attraction, seems to be something negative. The departing self-assertion of
objectification everywhere intends the constancy of produced objects; it lets
only this constancy count as a being and as positive. The self-assertion of
technological objectification is the constant negation ofdeath. Through this
negation, death itselfbecomes something negative; it becomes the archetype
of the inconstant and the void. However, when we tum defenselessness into
the open, we tum it into the widest compass of beings, within which we can
only affirm defenselessness. Turning into the open is the refusal to read that
which is as negative. But what is more being, and therefore, as modems think
it, what is more certain than death? The letter cited above from january 6,
192 3, says that it is valid "to read the word 'death' without negation."
When we tum defenselessness as such into the open, we then reverse
it in its essence (i.e., as the departure against the whole attraction) into an
inclining toward the widest compass. It only remains to affirm what has
been reversed in this way. Yet this affirmation does not mean turning the no
into a yes, but rather to acknowledge the positive as that which already lies
before us and presences. This happens when we allow the defenselessness
that has been inverted to belong within the widest compass, "where law
touches us. " Rilke does not say: a law. He "therefore docs not mean a rule.
He is thinking of what "touches us." Who arc we? We are the ones who
will, who set up, in the mode of deliberate self-assertion, the world as object.

227

OFF Ti l E B EATEN TRACK

When we are touched from out of the widest compass, then this touching
concerns our essence. 'Io touch means: bring i nto motion. Our essence is
brought into motion.

In

stirring us, our will is shaken, so that only then

does the essence of will come to light and become set in motion. Only then
it is possible to will willingly.
Yet what is it that touches us directly from out of the widest compass?
What is it that, in the ordinary will to objectify the world, is obstructed
and withdrawn from us by us ourselves? It is the other attraction: death.
It is death that touches mortals in their essence and so places them on the
way to the other side of life and so into the entirety of the pure attrac­
tion. This is how death gathers into the entirety of what has already been

be accessible beforehand as the potential scope for reversal. However, what
brings us safcbeing, and with it the dimension of certainty in general, is that
risk which sometimes risks more than life itself does.
But this risk that risks more does not busy itself here and there about our
defenselessness. It docs not attempt to adjust this or that way of objectifying
the world. On the contrary it turns defenselessness as such. The risk that
risks more actually brings defenselessness into its own realm.
What is the essence of defenselessness, if it consists of objectifi­
cation which is based on deliberate self-assertion? The objectiveness
[ Gegenstiindige] of the world becomes

constant [stiindigJ

in representational

production. This representing makes a presentation. However, what is
present is present in a representation that has the nature of calculation. This
representing knows nothing of the immediately visible [Anschau/iches]. What
is immediately visible in things, the picture they offer to direct sensible intu­

[AnschauungJ, falls away. Calculating production is an "action without

constructions

[Gebi/de].

When the world enters into the objectiveness of

f.1ctitiou'i constructions, it is placed in the insensible, the invisible. This
constancy of objectiveness
whose activity belongs to

the res cogita11s, that is, to consciousness. The

sphere of the objectivity of objects remains within consciousness. The in­
visibility of objectiveness belongs to the inwardness of the immanence of
consciousness.
However, if defenselessness is departure against the open, and if depar­
ture nonetheless rests on the objectification that belongs to the invisibility
and inwardness of calculating consciousness, then the essential sphere of
defenselessness is the invisibility and inwardness of consciousness.
If, however, the inversion of defenselessness into the open concerns the
essence of defenselessness in advance, then the reversal of defenselessness is
a reversal of consciousness, or more precisely within the sphere of conscious­
ness. The sphere of the invisible and the inward determines the essence of
defenselessness, but it also determines the nature of the turning of defense­
lessness into the widest compass. Consequently, it can only be to the most
invisible invisibility and the most inward inwardness that the essentially
inward and invisible must

tum

itself in order to find what is actually it'l

In modem metaphysics, the sphere of the invisible inward is defined

as the realm of the presence of calculated objects. Descartes characterized
the sphere as the consciousness of the

ego cogito.

At about the same time as Descartes, Pascal discovered the logic of the
heart in contrast to the logic of calculating reason. The interior and the invis­
ible of the heart's space is not only more inward than the interior of calculat­
ing representation, and therefore more invisible, but at the same time it also
reaches further than the realm of objects that are merely produced. Only in
the invisible innermost of the heart does man tend toward that which is to be
loved: ancestors, the dead, childhood, those who are coming. These belong
in the widest compass, which proves now to be the sphere of the presence
of the whole integral attraction. Admittedly, this presence, like that of the
conventional consciousness of calculating production, is a presence of im­
manence. However, the interior of unwonted consciousness remains the in­
terior space in which everything, for us, is beyond the numbering [Zahlhafte]
of calculation and, freed from these barriers,

can

overflow into the unbarred

entirety of the open. This overflowing beyond number (iibet'Ziihlige) springs
up, with regard to it.c; presence, in the inward and invisible of the heart. The

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

The widest compass of beings becomes present in the inner space of the
heart. The entirety of the world attains here a presence in each of its at­
tractions that is essentially equal. Rilke calls this presence, in the language
of metaphysics, "existence"

[Dasein).

The whole presence of the world is

"worldly existence" in the largest sense. That is another name for the open;
this other name comes from thinking the open itself out from the imma­
nence of the calculating consciousness and into the inner space of the heart,
which means that the representing-producing turning away against the open
has been reversed. The heartful inner space for worldly existence is there­
fore also called the "world inner space." "Worldly" means the entirety of
beings.
Rilke writes in a letter from Muzot on August I I , I 924:
As extended as the "outside" is, with all its sidereal dimensions it hardly bears com­
parison

with the depth dimensiun of our inwardness

which does not even need the

spaciousness of the universe to be in it.'i elf almost immeasurable. So if the dead, if
the future ones, need a residence,

what refuge would

be more pleasant and more

proffered to them than this imaginary space? It increasingly appears to me as though
our customary consciousnes.'i inhabits the apex of a pyramid whose base in us (and
in a certain sense beneath us) extends to so great a breadth that the more competent
we find ourselves to descend into it, the more generally we seem involved in the
facts of earthly, of wurldly (in the widest sense) existence, facts independent of time
and space.

However, the objectiveness of the world is still to be calculated in repre­
sentation which treats time and space as quanta for calculation and can know
as little of the essence of time as of the essence of space. Even Rilke fails to
consider the spatiality of the world's inner space further, nor does he even
begin to ask whether world inner space, since after all it provides an abode
for worldly presence, is grounded by this presence in a temporality whose
essential time together with essential space forms the originary oneness of
that time-space by which even being itself essences.
However, what Rilke is trying to do, within the sphericality of modem
metaphysics (i.e., within the sphere of subjectivity as the sphere of inward
and invisible presence), is to understand the defenselessness posed by the
self-asserting essence of man in such a way that the defenselessness itself,
reversed, saves us in the innermost and most invisible region of the widest
inner space of the world. Defenselessness as such brings us to safety. For
as the inward and invisible, it gives to its essence the sign for a reversal of
the turning away against the open. The reversal points into the inward of
the interior. The reversal of consciousness is therefore a memory of the

2 30

Wi lY POETS?

immanence of the objects of representation, a making inward into presence
within the heart's space.
As long as man is exclusively absorbed in deliberate self-assertion, it is not
only he himself that is defenseless, but also things since they have become
objects. In this, it is true, there is another transformation of things into the
inward and invisible. However, this transformation substitutes for the frailty
of things the factitious constructions of calculated objects. These objects
are produced for consumption. The more quickly they arc consumed, the
more necessary it becomes to replace them ever more quickly and easily.
That which is enduring about the presence of objective things is not their
resting-in-themselves in their own world. What is constant about things
produced as mere objects of consumption is the substitute [Rrsatz].
Just as the waning and disappearance of familiar things within the
supremacy of objectivity is part of our defenselessness, so the safebeing
of our essence demands that things be saved from mere objectivity. The
salvation of things consists in their being able to rest in themselves within
the widest compass of the whole attraction, that is, to rest unrestrictedly in
each other. Perhaps the turning ofour defenselessness into worldly existence
within world inner space actually has to commence with our turning the frail
and therefore provisional quality of objective things from out of the inward­
ness and invisibility of merely productive consciousness and into the actual
interior of the heart's space and our permitting it to rise up there invisibly.
Accordingly the letter of November 1 3 , 1 9 2 5 says (B1'iej'e aus Muzot, p. 3 3 5):
. . . our task is this, to imprint this provisional, frail earth so deeply, so sufferingly
and passionately that its essence rises up again within us "invisibly." We are the bees
of the invisible. Nous butinons cpcrdument le mid du visible, pour accumuler dans
Ia grande ruche d'or de )'Invisible. [We gather constantly the honey of the visible
in order to preserve it in the great golden hive of the Invisible.]

Memory, making inward, inverts our essence that only wills assertively,
and its objects, into the innermost invisibility of the heart's space. Here
everything is inwardly then: not only does everything remain turned toward
this actual interior of consciousness, but also within this interior one thing
turns itself for us into another without restriction. The inwardliness ofworld
inner space unbars the open for us. Only what we inwardly keep (pm· CfE'U1')
in this manner do we really know by heart. In this inwardliness we are free,
outside of the relationship to ohjects that only appear to protect us and that
are placed around us. In the inwardliness of world inner space there is a
safebeing outside of all defense.
231

OFF TI I E BEATE� TRACK

Yet the question we have been asking all along is how can this memory,
this making inward, of the already-immanent objectiveness ofconsciousness
happen in the innermost of the heart? It is a matter of the inward and
the invisible. For what is remembered (made inward) as well as where it
is remembered (made inward) are of such an essence. Memory, making
inward, reverses departure into the arrival into the widest compass of the
open. Who among mortals is capable of this reversing memory, this making
inward that reverses?
Admittedly, the poem says that a safebeing of our essence would be
brought to us by the fact that men "sometimes even risk more . . . than life
itself does, by a breath risk more."
What do they risk, those who risk more? The poem, it appears, is silent
about the answer. We will therefore try to accommodate the poem thought­
fully and draw on other poems for help.
We ask the question: what else could be risked, what would risk more
than life itself, that is, more than the risk itself, that is, risk more than the
being of beings? In each case and in every respect what is risked must be of
such a kind that it affects all beings because they are beings. Being is of such
a kind; that is, it is not one particular kind among others, but the mode of
beings as such.
If being is the uniqueness of a being, how is it possible to go beyond
being? Only through being itself, only through what is its own, or rather
in such a way that it comes specifically into its own. Then being would
be the uniqueness that preeminently goes beyond itself (the transcrndens par
excellence). However, this surpassing does not go up and over unto another,
but rather it comes over unto itself and back into the essence of its truth.
Being itself traverses this passage and is itself its dimension.
Thinking this, we find by experience that within being itself there is a
"more" belonging to it and so we find the possibility that there too, where
being is thought as the risk, that which risks more than even being itself
can prevail, if we are representing being as we usually do, on the basis of
beings. Being traverses, as itself, its precinct [Bezirk] which is demarcated
[bezirkt] (TEIJVEIV, tempus) by the fact that it essences in the word. Language
is the precinct (templum), i.e., the house of being. The essence of language
is neither exhausted in reference, nor is it only a matter of signs and ciphers.
Since language is the house of being, we therefore arrive at beings by con­
stantly going through this house. If we go to the fountain, if we go through
the woods, we are already going through the word "fountain," through the
word "wood," even if we are not saying these words aloud or have any

232

WHY POETS?

thoughts about language. By thinking in terms of the temple of being, we
can imagine what it is they risk, the ones who risk more than the being of
beings. They risk the precinct of being. They risk language. All beings, the
objects of consciousness and the things of the heart, the self-asserting men
and the men who risk more, all creatures, each in its own way, are (as beings)
in the precinct of language. That is why

only in this precinct,

if anywhere,

can the reversal from the region of objects and their representation into the
innermost of the heart's space be realized.
For Rilke's poetry, the being of beings is determined metaphysically as
worldly presence, a presence which remains attracted to representation in
consciousness, whether this has the character of the immanence of calculat­
ing representation or that of inwardly turning to the open made accessible
by the heart.
The entire sphere of presence is present in saying. The objectiveness of
production is found in the expression of calculating propositions and theo­
rems of reason that proceed from proposition to proposition. The realm of
self-assertive defenselessness is dominated by reason. Not only has reason
set up a special system of rules for its saying, for the

i\6yos as explanatory

predicates, but also the logic of reason itself organizes the domination of
deliberate self-assertion within the objective. In the reversal of objective
representation, the logic of the heart corresponds to the saying of mem­
ory. In both realms, which arc metaphysically determined, logic prevails
because memory, making inward, is to fashion a safebeing from defense­
lessness itself and outside of all defense. This bringing to safety concerns
man as the creature that has language. Within being that has been stamped
metaphysically, this is how man has
and only as a possession

(Habe]

[hat]

language: he takes it in advance

and thus as a handle

sentation and behavior. That is why the

(1/andhnbe] for repre­

i\6yos, saying as organon, is in need

of organization by logic. Only within metaphysics is there logic.
Now when, however, at the fashioning of safebeing man is touched by
the law of the entire world inner space, he is himself touched in his essence
by the fact that he, as the one who wills himself, is the one who is already
saying. Nonetheless, in that the fashioning of a safebeing comes from the
ones who risk more, they must risk it with language. The ones who risk
more are the ones who risk saying. Yet if this precinct of risking, language,
belongs to being in the unique way that beyond and outside it nothing else
of it'i nature can exist, where is that which is supposed to be said spoken
by those who must say? Their saying concerns the remembering (making
inward) reversal of consciousness which turns our defenselessness into the

233

O FF THE BF.ATE:-.1 TRACK

invisibility of world inner space. Because it concerns the reversal, their say­
ing speaks not only from both realms but also from the oneness of both,
if the reversal has already taken place as the saving union. For this reason,
when the entirety of beings is thought as the open of the pure attraction,
the remembering reversal must be a saying that says what it has to say to
a creature already secure in the entirety of beings because it has already
carried out the transformation of represented visibility into the invisibil­
ity of the heart. This creature is included in the pure attraction by both
sides of the globe of being. This creature, for whom limits and differences
among attractions hardly exist any longer, is the creature who manages the
unheard center of the widest compass and lets it appear. This creature, in
Rilke's

Duino Elegies, is the angel. This name is another fundamental word

of Rilke's poetry. It, like "the open," "the attraction," "departure," "nature,"
is a fundamental word because what is said in it thinks the entirety of beings
in terms of being. In the letter of November 1 3 , 192;

(Brieft aus Muzot,

p. 3 3 7), Rilke writes:
The angel of the Elegies is that creature in whom the transformation of the visible
into the invisible, which we are achieving, is already accomplished . . . The angel of
the elegies is that being who affirms the recognition of a higher rank of reality in
the invisible.

The extent to which, within the fulfillment of modern metaphysics, the
attraction to such a creature is part of the being of beings, the extent
to which the essence of the Rilkean angel is

metaphysically the same,

with

all their differences in content, as the Nietz..'>chean figure of Zarathustra,
can only be shown from a more originary unfolding of the essence of
subjectivity.
The poem thinks the being of beings, Nature, as the risk. All beings are
risked into the risk. As that which is risked, they lie upon the balance. The
balance is the way that being always weighs beings, i.e., holds them in the
movement of swaying. Everything that is risked is in danger. The realms
of beings are differentiated according to the nature of their relationship to
the balance. The essence of the angel must also be clarified with respect to
the balance, assunung the angel occupies the higher rank in the entire realm
of beings.
Plant and animal, in "the risk of their dull desire," are held free from
care in the open. Their physicality does not confuse them. Living beings
are lulled into the open by their drives. Indeed, they too are threatened, hut
not in their essence. Plant and animal lie upon the balance in such a way

2 34

WHY POETS?

that the balance always plays out in the calm of a safebeing. The balance
into which plant and animal arc risked docs not yet reach into the realm
of the essentially and therefore constantly uncalmed. The balance upon
which the angel is risked also remains outside the uncalmed; not, however,
because the balance does not yet belong in the realm of the uncalmed, but
because it no longer belongs there. In accordance with the angel's incor­
poreal essence, potential confusion through what is visible to the angel's
senses has been transformed into the invisible. The angel essences from the
calmed quiet of the equilibrated oneness of both realms within world inner
space.
Man, on the other hand, as one who deliberately asserts himself, is risked
into defenselessness. The scales of danger are essentially uncalmed in the
hand of the man who has been so risked. The self-willing man always calcu­
lates with things and people as he does with objects. That with which he has
calculated turns into merchandise. Everything is constantly changed into
new orderings. Departure against the pure attraction is established in the
unquiet of the constantly swaying balance. Departure, in the objectifica­
tion of the world, against its own intention, pursues the inconstant. Risked
into defenselessness in this way,

man

moves in the medium of businesses

and "exchanges." Self-asserting man lives by his will's stakes. He lives es­
sentially in the hazard of his essence within the vibration of money and
the validity of values. Man, as this constant exchanger and middleman, is
"the merchant." He weighs and evaluates constantly and yet does not know
the actual weight of things. Nor does he ever lrnow what, in him, actually has
weight and outweighs. This is what Rilke says in one of the

Spiite Gedichte

(pp. 2 r ff.):
Alas, who knows what weighs the most in him.
Mildness? Terror? Glances, voices, books?
Ach wer kennt, was in ihm iiberwiegt.
Mildheit? Schrecken? Blicke, Stimmen, Bucher?

However, man outside of all defense can at the same time fashion a
"safebeing" by turning his defenselessness as such into the open and trans­
fanning it into the heart's space of the invisible. Once this happens, the
uncalm of defenselessness passes over to where, in the equilibrated oneness
of world inner space, the creature appears who brings to light the way in
which oneness unites and who in that way represents being. The scales of
danger then pass from the realm of the calculating will over to the angel.
Four lines are preserved from Rilke's late period which evidently constitute

235

OFF TH E B EATDI TRACK

the beginning of a draft of a larger poem. They run (Gesammelte Werke, vol.
m, P· 4JS):
When from the merchant's hand
the balance passes over
to that angel who in the heavens
calms and soothes it with the equilibrium of space . . .
Wenn aus des Kaufmanns Hand
Die Wage iibcrgeht
an jenen Engel, der sie in den Hirnrneln
stillt und beschwichtigt mit des Raurnes Ausgleich . . .

The equilibrating space is the world inner space in that it makes space
for the worldly entirety of the open. In this way it grants both to the one and
to the other attraction the appearance of their uniting union. This union,
as the integral globe of being, encompasses all the pure forces of beings by
circulating through all creatures, in-finitely unbarring them. Such things
become present when the balance passes over. When does it pass over? Who
lcto; the balance pass from the merchant over to the angel? If such a passing
happens at all, then it occurs in the precinct of the balance. The element of
the scales is the risk, the being of beings. We have been thinking language
specifically as the precinct of being.
The usual life of today's man is the ordinariness of self-assertion in the
defenseless market of exchangers. In contrast, to pass the balance over to
the angel is unusual. It is even unusual not only because it constitutes the
exception within the rule but also because it takes man with regard to his
essence into the outside of the rule of defense and defenselessness. This
is the reason that passing over happens "sometimes." In no way does that
mean here: from time to time or as you like; "sometimes" means rarely and
at the right time in each single case in its singular way. Passing the balance
over from the merchant to the angel, i.e., the reversal of departure, happens
as the remembering (the making inward) into world inner space at the time
when there are such men who "sometimes risk more . . . by a breath risk
more."
Because those who risk more risk it with being itself and therefore risk
themselves into language, the precinct of being, they are the ones who say.
But is not man, then, the one who has language by his essence and constantly
risks his essence with language? Certainly. Then the one who wills in the
usual way also already risks saying in calculating production. Of course.
Then, however, those who risk more cannot be those who merely say. The

WHY POETS?

saying [Sagen] of those who risk more must specifically risk what is said
[Sage]. Those who risk more are only who they are when they are the ones
who say more.
'When, in our representing and producing relationship [ Verhiiltnis] to
beings, we conduct ourselves [s. verba/ten] by making statements, then such
saying is not what is being willed. Making statements remains a way and
a means. In contrast, there is a saying that is specially engaged with what
is said without, however, reflecting on language and thereby turning it too
into an object. To enter into what is said characterizes a saying that pursues
what is to be said solely in order to say it. 'What is to be said would then
be that which, in accordance with its essence, belongs in the precinct of
language. That, in metaphysical thinking, would be beings in their entirety.
Their entirety is the unbrokenness of the pure attraction, the wholeness of
the open, in that it grants man space. This happens in world inner space.
This space touches man when, within the reversing inward memory, he turns
himself [s. zuwendet] to the heart's space. Those who risk more tum [wenden]
the unwholeness of defenselessness into the wholeness of worldly existence.
This is what is to be said. In the saying there is a tum [s. wendet] toward men.
Those who risk more are the ones who say more in the manner ofthe singer.
Their singing is stolen [mtwenden] from all deliberate self-assertion. It is
not a willing in the sense of coveting. Their song does not solicit [bewirbt]
something to be produced. In song it is world inner space itself that grants
space. The song of this singer is not an advertisement [WerbenJ and not a
business [Gewerbe].
The saying that says more, by those who risk more, is song. However,
"Song is existence"
"Gesang ist Dasein"

is what the third sonnet says in the first part of the Sonnets to Orpheus.
The word "existence" is here in the traditional sense of presence and is
synonymous with being. To sing, to say specifically worldly existence, to
say it from the wholeness of the whole pure attraction and only this, that
means: to belong in the precinct of beings themselves. As the essence of
language, this precinct is being itself. To sing song, means: to be present in
presencing itself; it means: existence.
Yet since only those who risk more are capable of it, the saying that
says more is only occasional. For it remains difficult. 'What is difficult is to
accomplish existence. 'What is difficult is not only the difficulty of making
a work of the language, but also to pass from the saying work of the vision

still covetous of things, from the work of the visage to the "heart's work. " • 3
Song i s difficult when the singing may no longer b e solicitation hut must
be existence. For the god Orpheus, who abides endlessly in the open, song
is ca!>)', but not for man. That is why the second stanza of that sonnet
asks:
But when
Wann

are we?
aber sind wir?

The stress is on the "arc," not on the "we." There is no question that
we belong among beings and are present in this respect. However, there
is still the question of when we are in such a way that our being is song.
And not just song whose singing resounds indiscriminately; but song that
is truly a singing, song whose sound is not attached to something to be
attained in the end but instead is shattered even in the sounding, so that
only the very thing that is sung comes to presence. Thus men say more
when they risk more than beings themselves are. Those who risk more,
according to the poem, "by a breath risk more." The sonnet we have cited
concludes:
To sing in truth is another hreath.

A breath for nothing. A blowing in God. A wind.
In Wahrheit singen, ist ein andrer l lauch.

Ein Hauch wn nichts. Ein Wehn im Gott. Ein Wind.

Herder writes in his Rejlecti011s on

the Philosophy ofthe History ofMankind

(Siimtliche Werke, ed. Suphan, vol. XITI, p. 355):
A breath of our mouth is the picture of the world, the type of our thoughts and
feelings in the soul of another. Every human thing that man has ever thought,
willed, done, and will do upon earth has depended on the movement of a bit of air;
for we would all still be wanderers in the woods if this divine breath had not inspired
us and hovered on our lips like a charm.

The breath by which those who risk more risk more does not only or
primarily mean the hardly noticeable (because fleeting) measure of a dif­
ference; rather, it signifies directly the word and the cs.'ience of language.
The one.'i who by a breath risk more risk it with language. They are the
saying ones who are saying more. For this one breath by which they risk
more is not just saying in general; rather, the one breath is an other breath, a
saying other than what human saying usually is. The other breath no longer
solicits for this or that objective thing; it is a breath for nothing. The saying

WHY POETS?

of the singer says the integral entirety of worldly existence that grants its
space invisibly in the world inner space of the heart. Song does not even
pursue first what is to be said. Song is the belonging in the entirety of the
pure attraction. 'lb sing is drawn

[gezogm]

from the draft

[Zug] of the wind

of the unheard center of full Nature. Song is itself: "A wind."
So, then, the poem in its poetry does after all unambiguously say who
they are who risk more than life itself does. They are the ones who "by

a

breath risk more." There is a point to the ellipsis that follows in the text of
the poem after "by a breath risk more." It says what is silently withheld.
Those who risk more are the poets, but poets whose song turns our de­
fenselessness into the open. Because they reverse the departure against the
open and inwardly remember its unwholeness

[Heil-loses]

into the integral

[heile] whole, these poets sing the integral in disintegration [im Unheilen
das Heile]. The remembering reversal that is made inward has already over­
taken the turning away against the open. It is "ahead of all departure"'4 and
surmounts, in the world inner space of the heart, everything objective. The
reversing inward remembrance is the risk that is dared out of the essence
of man in that he has language and is the one that says.
Modem man, however, is called the one who wills. The ones who risk
more are the ones who will more, in that they will in another mode than the
deliberative self-assertion of the objectification of the world. Their willing
wills nothing of this nature. If will remains only self-assertion, they will
nothing. They will nothing in this sense because they are more willing.
They comply rather with the will which, as the risk itself, draws all the
pure forces unto itself as the pure whole attraction of the open. The willing
of those who risk more is the willingness of those who say more, who arc
resolute

[ent-schlossen], no longer shut (venchlossen]

in departure against the

will by which being wills beings. The willing essence of those who risk more
says more sayingly (in the words of the Ninth

Elegy):

Earth, isn't it this your will: invisibly
to rise within us? - Isn't it your dream
to he invisible one day? - Earth! invisible!
\Vhat, if not transfonnation, is your urgent mission?
Earth, dear one, I will.
Erde, ist cs nicht dies, was du willst: unsichtbar

In the invisibility ofworld inner space, as the unity ofwhich the angel ap­
pears, the wholeness of worldly beings becomes evident. Only in the widest
compass of the whole is the holy able to appear. Because they experience
unwholeness as such, poets of the kind who risk more are underway on the
track of the holy. Their song sanctifies over the land. Their song celebrates
the unbrokenness of the globe of being.
The unwhole, as the unwhole, traces for us what is whole. What is whole
beckons and calls to the holy. The holy binds the divine. The divine brings
God closer.
Those who risk more experience defenselessness in unwholeness. They
bring mortals the track of the fugitive gods in the darkness of the world's
night. Those who risk more, as singers of what is whole, are "poets in a
desolate time."
The distinctive mark of these poets consists in the fact that for them the
essence of poetry has become worth questioning, since they are poetically
on the track of that which, for them, is to be said. On the track to what is
whole, Rilke arrives at the poetical question: when may song be that sings
essentially? This question does not stand at the beginning of the poetic path,
but rather at the point where Rilke's saying arrives at the poetic vocation of
the poetry that answers to the coming world-era. This era is neither decay
nor decline. As destiny it lies in being and lays claim to man.
Holderlin is the forerunner of the poets in a desolate time. That is why
no poet of this era can overtake him. The forerunner, however, does not go
away into a future, rather he arrives from it in such a way that in the ad­
vent [Ankrmft] of his words alone the future [Zukunft] presences. The more
purely the advent takes place, the more essentially, the more essenced, it re­
mains. The more what is coming is secretly conserved in the foretelling, the
purer the arrival. That is why it would be erroneous to say that Holderlin's
time would come only when "everyone" understands his poetry. It will never
come in such a deformed way. Its own desolation is what puts at the disposal
of the era the forces by which, knowing not what it is doing, the era prevents
Holderlin's poetry from becoming timely.
The forerunner [Vorgiinger] can as little be overtaken as he can pass away
[vergiinglich irt], for his poetry remains as something that has been in an
essential way [Ge-wesenes]. What essences [das Wesende] in the advent gathers
itself back into destiny. What does not fall into the course of passing away
[Vergehen] overcomes at the start all that is transient [ VergiinglichkeitJ. What
has merely passed away is already, in advance of its passing away, without
destiny. What has been in an essential way, by contrast, is the destining. In

WHY POETS?

what we suppose is eternity, something merely transitory [ Ve7Kangliches] has
been concealed, put away into the void of a now without duration.
If Rilke is a "poet in a desolate time," then only his poetry will answer
the question why he is a poet, what it is his song is underway to, where the
poet belongs in the destiny of the world's night. This destiny will decide the
question of what within his poetry remains destining.

Anaximander's Saying

It is considered to be the oldest saying of Western thinking. Anaximander
is said to have lived on the island of Samos from the end of the seventh
century until the middle of the sixth.
According to the generally accepted text the fragment reads:
E� wv 6� 1i ytveals EO'TI Tois oval Kal -rl}v cpBopav els TaVTa yiveaBal KaTCx TO
xpewv· 6!66val yap a\rra SIKT\V Kal TIO'IV CxAATJAOIS Ti'\S a61Kias KaTcl -rl}v TOV

XPOVOU TQ�IV.
Whence things have their coming into being there they must also perish according
to necessity; for they must pay a penalty and he judged for their injustice, according
to the ordinance of time.

Thus the youthful Nietzsche's translation in his treatise of 1 873 entitled
"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks." This treatise was first pub­
lished posthumously in 1903, thirty years after its composition. It is based
on a lecture course Nietzsche had given several times in Basle in the early
1 87os under the title "The Pre-Platonic Philosophers with Interpretation
of Selected Fragments."
In the same year, 1 903, in which Nietzsche's treatise first became
publicly available, Hermann Diets' Pre-SoCTlltic Fragments [Fmgmente der
Vonokratiker] appeared. It contained texts critically established according
to the methods of modem classical philology, together with a translation.
The work is dedicated to Wilhelm Dilthey. Diels translates Anaximander's
saying as follows:
But where things derive their coming into being, there their passing away also
occurs according to necessity; for they pay each other punishment and penalty for
their dastardliness according to firmly established time.

Al':AXJMA:\IDER'S SAYI!':G

The translations ofNietzsche and Diels arise from different impulses and
intentions. Nonetheless they are hardly distinguishable. Diels' translation
is in many respects the more literal. But if a translation is merely literal it
cannot be assumed to be faithful. It only becomes faithful when its words
are words that speak out of the language of the matter.
More important than the general agreement of the two translations is the
conception of Anaximander which underlies them. Nietzsche takes him to
belong to the pre-Platonics, Diels to the pre-Socratics. Both designations
say the same. The implicit standard for explicating and judging the early
thinkers is the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. Both are taken as the
philosophers of the Greeks who set the standard both before and after
themselves. This perception, via Christian theology, has established itself as
a general conviction that, to this very day, remains unshaken. Even where,
in the meantime, philological and historical research has occupied itself
more thoroughly with the philosophers before Plato and Aristotle, their
interpretation is still guided by modern versions of Platonic and Aristotelian
representations and concepts. This is even the case where one seeks to
discover the archaic in early thinking by looking for parallels in classical
archeology and literary history. lt remains within classical and classicistic
representations. One speaks of archaic logic heedless of the fact that such
a thing as logic exists for the first time within the Platonic and Aristotelian
curriculwn.
Merely ignoring later representations leads nowhere unless we, first of
all, look to how it stands with the matter which, in the translation from
one language to another, is to be translated. The matter here, however,
is the matter of thought. Granted that in translation we must take every
care to attend to the philologically clarified language, first and foremost,
nonetheless, we must think about the matter itself. Hence only the thinkers
can help us in the attempt to translate the saying of this early thinker. When,
however, we cast about for such help we search in vain.
The young Nietzsche does indeed, in his own way, establish a lively rela­
tionship to the personality of the pre-Platonic philosophers, but his inter­
pretation of the texts are thoroughly commonplace, even quite superficial.
The only Western thinker who has thoughtfully experienced the history
of thought is Hegel. Yet even he has nothing to say about Anaximander's
saying. Moreover, Hegel, too, shares the prevalent conviction concerning
the classical character of Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy. He endorses
the view which classifies the early thinkers as the "pre-Platonics" and "pre­
Socratics" precisely through grasping them as the "pre-Aristotelians."

2 43

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

In his lectures on the

history of Greek philosophy, at the point where he
comes to speak about the sources for our knowledge of the oldest epoch of
philosophy, Hegel says the following:
Aristotle is the richest source. He made a thorough study of, in particular, the oldest
philosophers. At the beginning of his Metaphysics {hut in many other places too}
he speaks of them in a systematically historical way. He is as philosophical as he is
scholarly; we can rely on him. For Greek philosophy we can do nothing better than
get to work on the first book of his Metaphysics.
(Werke, vol. Xlll, p. 1 89)

What Hegel recommends, here, to his listeners in the first decades of the
nineteenth century was practiced, in Aristotle's own time, by Theophrastus,
his pupil and immediate successor as leader of the Peripatetics. Theophras­
tus died in z86 BC. He composed a text with the title <J>vaiKwv 66�a1,
"The Opinions of Those Who Speak of cpvae1 oVTa." Aristotle also calls
them the cpva•oMyo•, meaning the early thinkers who discuss the things
of nature. <J>va•s means sky and earth, plants and animals, and in a certain
sense, human beings as well. The word designates a special region of beings
which, in Aristotle and in the School of Plato in general, is separated from
i'j6os and Myos. For them <l>Va•s no longer has the wider meaning of the
totality of beings. From the beginning of Aristotle's thematic observations
in the Physics, the kind of being called cpvae1 oVTa is contrasted with that of
TEXVIJ oVTa. The former is that which brings itself forth by arising out of
itself, the latter is that which is brought forth through human planning and
production.
Hegel's remark that Aristotle is as philosophical as he is scholarly means
the following: that Aristotle sees the early thinkers from the historical
perspective of his Physics. For us this means that Hegel understood the
pre-Platonic and pre-Socratic philosophers as the pre-Aristotelians. After
Hegel, two positions within the general view of philosophy before Aristotle
and Plato became firmly established. (1) In their search for the first origins
of beings the early thinkers, first and foremost, took nature alone as the
object of their reflections. (z) Their pronouncements on nature are inade­
quate approximations compared with the knowledge of nature which later
unfolded in the Platonic and Aristotelian schools, and with the Stoics and
in the schools of medicine.
The <J>uaJKwv 56�a• of Theophrastus became the chief source for
textbooks on the history of philosophy during the age of Hellenism. These
textbooks determined the interpretation of those of the early thinkers'

ANAXIMA:'IJDER'S SAYI:-.IG

original texts that still survived. Out of them, too, grew the subsequent
doxographical tradition in philosophy. Not just the content but also the
style of this tradition formed the relationship oflater thinkers to the history
of thought - up to Hegel and beyond.
In about AD 5 1 o, the neo-Platonist, Simplicius, wrote a comprehensive
commentary on Aristotle's Physics. In it he reproduces the text of Anaxi­
mander's saying, thereby preserving it for the West. He took it over from
Theophrastus' <l>va1Kc';'>V 56�al. From the time that Anaximander uttered
his saying - we do not know where, or how, or to whom - until the time
Simplicius inscribed it in his commentary, more than a thousand years had
elapsed. Between the time of his inscription and the present lies another
millennium and a half.
Can the saying of Anaximandcr, from the historical distance, chronolog­
ically reckoned, of two and a half thousand years still speak to us? From
what authority should it speak? Only the authority of being the oldest?
In themselves, the ancient and the antiquarian carry no weight. Besides,
though the saying is indeed the oldest preserved in our tradition, we do not
know whether it is the earliest saying of its kind in Western thought. We
may surmise this provided we first think the essence of the West from out
of that of which the early saying speaks.
But by what right does the early address us, presumably the latest of
the latecomers to philosophy? Are we the latecomers of a history that now
speeds toward its end, an end in which everything terminates in an ever more
desolate ordering of uniformity? Or is there, concealed in the chronolog­
ical remoteness of the saying, a historical proximity to the unspoken, an
unspoken that will speak out in that which is coming?
Do we stand in the very twilight of the most monstrous transformation
of the whole earth and of the time of the historical space in which it is sus­
pended? Do we stand before the evening of the night of another dawn? Arc
we setting forth on a journey into the historical land of the earth's evening?
Is the Land of the Evening1 only now emerging? Will this Evening-Land,
rising above Occident and Orient and transcending the European, become
the place of the coming, more primordially destined, history? Are we men
of today already "Western" in a sense that first arises out of our passage
into the world's night? What arc merely historiographically constructed
philosophies of history supposed to tell us about history if they only dazzle
us with a review of the material they adduce; if they explain history without
ever thinking the foundations of the principles of explanation out of the
essence of history, and this from out of being itself? Are we the latecomers
2 45

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK

who we are? Yet are we also the forerunners of the dawn of an altogether
different age which has left behind today's historiographical representations
of history?
Nietzsche (from whose philosophy, all too crudely understood, Spengler
calculated the demise of the West in the sense of the historical world) wrote
in his

The Wanderet· and His Shaduw, which

appeared in

1

88o:

An exalted condition of humanity is possible, one in which the Europe of nations
will be lost in dark forgetfulness, but in which Europe will live on in thiny very old,
hut never antiquated, books.
(Aphorism 1 2 5)

All historiography calculates what is to come from its images of the past,
images which are detennined by the present. Historiography is the con­
tinual destruction of the future and our historical relation to the advent of
destiny. I Iistoricism today has not only not been overcome, but is entering
only now the stage of its expansion and establishment. The technical or­
ganization of the public image of the world by radio and the press (which
is already struggling to keep up) is the authentic form of the dominion of
historicism.
Can we, however, represent and portray the dawn of an epoch in ways
other than those of historiography? Perhaps it is for

us

the indispensable

method of bringing the historical into the present. That in no way means,
however, that historiography, taken in itself, enables us to form a relation
that is adequate to reach to the historical within our history.
The antiquity which conditions Anaximander's saying belongs to the
dawn of the dawn of the Land of the Evening. What if, however, that very
first dawn overtook the latest, overtook it, indeed, by the greatest distance?
The "once" of the dawn of destiny would then come as the "once" of the

We d o not, however, understand the word "eschatology" i n the phrase
"eschatology of being" as the title of a theological or philosophical dis­
cipline. We think of the eschatology of being in the sense in which the
phenomenology of Spirit is to he thought, i.e., from within the history of
being. This phenomenology itself represents a phase in the eschatology of
being in as much as being gathers itself, in the extremity of its hitherto metaphysically determined - essence, as the absolute subjectivity of the wiH
to will.
If we are to think from out of the eschatology of being we must one day
await the "once" of the dawn in the "once" of what is approaching and must
today learn to ponder this "once" from out of this approach.
If we can manage, just once, to hear the saying it will speak to us
no longer as a historically remote opinion. If that happened, then we
would not be misled into the vain attempt to reckon historically, that
is, psycho-philologically, what was really present in the past, in the man
called Anaximander of Miletus, as the condition of his representation of
the world. \Vhat, however, presuming we have for once heard what is said
in the saying, binds us in our attempt to translate it? How do we arrive
at what is said in the saying so that it will preserve our translation from
arbitrariness?
We are bound to the language of the saying and we are bound to our
own native language. In both respects we are essentially bound to language
and to the experience of its essence. This bond is stronger and further­
reaching, although less conspicuous, than the standard provided by all the
philological and historical facts - which only derive their factuality from it.

As long as we fail to experience this bond, every translation of the saying
must come to light as something completely arbitrary. Yet even when we
are bound through that which is said in the saying, not just the translation
but the bond, too, retains the appearance of violence. It is as if that which
is to be heard is compelled to suffer violence.
Only through a dialogue between thought and what this thoughtful say­
ing says can it be translated. The thinking is, however, poeticizing - though
not in the sense of poesy or song. The thinking of being is the primordial
form of poeticizing in which, before everything else, language first becomes
language, enters, that is to say, its essence. Thinking says what the truth of
being dictates. a Thinking is the ur-poetry which precedes all poesy. But it
•

First Edition, 1 950. That is to say, thinking is saying which releases [Ent-sagmJ, the saying
of the Event.

2 47

OFF THE BEATE::-.1 TRACK

precedes, too, the poetic in art insofar as art's becoming an artwork hap­
pens within the realm of language. All poeticizing, in both this broader
and narrower sense of the poetic is, at bottom, thinking. The poeticizing
essence of thought preserves the sway of the truth of being. Because it poet­
icizes thoughtfully, the translation which wishes to allow the oldest saying
of thinking to speak necessarily appears violent.
We shall try to translate Anaximander's saying. This requires that we
bring hither (herii/Jmetzen] into our Gemtan language what is said in the
Greek. To this end it is necessary that, before the translating, our thinking
is translated [iibn:retzt] into what is said in Greek. lo make this thoughtful
translation to what comes to language in the saying is to leap over a gulf.
This by no means consists merely in the chronological-historical distance
of two and a half millennia. The gulf is wider and deeper. To leap over it is
hard, above all because we stand right on its edge. We are so close to the
gulf that we do not have a run up that is adequate for the take off and for
the breadth of the leap. It is easy, therefore, to fall short - if, indeed, that
lack of a sufficiendy solid basis allows any take off at all.
What comes to language in the saying? The question is still ambiguous
and therefore imprecise. It might ask for that about which the saying says
something. It might also mean that which is said itself.
More literally translated, the saying runs:
But that from which things have their arising also gives rise to their passing away
according to necessity; they give justice and pay penalty to each other for the injustice
according to the ordinance of time.

The usual view is that the sentence speaks about the arising and decay of
things. It specifies the nature of this process. Arising and decay return to the
place from where they came. Things develop and then they decay, exhibit­
ing thereby a kind of barter system in nature's unchanging economy. The
exchange between the constructive and destructive processes is, admittedly,
established onJy roughly as a general characteristic of nature. The motions
in which resides the mutability of all things are not yet represented in their
precise measure. At this point an appropriate formula for a law of motion
is still lacking. The judgment of later, more progressive times, is indulgent
enough not to ridicule this beginner's attempt at scientific research. It even
finds it to be perfecdy in order that a first attempt at the observation of
nature should describe processes in things in terms of those familiar from
the human sphere. This is why Ana.ximander's saying speaks of justice and

A!\'AXIMANI>ER'S SA YI�G

injustice, punishment and penalty, sin and recompense in relation to things.
Moral and legal concepts infiltrate the picture of nature. Thus Theophrastus
criticizes Anaximander for 1TOIT\TIKWTEpOIS

o{hws 6v61,1aC11V mna Mywv,

for speaking more poetically than is necessary. Theophrastus has in mind
the words

SiKT\, Tia1s, 6:61Kia, SJS6va1 SIKT\V . . .

First and foremost, what we must do is to determine what the subject
matter of the saying is. Only then will we be able to tell what it says about it.
From a grammatical point of view the saying consists of two sentences.
The first begins: e�

wv Se ..; yeveals EC1TI TOiS OUC11 . . . The topic of discussion
is the OVTa. Literally translated, Ta OVTa means "the being." The neuter
plural names Tel 1ToAM, "the many," in the sense of the multiplicity of
beings. But Tel ovTa does not mean an arbitrary or boundless multiplicity:
rather, TCx 1T<iVTa, the totality of beings. Hence Ta ovTa designates the
multiplicity of beings as a whole. The second sentence begins: SJS6va1 yap
alha . . . The miTCx refers back to the Tois OUC11 of the first sentence.
The saying speaks about the manifold being. Not only things, how­

ever, belong an10ng beings. In the fullest sense, things are not just natural
things. Human beings, the things they produce, and the situations and
circumstances effected and realized by human actions and omis.'iions be­
long, too, among beings. And so do daemonic and divine things. All these
things are not merely "also" beings, they are even more in being than mere

Ta ovTa are
OVTa, natural things in the narrower sense, is completely ground­
less. It is, for our translation, untenable. But even the translation of Ta OVTa
things. The Aristotelian-Theophrastean presupposition that
the cpucm

as "the things" does not suit the matter which comes to language in the
saying.
If, however, the presupposition that the saying is concerned to say some­
thing about natural things fails, then so does all support for the assertion
that what, strictly speaking, should be represented in the language of natural
science is still interpreted in moral and legal terms. With the collapse of the
presupposition that the saying strives for knowledge about the specifically
demarcated realm of nature another assumption becomes invalid, namely,
that at this time the ethical

[sittliche]

and the just were thought in terms of

academic disciplines called "ethics" and "jurisprudence." The denial of such
boundaries between disciplines does not at all mean that those early times
recognized no law or ethics. If, however, our usual way of thinking within
a range of disciplines (physics, ethics, phil�sophy of law, biology, psychol­
ogy) has, here, no place, then, where boundaries between disciplines are
absent, there is no possibility of boundary transgression, no possibility of

2 49

OFF T H E B EATEK TRACK

the illegitimate transfer of representations from one area to another. The
absence of boundaries between disciplines docs not necessarily mean, how­
ever, the boundlessness of indeterminacy and flux. On the contrary, it can
well be that purely thought - free of over-simple categorization - the actual
structure of the matter comes to language.
The words

SIKT], aSJK(a, Tia•s have a broad signification which cannot

be enclosed within particular disciplines. "Broad," here, does not mean
extensive in the sense of flattened or thinned out, but rather far-reaching,
rich, and containing much that has been thought out. For this reason it
follows that precisely these and only these words arc capable of bringing to
language the manifold totality in the essence of its authentic unity. For that
to happen the unified totality of the manifold, with its own characteristics,
must, of course, be thought purely as it is in itself.
This way ofletting the manifold being come, in its unity, to essential view
is anything but a kind of primitive and anthropomorphic representation.
In order to trans-late ourselves into that which comes to language in the
saying we must, prior to all translating, consciously set aside all inappropri­
ate preconceptions. For example, that the saying deals with the philosophy
of nature in a way such that inappropriate notions from morality and the
law are mixed into the discussion. Or that sharply separated representations
taken from the specialized areas of nature, ethics, and jurisprudence arc rel­
evant to the discussion. Or, finally, that a primitive outlook still prevails in
the saying which interprets the world uncritically and anthropomorphically,
and therefore takes refuge in poetic expressions.
However, even this casting aside of presuppositions wherever we find
them inappropriate is insufficient so long as we fail to allow ourselves to
be drawn into and to listen for that which comes to language in the say­
ing. Only from out of such listening will one succeed in having a dia­
logue with early Greek thinking. It belongs to such a dialogue that the
conversation speaks of the same thing, indeed out of a participation in
the same. According to its wording, the saying speaks of the

oVTa. It ex­

presses what and how it is with them. Beings are spoken of in such a way
that their being is expressed. Being comes to language as the being of
beings.
At the summit of the completion of Western philosophy the following
words are said: "To stamp becomi ng with the character of being - that is the

highest will to power." Thus wrote �ietzsche in a note entitled "Recapitula­
tion." Going by the character of the handwriting we must locate the note in
the year I 88s, the time at which, having completed Zarathustm, he planned

ANAXIMAND ER'S SAYING

his gTeat work of systematic metaphysics. "Being," as Nietzsche thinks it
here, is "the eternal return of the same." It is the mode of pem1anence in
which the will to power wills itself and secures its own presencing as the
being of becoming. This is how the being of beings is expressed in the final
stage of the completion of metaphysics.
Although the early aphorism of early thinking and the late aphorism of
recent thinking bring to language the same, what they say is not the same.
Nonetheless, if we can speak of the same being addressed from out of the
different, then the fundamental condition for a thoughtful dialogue between
the late and the early is automatically fulfilled.
Or does that merely seem to be the case? Does there lie concealed beneath
this appearance the gulf between the language of our thinking and the
language of Greek philosophy? Only if we take Ta oVTa to mean "the being"
and dva1 to mean nothing other than "to be" do we cross whatever gulfs
there may be and - in spite of all the differences between the ages - place
ourselves together with the ancient thinkers in the region of the same. This
same validates for us the translation of TCx oVTa and eTva1 as "the being" and
"to be." Or to demonstrate the unimpeachable correctness of this translation
do we need first to produce as evidence a broad selection of texts from Greek
philosophy? All interpretations of Greek philosophy are based already on
this translation. Every dictionary gives us the fullest information to the effect
that eTva1 means "to be," eaTIV "is," ov "being," and Ta oVTa "the being."
This is how things stand. We have no intention of casting doubt on any of
it. We do not question the translation ofov as "being," nor that of eTva1 as "to
be." We ask, merely, whether in these correct translations correct thinking
is occurring. We ask, merely, whether, in these most commonplace of all
translations, anything at all is thought.
Let us put it to the test. Let us examine ourselves and others. Here
something manifests itself: that in these correct translations everything
evaporates into fluctuating and imprecise meanings. It becomes clear that
the always hasty approximations of the familiar translations arc not seen
as an inadequacy nor do they disturb, in the slightest, scholarly research
and presentation. Greater efforts arc perhaps made to bring out what the
Greeks may have really represented to themselves with words like 6e6s,
o/VXfl . �w,;, TVX'Il· xaplS, Myos, cpVO"IS and !Sea, TEXV'Il and i:vepyela. But
what we fail to notice is that these and similar efforts get nowhere and fail
to refer to any realm, so long as that real m of all realms, the ov and the
eTva1, is insufficiently clarified in its Greek essence. Scarcely, however, have
we named eTva1 a "realm" than its character as a realm is represented as

This grasping-together

concept is supposed, in advance, to be the only possible way in which to
think being as such. It is still taken to be applicable when one takes refuge in
the dialectic of concepts

[Begriffi] or in the un-graspahility (Un-Bewiffliche)

of magic signs. It remains completely forgotten that the supremacy of
the concept and the interpretation of thinking as conceptually grasping is
based solely on the unthought - because unexperienced - essence of the
and

ov

eTvat.

In the main we thoughtlessly attribute to the words

ov and eTvat that

which we mean by the corresponding (but unthought) words of our own
language: beings and being. To be precise, we attribute to the Greek words
no significance at all. We adopt them directly from whatever vague com­
prehensibility is lent to them by the ordinary understanding of our own
language. We support the Greek words with nothing but the accommodat­
ing negligence of hasty opinion. This may do at a pinch when we read, for
example,

elvat and eo-rtv in the historical works of Thucydides or i'jv and

eo-rat in Sophocles.
How is it, however, when

TCx oVTa, ov and eTvat come to sound in lan­

guage as the fundamental words of thinking; not just some particular way
of thinking, but rather as the key words for all Western thinking? Then an
examination of the use of language in the translation reveals the following
state of affairs:
It is neither clear nor firmly established what we ourselves think with the
words "being" and "to be";
nor is it clear or firmly established whether what we variously mean

ov and eTvat.
It is neither clear nor firmly established what ov and eTvat, thought in the

corresponds to what the Greeks talk about with the words
Greek marmer, say;
nor, given this situation,

can

we ever conduct an examination of whether,

and to what extent, our thinking corresponds to that of the Greeks.
Thus, simple relations arc thoroughly confused and unthought. Within
them, however, and hovering above them, a boundless chatter about being
has spread itself far and wide. In conjunction with the formal correctness
of the translation of ov and

eTvat as "being" and "to be," this continually

covers over the confused state of affairs. But it is not only we of today
who wander about in this confusion. All representations and presentations
left to us by the philosophy of the Greeks remain in it, too, captivated for
millennia. The confusion stems neither from mere philological negligence

ANAXIMA.l'<D ER'S SAYING

nor from an imprecision in historical research. It arises, rather, out of the
abyss of the relationship in which being" has appropriated the essence of
Western humanity. Thus the confusion cannot be removed by creating, via
some kind of a definition, a more precise meaning of the words ov and
elvat, "being" and "to be." On the contrary, the attempt to be aware of the
confusion and to bring its dogged power to a resolution may well prove to
be the occasion which releases another destiny of being. The preparation
of such an occasion would be reason enough to set in motion, within the
abiding confusion, a dialogue with early thinking.
If we stubbornly insist on thinking Greek thought in a Greek manner,
this is by no means because we intend to produce a portrait of the Greeks as
a past humanity intended to be, in numerous respects, more accurate. We
seek what is Greek neither for the sake of the Greeks nor for the advance­
ment of science. We seek a dearer dialogue not for its own sake but solely
for the sake of that which wishes to come to language in such a dialogue,
provided it comes of its own accord. This is that same which, in different
ways, is destined to concern both the Greeks and us. It is that which brings
the dawn of thinking into the destiny of the West. It is as a consequence
of this destiny that the Greeks first became, in the historical sense, the
Greeks.
A.., we use the word, "Greek" designates neither an ethnic nor national,
neither a cultural nor an anthropological characteristic. What is Greek is
that dawn of destiny as which being itselfb lights itself up in beings and lays
claimc to an essence of humanity, a humanity which, as destined, receives
its historical path, a path sometimes preserved in, sometimes released from,
but never separated from being.
The Greek, the Christian, the modern, the global, and, in the already
indicated sense, the Evening-land, we think out of a fundamental trait of
being which, as the 'Ai'.1)6eta in the /\1)61'), is more concealed than revealed.
But this concealing of its essence and essential origin is the trait in which
being's primordial self-illumination occurs, occurs, indeed, so that thinking
can precisely not pursue it. The being itself does not step into the light of
being. The unconcealment of the being, the brightness granted it, darkens
the light of being.
By revealing itself in the being, being withdraws.

In this way, in its illuminating, being invests the being with errancy. The
being happens in errancy in which it strays from being and so - to speak in
the manner of princes and poets - founds error. This is the essential space
of history. In it the historically essential strays past what is like being. This
is why what happens historically is necessarily misinterpreted. Throughout
this misinterpretation destiny waits for what will become of its seed. It
brings those whom it concerns into the possibility of the destined and the
un-destined. Destiny tries out its destiny. 'The inability of human beings to
sec themselves corresponds to the self-concealment of the lighting ofbeing.
Without errancy there would be no connection from destiny to destiny,
no history. Chronological distance and causal sequence belong to histori­
ography, but not to history. \Vhen we arc historical we are at neither a large
nor a small distance from the Greek. But we are in errancy toward them.
By revealing itself in the being, being withdraws.
In this way being, with its truth, keeps to itself. This keeping to itself is
the way it discloses itself early on. Its early sign is the ' A-A.Tj6e1a. By bringing
the being's unconcealmcnt, it founds, for the first time, the concealment of
being. Concealment remains, however, the characteristic of the refusal that
keeps to itself.
This illuminating, keeping to itself with the truth of its essence, we may
call the rnox1'J of being. Here, however, this word which is taken from the
language of the Stoics does not mean, as it does for Husserl, the method­
ological setting aside of the act of thctic consciousness in objectification.
The epoche of being belongs to being itself. We think it out of the oblivion
of being.
Out of the epoche of being comes the epochal essence of its destining
in which authentic world-history lies. Each time that being keeps to itself
in its destiny, suddenly and unexpectedly, world happens. Every epoch of
world-history is an epoch of errancy. The epochal essence of being belongs
to the concealed temporal character of being and indicates the essence of
"timc"3 thought from within being. \Vhat one may otherwise represent by
this term is only the vacuity of the appearance of time derived from beings
thought of as objects.
For us, however, the correlate of the epochal character of being we
can experience most immediately is the ecstatic [ekstatische] character of
Da-sein [being-there). The epochal essence of being appropriates the

Epochally thought, the beginning of the epoch of being lies in what we
call "the Greek." This beginning, which is itself to be thought epochally, is
the dawn of the destiny in being from out of being.
Little depends on what we represent and present to ourselves from the
past; but a great deal depends on the manner in which we arc mindful of
the destined. Can this ever happen without thinking? If it happens, how­
ever, then we abandon the claims of shortsighted opinion and open our­
selves to the claim of destiny. Docs this claim speak in the early saying of
Anaximander?
We are not certain whether its claim speaks to our essence. It re­
mains open to question whether the glance - and this mean.o; the lightning

of what has been.

hend what it says, the

Only in the brilliance of this glance can we trans-late ourselves into what
is said in the saying so as then, in a thoughtful dialogue, to make the trans­
lation. Perhaps the confusion which permeates the use of the words
and

ovTa

eTvm, the being and being, comes not so much from the fact that the

language cannot say everything adequately but rather from the fact that we
do not think the matter with sufficient clarity. Lessing once said: "language
can express everything we think clearly." So it is up to us to watch out for
the right opportunity which allows us clearly to think the matter which the
saying brings to language.
We arc inclined to discover the opportunity we are looking for in the
saying of Anaximander. But in this case we still fail to pay attention to what
the way of translation requires.
For what is necessary before interpreting the saying is to trans-late our­
selves - at first without the help of the saying - to the place from which
what is said in the saying comes; to, that is to say, Ta oVTa. This word names
that of which the saying speaks, not only what it expresses. That of which it

speaks is already, before its expression, what is spoken about by the Greek
language in both its everyday and its elevated usc. For this reason we must
seek the opportunity which allows us to trans-late ourselves outside the
saying itself, in order to discover what TCx

oVTa, thought in the Greek way,

says. Furthermore, we must at first remain outside the saying because we
have not yet delineated its terms. This delineation is ultimately (first of all
in the matter, that is) governed by the knowledge of what in early times
was thought and thinkable in !mch tcnns - as distinct from the prevailing
representations of later times.
The text quoted and translated above from Simplicius' commentary on
the

Physics has

traditionally been accepted as the saying of Anaximander.

However, the quotation in the commentary is not clear enough for it to be
possible to say with certainty where Anaximander's saying begins and where
it ends. Even today there are leading authorities on the Greek language who
accept the text of the saying in the form in which it was introduced at the
beginning of our reflections.

In fact, however, John Burnet, the distinguished and important scholar

of Greek philosophy to whom we are indebted for the edition of Plato,
alreaJy expresses doubts, in his F.arly

Greek Philosophy,

as to whether the

Simplicius quotation begins where it is usually said to begin.

In criticism of

Diels, Burnet says
Diels . . . begins the actual quotation with the words t� wv SE ti y�vea•s

. . .

The Greek

practice of weaving quotation into the text speaks against this. It is very rare for a
Greek writer to begin immediately with a literal quotation. It is, moreover, safer not
to ascribe the terms yevea•s and cp6op6:, in the technical sense they have in Plato, to
Anaximander.
(Second edition, 1 908. German translation, 1 9 1 3, p. 43, foomote 4)

On the basis of these considerations Burnet has Anaximandcr's saying
beginning only with

KCITCx TO xpeC:JV. What Burnet says about Greek quota­

tion in general speaks in favour of excluding what precedes these words. On
the other hand his remarks based on the terminological use of the words

yevea•s and cp6op6: cannot be accepted as they stand. That yevea•s and cp6op6:
are firmly established conceptual terms in Plato and Aristotle, and therefore
become academic terms, is correct. But yevea1s and

cp9op6: are old words, al­

ready known to Homer. Anaximander would not have used them as concep­
tual terms. He cannot have used them in this way since conceptual language
is something necessarily foreign to him. For this first became possible with
the interpretation of being as

i5ea, after which it indeed becomes inevitable.

ANAXIMA:-.JDER'S SAYI:-.JG

Nevertheless, the whole of the sentence that precedes KCXTCx TO xpeC:w is,
in terms of construction and sound, far more Aristotelian than archaic. The
same later character is betrayed by the KCXTCx -n;v TOV xp6vov TCx�IV at the
end of the customarily accepted text. Whoever is persuaded to strike out the
part of the text found dubious by Burnet cannot retain the usually accepted
closing part either. What would therefore remain as the original saying of
Anaximander is only this:
. . . KCITa TO xpewv· StS6vat yap a\n'a SiKflV Kal Tiaw 6:��TJ�OIS Tiis 6:StKias.

. . . according to necessity; for they pay one another punishment and penalty for
their injustice.

These are precisely the words in reference to which Theophrastus notes
that Anaximander speaks in a more poetic way. Since the whole issue one which often comes up in my lectures - is one I thought through a
few years ago, I am inclined to take only these words as the immediately
genuine words of Anaximander, albeit with the proviso that the preceding
part of the text is not simply abandoned but is rather retained, on the ba­
sis of the strength and eloquence of its thought, as secondary testimony
concerning Anaximander's thought. This requires that we understand, in
particular, the words yevea1s and <p6op6: as they were thought in Greek,
whether they be pre-conceptual words or Platonic-Aristotelian conceptual
terms.
Accordingly, yevea1s in no way means the genetic in the sense of the
developmental as conceived in modem times; <p6op6: does not mean the
counter-phenomenon to development, as though it involved some kind of
regression, shriveling, or wasting away. Rather, they are to be thought out of
and within <pvats: as ways of self-illuminating rising and decline. Certainly
one can translate yevea1s as emergence; but we must think this emergence
as an escape which allows every emergent thing to rise out of concealment
and come forth into unconcealment. Certainly we can translate <p6op6: as
"passing away"; but in doing so we must think passing away as a movement
which again originates in the unconcealed and departs and withdraws into
concealment.
Presumably Anaximander spoke of yevea1s and <p6op6:. \Vhether he did so
in the form of the traditional statement remains questionable. Nonetheless
word-conjunctions as paradoxical as yeveats'eaTIV (as I would like to read it)
and <p6opa yivETal "coming into being is" and "passing away comes to be"
- again suggest an ancient language. The yeveC'Is is the coming forth and

cp6op6 means: the departure and descent

into concealment of that which has arrived there out of unconcealment. The
"coming forward into . . . " and the "going away to . . . " presence within
unconcealment between the concealed and the unconcealed. They concern
the arrival and departure of what has arrived.

yE\IeO"Js and cp6op6. The saying speako; of

that which, in coming forth, arrives in unconcealment and, having arrived
there, withdrawing, departs.
What, however, has its essential nature in such arrival and departure we
would prefer to call the coming and the going rather than the being; for we
have, for a long time, been accustomed to opposing becoming and being, as
if becoming were nothing, not belonging within being, which has for a long
time been understood as mere perdurance. If, however, becoming is, then
we must think being in so essential a manner that it embraces becoming not
in an emptily conceptual way hut rather so that being bears and molds the
essence of becoming (yevea•s

- cp6op6) in an essential way.

Hence, whether, and with what right, we represent becoming as the
transitory docs not, here, require discussion. \Vhat does, rather, need to be
discussed is the question of what essence of being the Greeks think when,
in the realm of the

ovoa, they experience coming forth and going away as

the fundamental trait of arrival.
What is it that finds expression in their language when the Greeks
say

TCx ovoa? \Vhere is there, apart from Anaximander's saying, a guide­

line that would trans-late us there? Since the word in question, together
with its variations

EO"TIV, f)v, EO"TaJ, elva1, speaks everywhere throughout

the entire language - before, indeed, thinking specifically takes this word
as its fundamentaJ term - we must become cognizant of an opportunity

A;\!AX IMANDER'S SAYI:".. G

which, in tenns of subject matter, time, and the realm to which it belongs,
lies outside philosophy and, in every respect, precedes what thinking has
to say.
We find this opportunity in I Iomer. In him, we possess a passage where
the word comes to the fore in a more than merely lexical way. It is a passage,
rather, in which what oVTa names is brought to language poetically. Because
all AE�t� of the lexicographical son presupposes the thought of the AEyoj.tevov,
we will refrain from the futile assembly of parallel passages, a practice which,
all too often, only goes to show that none of the texts have been thought
through. With the help of this much-favored method it is supposed that,
by shoving an unclarified passage together with other equally unclarified
passages, clarity will suddenly emerge.
The passage we seek to explicate comes from the beginning of the first
book of the

Iliad,

lines 68-72 . It gives us an opponunity to transport our­

selves over into what the Greeks name with the word

ovTa, provided we

allow the poet to carry us over to the distant shore of what is being said.
Some preliminary remark., concerning the history of language are nec­
essary with respect to what follows. These observations cannot claim to
present the philological problem on which they touch adequately, still less
to solve it. In Plato and Aristotle,

ov and oVTa confront us as conceptual

words. The later terms "ontic" and "ontological" are formed from them.
Linguistically, however,

ov and oVTa are presumably forms of the original

e6v and e6VTa which have somehow become abbreviated. Only in
the original words is the sound still preserved with which we say eov and
EOVTa. The epsilon in e6v and EOVTa is the e in the root of EO', in EO'TIV, est,
esse, and "is." In contrast, ov and oVTa look like rootless participial endings,

words

as though, by themselves, they specifically designate what we must think
in those word forms called by grammarians

j.IETOXTJ, participium;

in other

words, those word fom1s which participate in the verbal and nominal sense
of a word.
Thus

ov says "being" in the sense of to be a being; but ov also names a
is. In the duality of the participial signification of ov there lies

being which

concealed the distinction between "being

[seiend]" and "a being [Seiendem]."

Thus represented, what is here set forth looks at first sight like a grammatical
splitting ofhairs. ln truth, however, it is the enigma of being. The participle

ov is the word for that which, in metaphysics, appears as the transcendental
and the transcendent transcendence.

·

Archaic Greek, and so, too, Parmenides and Heraclitus, use e6v and E6VTa
all the time.

But e6v, "being [seiend]," is not only the singular of the participle S6vra,
"the being [Seimdes]," but also names the singular as such, which, as one
in its singleness, is uniquely the uniquely unifying One that precedes all
number.
We might say - in an exaggerated way which nevertheless touches on
the truth - that the destiny of the West rests on the translation of the word
e6v, given that the translation [ UbetJ'etztmg] is a crossing over [ Ube1J'etzmzg]
to the truth of what comes to language in the e6v.
What does Homer tell us about this word? We know the situation of
the Achaeans before Troy at the beginning of the Iliad. For nine days
the plague sent by Apollo has raged in the Greek camp. At the assembly
of the warriors Achilles commands Kalchas, the seer, to interpret the wrath
of the god:

seen genuinely sees. To see is to have seen. What is seen has arrived and
remains for him in sight. A seer has always seen already. Having seen al­
ready he sees in advance. He sees the future tense out of the perfect. When
the poet speaks of the seer's seeing as a having-seen he must say what the
seer saw in the pluperfect: iJ5TJ, he had seen. What is it that has come to
the seer's sight in advance? Obviously it can only be that which is present
in the light that illuminates his sight. What is seen in such a seeing can
only be that which, through unconcealment, comes to presence. But what
comes to presence? The poet names something threefold: Ta T' e6vra, the

ANAXIMANDER'S SAY I NG

Ta e6VTa is dis­
tinguished from both TCx EC"C"OilEVa and 1Tp6 E6VTa. Accordingly, TCx e6VTa
The first thing we gather from the poetic word is that

designates the being in the sense of the present. When we latecomers speak
of "the present" either we mean what is "now" - representing this as some­
thing that is within time, the "now" counting as a phase within the flow

[gegenwiMig]" into relation to the objective
[Gegenstiindigen]. As something objective [dos Objedive] this is related to a

of time - or we bring "present

representing subject. If, however, we want to use "present" for a more accu­
rate comprehension of e6VTa, then we must understand "present" from out
of the essence of e6VTa and not vice versa. But e6vTa embraces, too, what
is past and what is in the future. Both constitute a way of being a present
being, namely, being an unpresently

[tmgegenwiit"tig]

present being. Clari­

fying matters, the Greeks called the presently present

Ta 1Tape6VTa; 1rap6:

means "alongside,'' that is, having arrived alongside in unconcealment. The

"gegen

[against] " in

"gegenwiirtig

[present]" does not mean standing over

against a subject, but rather the open region [ Gegend] of unconcealment
into and within which that which has arrived lingers

(verweilt]. Accordingly,

"present," as a trait of the e6vTa is equivalent to: having arrived for a while
within the region of unconcealment. Spoken first, and thereby emphasized,

e6VTa, which is expressly distinguished from both 1Tpoe6VTa and ecrcr61-1eva,
names, for the Greeks, that which is present insofar as, in the explicated
sense, it has arrived in the while within the region of unconcealment. This
coming hither is the authentic arriva l, the presencing of what is authenti­
cally present. What is past and future are also present, present, that is to
say, out'lide the region of unconcealment. The unpresently present is the
absent. As such, it remains essentially related to the presently present, inso­
far as it either comes forth into the region of unconcealment or withdraws
from it. The absent is also present and, as absent from it, presences in un­
concealment. Both what is past and what is to come are e6VTa. Accordingly,

e6v means: presencing in unconcealment.
This clarification of E6VTa reveals that within Greek experience, too,
that which is present remains ambiguous, indeed necessarily so. Ta e6VTa
means on the one hand the presently present, on the other, however, both
the presently and unpresently present. However, that which is present in
the broader sense must never be represented

as

the general concept of

presence (as opposed to a particular, presently present presence), though this
is the usual procedure of conceptual thinking. For, in fact, it is precisely the
presently present and the unconcealment that prevails in it, which pervades
the essence of the absent as that which is unpresently present.

261

OFF THE BEATE:--1 TRACK

The seer stands in the sight of what is present in its unconcealment,
which at the same time has illuminated the concealment of the absent as
the absent. The seer sees inasmuch as he has seen everything as something
present; Kal, and only on that account, viJeaa' tiyiJaa-r', was he able to guide
the Achaean ships on to Troy. He was able to do this through the God-given
IJavrooVvr,. The seer, 6 IJCXV"ns, is the 1Jalv61Jevos, the madman. But what is it
that constin1tes the essence of this madness? The madman is beside, outside,
himself. I Ie is away. We ask: away to where? And from where? Away from the
mere crush of what lies before us, of the merely presently present, and away
to the absent; away to, at the same time, the presently absent, inasmuch as
this is always only the arrival of something that departs. The seer is outside
himself in the single breadth of the presence of that which is in every way
present. Therefore, within this breadth, he is able to find his way back from
the "away," back to what is present here and now, namely, the raging plague.
The madness of the seer's being-away does not consist in raving, rolling the
eyes or contorting the limbs. The madness of seeing is compatible with the
unprepossessing quietness of bodily composure.
For the seer, everything present and absent is gathered and preserved
[gewahrt) in o11e presencing. The old German word "war [was]" means
preservation. It is still known to us in "wah171ehmen [to perceive]," that is, to
take into preservation; in "gewah1·en [to become aware of]" and "ve1'Wahren
[to keep or preserve] ." We must think ofwahren as an illuminating-gathering
sheltering. Presencing preserves [wahrt] that which presences in unconceal­
ment, both what is present now and what is not. The seer speaks from out of
the preservation [ Wtihr] of presencing. He is the sooth-sayer [ WOhr-sage1·] .
Here, we think the preservation in the sense of illuminating-sheltering
gathering; what shows itself here is a fundamental trait of presencing that is, of being - that has been long concealed. One day we will learn to
think our exhausted word "truth [ WOhrheit]" from out of the protection
[Wahr] and learn that truth is the preservation [Wtlhrms] of being, and that
being, as presence, belongs to it. Preservation as the protection of being
belongs to the shepherd; a shepherd who has so little to do with bucolic
idylls and nature mysticism that he can become the shepherd of being only
if he remains the place-holder for the N"othing. Both are the same. Man
can do both only within the dis-closedness [Ent-schlossenheit] of Da-sein
[being-there] .
The seer is h e who has already seen the totality o f what presences in
its presencing. In Latin vidit, in German "er steht im Wissen [he stands in
knowledge]." Having seen is the essence of knowledge. In this having seen
262

Ar-oAX I MAr-oD E R ' S SAYII'o:G

there is always something more in play than the completion of an optical
process. In the having seen, the relationship to what presences has gone
behind every kind of sensory and non-sensory apprehension. What follows
is that the having seen is related to the self-illuminating presencing. The
seeing is determined, not by the eye but by the lighting of being. Standing
within this lighting is the structure of all human senses. The essence of
seeing, as having seen, is knowledge. This retains sight. It remaino; mind­
ful of presencing. Knowledge is the remembrance of being. This is why
MVTJilOaVVTJ is the mother of the muses. Knowledge is not science in the
modem sense. Knowledge is the thoughtful awareness of the preservation
of being.
Whither have Homer's words trans-lated [iiber-gesetzt] us? To the e6VTa.
The Greeks experience the being as that which is present (whether presently
so or not), present in unconccalment. Our usc of "being" to translate ov is
no longer obtuse; "to be" as the translation of eTva1 and the Greek word
itself are no longer hastily employed codewords for arbitrary and vague
representations of indeterminate generality.
At the same time it transpires that being, as the presencing of what is
present, is already in itself truth, given that we think the essence of truth
as the illuminating-sheltering gathering; that we steer clear of the later
prejudice of metaphysics (these days regarded as something self-evident)
that truth is a characteristic of the being or of being. Being (the word now
thoughtfully spoken), eTva1 as presencing, is, in a concealed way, a charac­
teristic of truth, though not, certainly, truth as a characteristic of divine or
hwnan knowledge, and not as a characteristic in the sense of quality. Fur­
thermore, it has become clear that Tel EOVTQ ambiguously names both the
presently ami unpresently present, the latter, understood with reference to
the former, constituting the absent. The presently present, however, is not
something that lies, like a severed slice, sandwiched between two absences.
When that which is present stands, in advance, in seeing, everything pres­
ences together; one thing brings the others with it, another allows the other
to go. That which stands presently in unconcealment stays [weilt] in it as the
open region. That which presently stays (whiles) [ Weilende (Weilige)] in that
region comes forth into it, into unconcealment, from out of concealment.
But the arrival which stays is what is present insofar as it is already on its way
from unconcealment into concealment. The presently present stays awhile.
It lingers [verweilt) in coming forth and going away. The stay is the transition
from coming to going. What is present is what, in each case, lingers awhile.
Lingering awhile, it lingers still in arrival and lingers already in departure.

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

\Vhat is for the time being present, the presently present, presences out
of absence. This must be said precisely of whatever is truly present, which
our usual mode of representation would like to segregate from all that is
absent.

Ta e6vra names the unified multiplicity of whatever stays awhile. To the
extent it is present in unconcealment, everything presences, in its own way,
to everything else.
Finally, we gather something else from the passage in Homer: Ta e6vra,
the so-called being, in no way means natural things. In the present case, the
poet uses

e6vra to refer to the situation of the Achaeans before Troy: the

anger of the god, the raging of the plague, the funeral pyres, the perplexity
of the princes, and so on. Ta e6vra, in the language ofHomer, is not a philo­
sophical concept-word but rather a word that is thought and thoughtfully
uttered. It does not name merely the things of nature, and does not name
at all objects which are nothing but objects of human representing. Man,
too, belongs to e6vTa: he is that present being which, lighting-apprehending
and so gathering, allows that which presences to presence as such in un­
concealment. If, in the poetic characterization of Kalchas, what is present
is thought in relation to the seeing of the seer, this means that, thought in
the Greek manner, the seer, as one who has seen, is a present being who
in an exceptional sense belongs to the totality of what presences. This docs
not, however, mean that what presences is, or is only,

an

object dependent

on the subjectivity of the seer.

Ta e6vra, the presently and unpresently present, is the inconspicuous
name of that which comes expressly to language in Anaximander's saying.
The word names that which, as the still unspoken - unspoken in thinking ­
addresses all thought. The word names that which, whether spoken or not,
henceforth lays claim to all Western thinking.
But only several decades after Anaximander, through Parn1enides, did

e6v (presencing) and elval (to presence) expressly become the fundamental
words of Western thinking. This, admittedly, did not happen - as the
popular misconception has it - because Parmenides interprets the being
"logically," proceeding from the proposition and its copula. Within Greek
thinking, not even Aristotle goes that far when he thinks the being�'> being in
terms of the KCXTflyopla. Aristotle took the being as something already lying
before any proposition, as, that is to say, the unconcealment of what pres­
ences for a while. For Aristotle, it was not necessary to explicate lrrroKEh,Jevov,
substance, in terms of the subject of the proposition since the essence of the
substance,

ovala in the sense of 1Tapovaia, was already manifest. And neither

ANAXIMA:-.I DER'S SAYING

did he think the presence of what is present in terms of the objectivity of
the propositional object. Rather, he thought it as evepyeta which, however,
is separated by an abyss from the

nm111litas of the actus punt,f of medieval

scholasticism.
In any case, Parmenides' ecntv docs not mean the "is" which is the
copula of the sentence. It names e6v, the presencing of what is present.
The ecntv corresponds to the pure claim of being before the division into
first and second ovaia, into

existmtia

and

essentia.

But in this way e6v is

thought out of the concealed and hidden richness of the unconcealment
of the e6vTa, which was familiar to the early Greeks, without it being pos­
sible or necessary for them to experience this essential richness in all its
aspects.
It is from out of the thoughtful experience of the e6v of the 1:6VTa, non­
conceptually spoken, that the fundamental words of the early thinking are
said: <l>uats and A6yos, Moipa and "Epts, 'AA.T)6eta and "Ev. Only by means of
"Ev, which is to be thought back into the realm of the fundamental words,
do e6v and elvat become the explicit words for what is present. Only from
out of the destiny of being, the destiny of the "Ev, does the modern age,
after essential upheavals, enter the epoch of the monadology of substance,
which completes itself in the phenomenology of Spirit.
It was not Parmenides who provided the logical interpretation of being.
On the contrary, it was logic - sprung from metaphysics but at the same time
dominating it - which led to a state of affairs in which the essential richness
of being contained in the early fundamental words, remained buried. This
is what made it possible for being to assume the fatal status of being the
emptiest and most universal concept.
Yet since the dawn of thinking "being" names the presencing of what
is present in the sense of the lighting-sheltering gathering which is how
the A6yos is thought and named. The A6yos (A.Eyetv, to gather or collect)
is experienced out of 'AA.T)6eta, the sheltering which discloses. In the con­
flicted essence of 'AA.T)6eta is concealed the thoughtful essence of Epts and
Moipa, in terms of which <l>uats is at the same time named.
"

It is within the language of these fundamental words, words which
are thought from out of the experience of presencing, that the words of
Anaximander's saying Speak: 5iKT], Tiats, and Cx5tK{a.
The claim of being which speaks in these words determines the essence
of philosophy. Philosophy does not arise from myth. It comes into being
only out of, and in, thinking. But this thinking is the thinking of being.
Thinking does not come into being. It is insofar as being presences. But the
z6s

OFF TH E B EATEN TRACK

collapse3 of thought into the sciences and into faith is the balefu)b destiny
of being.
At the dawn of being's destiny, the being, Ta E6VTa, comes to language.
What, from out of the measured abundance of what in this way arrives, does
Anaximander's saying bring to utterance?
According to what looks to be the genuine text, the saying reads
. . . KCITCx TO XPEWV" 6t6ovat yap a\rra 6iKT'lV Kai TiatV aAAflAOIS TfiS a6tKias.
In the standard translation:
. . . according to nccc.o;sity; for they pay one another punishment and penalty for
their injustice.

The saying still consists of two clauses; of the first only the final words are
preserved. We begin with the explication of the second clause.
The aU-ra refers to what is named in the previous clause. What is meant
can only be Ta

oVTa, what presences in its totality, presendy and unpresendy

present in uncnncealment. Whether or not this is expressly named by the
word may, on account of the uncertainty surrounding the text, he left open.
The roiTa names everything that is present, everything that presences in
the manner of staying: gods and men, temples and cities, sea and land, eagle
ami snake, tree and shrub, wind and light, stone and sand, day and night.
The things that presence belong together in the unity of presencing in as
much as each presences to the others within its duration. This multiplicity

(1ToAA6:) is not an assembly of separate objects behind which something
stands, embracing them as a whole. Rather, in presencing as such there
prevails the staying-with-one-another of a concealed gathering. This is why
Heraclitus, catching sight of this collecting-unifying and disclosing essence
within presencing, calls the "Ev (the being's being) the

/\6yos.

But first of all, how does Anaximander experience the totality of the
things that presence: their having arrived to stay awhile with one another in
unconcealment? What is it, basically, that runs everywhere through what is
present? The last word of the saying gives the answer. It is with it that we
must begin the translation. The word name.c; the fundamental trait of what

faithfu1 to the word? In other words, does the word's literal translation pay
heed to what in the saying comes to language? Does the

a\rra, the totality

of what is present staying awhile in unconcealment, stand before our eyes?

I low is it that what presences, staying, stands in injustice? What is unjust
about the thing that presences? Docs it not have the right to stay awhile,
from time to time, and so fulfill its prcsencing?
The word

6:-5aKia says, first of all, that 5iKfl is absent. One is accustomed
to translate 5iKfl as "right." The translations even use "penalty." If we steer
clear of our judicial-moral representations, i f we stick to what comes to
language, then

6:5aKia says that where i t prevails, all is not right with things.

That means, something is out of joint. But what is being referred to? The
things that are present, stayi ng. But where, in what is present, are the joints?
Without joints, how can what presences be without jointure,

ci5aKov, that

is, out of joint?
The saying says, unambiguously, that what presences is in the 6:5aKia, that
is, out of joint. That, however, cannot mean that it is no longer present. But
neither does it merely say that what is present is just occasionally, or perhaps
with respect to some of its characteristics, out of joint. The saying says, of
what is present, that, as what is present, it is out of joint. The jointure
must belong to presencing as such together with the possibility of being out
of joint. What presences is what stays awhile. The while presences as the
transitional arrival in departure. It presences between coming hither and
going away. Between this twofold absence presences the presencing of all
that stays.

In this "between" what stays awhile is jointed. This "between"

is the jointure according to which, from arrival here to going away from
here, that which stays is jointed. The presencing of what stays obtrudes in
the "here" of "arrival here" and in the "away" of "going away." Presencing
is, in both directions, enjoined toward absence. Presencing occurs in this
jointure. What is present emergc.o; in the coming forth and passes away in
the going away; indeed, because it stays, it does both at the same time. The
while happens in the jointure.
But then that which stays awhile is precisely in the jointure of its prcs­
encing and not at all, as we can now say, in the dis-jointure, not in

6:5aKia.
But the saying says it is. It speaks from the essential experience of 6:5aKia as
the fundamental trait of e6vTa.
That which stays awhile presence.<; as staying in the jointure which enjoins
presence toward a twofold absence. Yet, as what prc.o;ences, that which stays
awhile - it and it alone - stays the length of i ts while. What has arrived
may even insist on its while, solely to remain more present, in the sense of

OFF THE B EATE;'I.l TRACK

enduring. That which stays persists in its prescncing. In this way it takes itself
out of its transitory while. It extends itself in a stubborn pose of persistence.
It concerns itself no longer with the other things that arc present. As though
this were the way to stay, it becomes concerned with the permanence of its
continued existence.
Presencing in the jointure of the while, that which presences, staying
awhile, is disjointed. Everything that stays awhile stands in this dis-jointure
[in dcr Un-Fuge]. U) the presence of what presences, to the �6v of EoVTa,
a61Kia belongs. Thus standing in the dis-jointure would be the essence of
everything that presences. And so what would come to the fore in this saying
of early thinking would be the pessimism - not to say nihilism - of the Greek
experience of being.
But does the saying actually say that the essence ofwhat presences consists
in the dis-jointure? Yes and no. The saying indeed identifies the dis-jointure
as the fundamental trait of what presences, yet only to say

"They must pay penalty or damages [Btljle]," as Nietzsche translates - "They
must pay the penalty or fine [Stmft]" according to Dicls - "for their injus­
tice." But the saying says nothing of payment, penalty, or damages. Nor
docs it say that something is punishable or must be avenged (according to
the opinion of those who equate vengeance with justice).
In the meantime, the thoughtlessly uttered "injustice of things" has been
clarified by our thinking the essence of that which presences and stays awhile
as the dis-jointure in the while. The dis-jointure consists in the fact that
what stays awhile tries to have its while understood only as continuation.
Thought from out of the jointure of the while, staying as persistence is
insurrection on behalf of sheer endurance. In prescncing as such - pres­
encing which lets everything that presences stay in the region of uncon­
ceahnent - continuance asserts itself. In this rebellious whiling, that which
stays awhile insists on sheer continuation. It presences, therefore, without
and against the jointure of the while. The saying does not say that ev­
erything that presences loses itself in the dis-jointure. It says, rather, that
that which stays awhile with a view to dis-jointure, 6!66va1 5iKT]V, gives
jointure.
What does "to give" mean here? How should that which stays awhile,
presences in dis-jointure, give jointure? Can it give what it does not have?
If it gives anything, does it not immediately give jointure away? Whither
268

and how does that which presences awhile give jointure? We must ask our
question more clearly, that is to say, from out of the matter itself.
I low should that which presences as such give the jointure of its presenc­

ing? The giving in question can consist only in the manner of presencing.
Giving is not only giving away. More primordial, is giving in the sense of
conceding. Giving of this kind I etc; belong to another what properly belongs

to him. What belongs to what presences is the jointure of the while which it
enjoins in its arrival and departure. In the jointure, that which stays awhile
keeps to its while. It does not strain to get away into the dis-jointure of
sheer persistence. The jointure belongs to what stays awhile which, in turn,
belongs in the jointure. The jointure

That which stays awhile presences in that it lingers; all the while emerging
and passing away, all the while the jointure of the transition from arrival
to departure continues. This lingering persistence of the transition is the
jointed continuance of what presences. It precisely does not insist on sheer
persistence. It does not

fall victim to dis-jointure. It overcomes dis-order.

Lingering, its while allows what stays awhile to belong to its essence as to
the presencing of order. The

8186va1 names this "letting-belong-to."

The prescncing of that which presences awhile does not consist in a81Kia
as such, not, that is, in disorder. Rather, in

8t86val 8iKTlV . . . Tfis a81Kias, in

the fact that in each case what presences lets order belong. The presently
present is not a slice that is cut off and shoved between the unpresently
present; it is present insofar as it allows itself to belong to the unpresent:

they, these same beings (in surmounting it) let the order of disorder belong.
The experience of the being in its being which here comes to language is
neither pessimistic nor nihilistic. Nor is it optimistic. It remains tragic. But
that is a presumptuous word. It is likely that we will be on the track of
the essence of the tragic if, rather than trying to explain it psychologically
or aesthetically, we think its essential mode of being, the being's being, by

presence give order? The saying has nothing direct to say about this, not,
at least, to the extent we have so far considered it. If we attend, however, to
the still untranslated portion it seems to say quite unambiguously to whom
or what it is directed:

The things which stay awhile let order belong aAAtiAo•s, to one another.
So we are generally accustomed to read the text. We relate the aAA..;AoJs to
the 5IKT]V and Tlow, if we represent matters clearly and explicitly as Diels
does (though Nietzsche's translation skips over the whole issue). It seems
to me, however, that relating the lxAAtiAo•s directly to the 5J56vaJ 51KT]V Kai
TiaJv is neither linguistically demanded nor, more importantly, justified by
the matter itself. Hence it is from the matter itself that we must ask whether
aAAtiAo•s immediately relates to 5IKT]V, or whether it does not rather relate
only to the TlaJv that inunediately precedes it. The discussion here partially
depends on how we translate the Kal that stands between 5iKT]V and Tla1v.
But this depends on what Tla•s says here.
One is accustomed to translate Tla•s as "penalty [BtifJe]." This leads us to
give 5J56VaJ the meaning of "pay." Whatever stays awhile pays penalty: it
makes this payment as punishment (5iKT]). The court of justice is complete:
not even injustice is missing, though admittedly no one is properly able to
say in what it consists.
Tla•s can indeed mean "penalty." It must, however, not do so since this
does not name the essential and original meaning of the word. For Tia•s
is "esteem." To esteem something means to pay heed to it and therefore
find satisfaction in what is estimable in it. The essential process of esteem,
the finding of satisfaction, can occur in what is good as the bestowing of
favour. But with respect to what is bad it can occur as penalty. This mere
explanation of the word, however, does not bring us to its matter in the
saying unless we are already, as with a61Kia and 51KT], thinking out of the
matter which comes to language in the saying.
According to the saying, cxV-r6: (Ta e6VTa), the things that stay awhile in
presence, stand in dis-order. As they while they tarry. They hang on. For in
the transition from arrival to departure they pass, hesitantly, through their
while. They hang on: they cling to themselves. When the things that stay
awhile hang on, they stubbomly follow the inclination to persist in such
hanging on, indeed to insist on it. They are concerned with permanent
continuance and no longer look to the 5IKT], the order of the while.

2 70

ANAXJMANDER'S SAYING

But in this way everything that tarries pushes itself forward in opposition
to everything else. None heeds the lingering essence of the others. The
things that stay awhile are without consideration toward each other: each
is dominated by the craving for persistence in the lingering presence itself,
which gives rise to the craving. For this reason things that stay awhile do
not just drift into sheer inconsiderateness. Inconsiderateness itself pushes
them into persistence in order that they may still presence as that which
presences. The totality of what presences does not disintegrate into merely
inconsiderate individuals, does not dis.'iipate it'ielf in discontinuity. Rather,
as the saying now says,
StS6vat . . . Tiatv &AM?.ots:

they, things which stay awhile, let one thing belong to another: consider­
ation toward each other. The translation of

Tla•s as consideration better

captures the essential meaning of paying heed and esteeming. It is thought
out of the prescncing of that which stays awhile. For us, however, the word
"consideration" applies too directly to human existence.

Tia•s, on the other

hand, because it is said more essentially, applies neutrally to everything that
is present:

a\rra (Ta e6VTa). Our word "consideration" lacks not merely the

necessary breadth but, above all, the gravity to serve as the translation of

Tla•s as it occurs in the saying, and as the word corresponding to 81KT1, order.
Now our language possesses an old word which, interestingly enough,
we moderns know only in its negative fonn and as a term of disparagement,
as with the word

Unfug

like inappropriate and vulgar behaviour, something perpetrated in a crude
manner.

"ntehlos [reckles.'> 2]," mean­

Insofar as things which stay awhile are not entirely abandoned to the
boundless fixation on aggrandizing themselves into sheerly persisting con­
tinuants - a craving which leads them to seek to expel one another from
what is presently present - they let order belong, S!S6va1 SIKllV.
Insofar as things which stay awhile give order they thereby allow, in their
relationship to each other, reck to belong, in every case, each allowing it
to belong to the other, S1S6vm . . . Kai Tla1v ciAA'IiAols. Only when we have
thought Ta e6VTa as what presences, and this as the totality ofwhat presences
awhile, does ciAA'IiAOIS receive the significance it has in the saying: within the
open region of unconcealment each tarrying thing becomes present to all
the others. A'i long as we fail to think the TCx eovTa, a;\Ai)AoiS remains the
name of some indeterminate reciprocity within a blurred multiplicity. The
more strictly we think, in cXAATJAOIS, the multiplicity of that which stays
awhile, the clearer becomes the necessary relationship of aAA'IiAols to Tia1v.
The more unambiguously this relation emerges, the more clearly we rec­
ognize that the S!S6va1 . . . Tla1v ciAAi)AoiS, each giving reck to the other,
is the manner in which things which stay awhile in presence occupy the
while; that is to say, �i186va1 8iK1lV, giving order. The Kal between SIKllV and
Tla1v is not the vacuous conjunction "and." It signifies, rather, the essential
consequence. When the things that presence give order they do it by, as
things that stay awhile, according each other reck. The surmounting of dis­
order properly occurs through the letting-belong of reck. This means that
in the 6:51Kia, as the essential consequence of dis-order, lies the non-reck
[Un-Ruch], the reckless:

- they let order belong and thereby also reck, one for another (in surmount­
ing) the dis-order.
Letting-belong, as the Kai says, is something twofold. For the essence of the
MVTa is doubly determined. The things which stay awhile come to presence
from out of the jointure between approach and withdrawal. They presence
in the "between" of a twofold absence. They presence in each time of their
while. They presence as the presently present. With a view to their while
they grant reck, and even a while, to the others. But to whom do the things
that presence allow the order of the jointure to belong?
The now-explicated second clause of the saying does not answer this
question. But it gives us a hint. For there remains a word we have overlooked:

ANAXIMANDER'S SAYING

6t66vat yap a(m] . . . , "belonging, namely, they allow . . . " The yap, "for"
or "namely," introduces a grounding. ln any case, the second clause explains
how what is said in the previous clause behaves as it is said.
What does the translated second clause of the saying say? Of the t6VTa,
of that which is present, it says that, as that which stays awhile, it is released
into the reckless dis-order; and it tells how, as so present, it surmounts the
dis-order inasmuch as it allows order and reck to belong one to another. This
letting-belong is the way in which what stays awhile stays, and so presences
as what is present. The second clause of the saying names what presences in
the manner of its presencing. The saying speaks of the presencing of what
is present. It places this in the brilliance of thought. The second clause
provides the explication of the presencing of what is present.
It follows that the first clause must name presencing itself, name it, in­
deed, insofar as it determines that which is present as such. For only to the
extent that it does this can the second clause, in its reference back to the
first, explicate presence via that which presences. Presencing, in relation to
that which is present, is always that according to which the latter presences.
The first clause names that presencing "according to which . . . " Only its
last three words are preserved:

This is translated: "according to necessity." 11:> start with we shall leave To
xpewv untranslated. Yet given the explication of the second clause and the
nature of its reference back to the first, two reflections are in order. First,
that it names the presencing of what is present; second, that if xpewv thinks
the presencing of what is present, then, somehow, the relation of presencing
to what is present is thought; or it may prove otherwise, that the relation of
being to the being, can only come from being, can only rest in the essence
of being.
The word KaTCx precedes To xpewv. It means "down from above" or
"from over there." It refers back to something from which something
lower comes to presence, as from something higher, and as its conse­
quent. That in reference to which the KaTCx is said, contains within itself
an incline [Gefo//e] along which other things have fallen out in this or
that way.
But in which inclination [Gefo//e] and in consequence of what can what
presences be present as such, if not as a consequence and inclination of
presencing? Things that stay awhile stay KaTa TO xpewv. However we are

to think the To xpewv, the word is the earliest name for what is thought as

being of beings to language.
That which stays awhile in presence presences by sunnounting reckless

sibility. The presencing of what presences

is such

a surmounting. This is

accomplished when the things that stay awhile allow order to belong and
thereby reck, one to another. The answer to the question of to whom the
order belongs has been given. It belongs to that within which presencing,
and that means surmounting, presences. Order is

KaTa To xpewv. At this

point the essence of the

xpewv begins to shine, albeit at first from a great
distance. If, as the essence of presencing, TO xpewv is essentially related to
what is present then it must be implicit in this relation that TO xpewv dis­
poses order and with it reck. The xpewv disposes matters so that, within
it, that which is present lets order and reck belong. The xpewv lets such
disposing reach to that which is present and so grants it the manner of its
arrival, the while of its staying awhile.
That which is present presences by surmounting the dis- of disorder,

the

a of aSJKia. This C:nr6 in aSJKia corresponds to the KaTCx of XPEWV. The
transitional yap in the second clause arches over from the one to the other.
So far, we have attempted to think the meaning of To xpewv only via the
reference of the saying's second clause back to it, without asking about the
word itself. What does

To xpewv mean? The first word of the saying's text

we elucidate last because, according to the matter, it is the first. According
to which matter? The matter of the presence of what presences. But to be

The grammatical form of the enigmatically ambiguous genitive names
a genesis, an originc of what is present from out of presencing. Yet, along
with the essence of each of these, the essence of this origin remains hidden.
Not only that, but even the relation between presence and what presences
is still unthought. From earliest times it has seemed as though presence and
what is present are each something for themselves. Unintentionally, pres­
ence itself became something present. Represented in terms of something
present it became that which is above everything else that is present and so

the highest of beings that are present.

As soon as presence is named, it is

already represented as a present being. Fundamentally, presence as such is
not distinguished from what is present. It is taken to be only the most uni­
versal and highest of present beings and hence as one of them. The essence
of presence together with the difference3 between presence and what is
present remains forgotten.

The oblivion of being is oblivion to the difference

between being and the being.
But oblivion to the difference is by no means the result of a forgetfulness
of thinking. Oblivion of being belongs to that essence of being which it itself
conceals. It belongs so essentially to the destiny of being that the dawn of
this destiny begins as the unveiling of what presences in its presence. This
means: the destiny of being begins with oblivion of being so that being,
together with its essence, its difference from the being, keeps to itself. The
difference collapses. It remains forgotten. Though the two elements of the
difference, that which is present and presencing, disclose themselves, they
do not do so

as

different. Rather, even the early traces of the difference

are extinguished through presencing, appearing as something present and
emerging as the highest of beings that are present.
Oblivion to the difference with which the destiny of being begins - so
as to complete itself in such destiny - is not a deficiency. Rather, it is the
richest and broadest event in which the world-history of the West achieves
its resolution. It is the event of metaphysics. What now

is

stands in the

shadow of the destiny of oblivion of being that has already preceded it.
The difference between being and the being, however, can be experi­
enced as something forgotten only if it is unveiled along with the presenc­
ing of what is present; only if it has left a trace, which remains preserved
in the language, to which being comes. Thinking along these lines, we may
sunnise that the difference has shown up more in the earlier than in the
later word of being - though never having been named as such. Ulumina­
tion of the difference, therefore, cannot mean that the difference appears
as the difference. On the contrary, it may be that the relation to what is
present announces itself in presencing as such, in such a way, indeed, that
presencing comes to speak as this relation.
The early word of being, To xpewv, names such a relation. But we would
be deceiving ourselves were we to think that we could locate the difference

and gain access to its essence merely by persisting with etymological dis­
section of the word

xpewv for long enough. Only when we experience his­

torically what has not been thought - oblivion of being - as that which is to
be thought, and only when we have pondered at length what has been long
experienced, may the early word perhaps speak in later recollection.

xpewv is generally translated as "necessity." By that one understands the
compelling, the inescapable "it must be." But it is a mistake to focus ex­

xpewv is derived from xpaw, XPCxOIJOI.
..; xelp, the hand. xpaw means: I handle something, reach for
it, extend my hand to it. Thus, at the same time, xpaw means: to place

clusively on this secondary meaning.
This suggests

in someone's hands, to hand over and deliver, to let something belong to
someone. Such a delivery is, however, of a kind which keeps the transfer in
hand, and with it what is transferred.
Originally, therefore, the participial contains nothing of compulsion or
"must." Just a little, however, does the word

xpewv - originally or ever ­

denote ratification or ordering.
If we attend fully to the fact that the word must be thought from within
Anaximander's saying, then it can only name what is essential in the pres­
encing of what is present, together with the relation which is announced
- darkly enough - in the genitive.

To xpewv is thus the handing over of

presencing, a handing over which hands out presencing to what is present,
and therefore keeps in hand, in other words, preserves in presencing, what
is present as such.
The relation to what is present that prevails in the essence of presencing is
unique. It is comparable with no other relation. It belongs to the uniqueness
of being itself. In order to name the essence of being, therefore, language
would have to find something unique, the unique word. From this one can
gather how daring is every thoughtful word that is addressed to being. Such
daring is, nonetheless, not impossible since, in the most diverse ways, being
speaks everywhere and always, in every language. The difficulty lies less in
the discovery, in thought, of being's word than in preserving the purity of
the discovered word in authentic thinking.

To xpewv. We venture a translation which sounds
strange and can easily be misunderstood: TO xpewv usage [Brauch].
Anaximander says:

In this translation we attribute to the Greek word a meaning that is
neither foreign to the word itself nor contrary to the matter discussed in
the saying. Nonetheless, the translation makes strenuous demands. Even
if we bear in mind that all translation in the field of thought makes such
demands, it does not hide this character.

Al\:AX IMAND E R 'S SAYING

lo what extent is

TO xpewv usage? The strangeness of the translation is

ameliorated by thinking our word more clearly. Generally, we understand
"to use" to mean to utilize and need within the area of that to the use
of which we enjoy a right.

As the translation of TO xpewv, "usage" is not

to be understood in these customary but secondary meanings. Rather, we
attend to the root meaning: to use is

bruchen

(to brook3], in Latin frui, in

Ge rman fruchten,
enjoy

Fmcht [to bear fruit, fruit]. We translate this freely as "to
[geniessen]" which, in its original fonn [niessen], means to take joy in

something and so to have it in use. Only in its secondary meaning docs "to
enjoy" come to mean to consume and gobble up. We encounter what we
have called the root meaning of "to use" asfmi when Augustine says

"Quid
eni111 est aliud quod dicimus frui, nisi praesto habere, quod diligis?"4 (De moribus
eccksiae, lib. I c. 3; cf. De doctrino christia11a, lib. I, c. 2-4). Frui contains:
praesto habere. Praesto, prnesitum means in Greek \rrroKEiiJevov, that which
already lies before us in unconccalment, the

ovaia, that which presences

awhile. Accordingly, "to use" says: to let something that is present come
to presence as such.

Fr11i, bruchen [to brook], to use, usage,

means: to hand

something over to its own essence and, as so present, to keep it in the
protecting hand.

In the translation of To xpewv, usage is thought of as essential presencing

in being itself.

Bruchen

[to brook] , fmi, is now no longer predicated of

enjoyment as human behavior; nor is it said in relation to any being whatever,
even the highest

(fi1titio Dei as the beotitudo hominis).

Rather, "usage" now

designates the way in which being itself presences as the relationship to what
is present which is concerned and handles it as what is present:

TO xpewv.

Usage hands over what is present to its presencing; to, that is, its while.
Usage imparts to it the portion of its while. The while, apportioned in each
case to what stays, rests in the jointure which disposes what presences in the
passage between the two absences (arrival and departure). The jointure of
the while confines and bounds what presences as such a thing. That which
presences awhile,

TO e6VTa, presences within its boundary (nepas).

A'i the apportioning of participation in the jointure, usage is the destining
decree: the disposal oforder and thereby reck. Use hands out order and reck
by, in advance, reserving to itself what is handed out, gathering it into itself,
and sheltering it as what is present in presencing.
Usage, however, disposing order and so containing that which pres­
ences, hands out boundaries.

As TO xpet.:>v, therefore, it is at the same time

TO C'nre1pov, that which is without boundaries since its essence consists in
sending the boundary of the while to that which presences awhile.

277

OFF THE B EATEN TRACK

According to the tradition reported in Simplicius' commentary on
Aristotle's Pbysics, Anaximander is supposed to have said that that which
presences has its essential origin in that which presences without bounds:
apxiJ T(;)V OVTWV TO cnmpov. What is without bounds is not disposed
by order and reck. It is not one of the things that are present but rather
To xpeoov.
Disposing order and reck, usage releases the present being and delivers
each to its while. By doing so, however, it places it in permanent danger
that its tarrying in the while will petri fy into mere persistence. Thus, at the
same time, usage hands presencing over into dis-order. Usage conjoins the
"dis-."
For this reason what stays awhile in presence can come to presence only
insofar as it allows order and reck to belong: to usage. What presences
always presences KCXTCx TO xpeoov, within the lines of usage. lJsage is the
disposing and preserving gathering of what presences always in to its tarrying
presence.
The translation of To xpeoov as "usage" is not based on etymological or
lexical considerations. The choice of the word is based, rather, on a prior
translation of thought which tries to think the difference within the essence
of being, in the destining beginning of oblivion of being. "Usage" is dictated
to thinking in the experience of oblivion of being. A trace of what properly
remains to be thought in the word "usage" is presumably to be found in To
xpeoov. This trace quickly vanishes in the destining of being which unfolds
in world-history as Western metaphysics.
Thinking what presences in its presence, Anaximander's saying expli­
cates that which is named by To xpeoov. What is thought as xpeoov in the
saying is the first and highest thoughtful interpretation of what the Greeks
experienced under the designation Moipa, as the allonnent of lots. Both
gods and men are subordinate to Moipa. To xpeoov, usage, is the hand­
ing in and handing over of everything that presences, each to its while in
unconcealment.
To xpeoov harbours within it the still-hidden essence of the lighting­
sheltering gathering. Usage is gathering: 6 /\6yor;. Out of the essence of
the /\6yor;, thought in this way, the essence of being is determined as the
unifying One: "Ev. Pannenides thinks this same "Ev. He thinks the unity
of this unifying One explicitly as Moipa (Fragment 8 in Diels, Fragmente
der Vorsol.:ratiker). Thought out of the essential experience of being, Moipa
corresponds to the /\6yor; of Heraclitus. The essence of Moipa and /\6yor;
is thoughtfully prefigured in Anaximander's Xpeoov.

ANAXIMAl':DER'S SAYING

To hunt for dependencies and influences between thinkers is a misun­
derstanding of thought. What every thinker is dependent on is the address
of being. The extent of this dependence determines the freedom from ir­
relevant influences. The broader the dependence the more capacious the
freedom of thought; and therefore the danger that it will wander past what
was once thought only, perhaps, to think the same.
We latecomers, admittedly, must, in recollection, first have thought
Anaximander's saying in order to meditate on the thought of Parmenides
and Heraclitus. If we have done so, then the view that the philosophy of the
one is a doctrine of being, the other a doctrine of becoming is exposed as a
misunderstanding.
But to think Anaximander's saying we must first of all - but then again
and again - take the simple step by means of which we cross over to what
that always unspoken word

t6v, t6vra, eTva1 says. It says: presencing in

unconcealment. Still concealed in the word is this: presencing itself brings
tmcrmcealmentwith it. Unconcealment itselfis presencing. They arc the same,
though not identical.
What is present is that which, presently and unpresently, presence.'i
in unconcealment. Along with
being, the

'AA1')6e1a, which belongs to the essence of

J\T,611 remains completely unthought and, as a consequence,

"presently" and "un-presently" as well; that is to say, the area of the
open region within which every being that presences arrives and in
which the presencing-to-one-another of beings that stay is unfolded and
delimited.
Since the being is that which, having arrived in unconcealment, pres­
ences in the manner of staying awhile, it

can

-

lingering there - appear.

Appearance is an essential consequence of presencing and of its nature.
Only what appears - thinking this always from within presencing - shows
visage and aspect. Only thinking which, from the beginning, has thought
being in the sense of presencing in unconcealment can think the presenc­
ing of what presences as

IS�a. Yet what stays awhile in presences stays at

tl1e same time as that which is brought forth into unconcealment. It is so
brought forth when, arising out of i tself, it brings itself forth. Or it is so

In both cases what comes forth
a certain sense, an epyov, thought in the Greek

brought forth when it is pro-duced by man.
into unconcealment is, in

manner: something brought forth. The prcsencing of what presences, its

epyov character thought in the light of presence, can be experienced as
that which presences in brought-forth-ness. This is the presencing of what
presencc.'i. The being of the being- is

evepye1a.

2 79

OFF TilE BEATEN TRACK

This evepye1a which Aristotle thinks as the fundamental character of pres­
encing, of e6v, the

15ea which Plato thinks as the fundamental character of
presencing, the A6yos which Heraclitus thinks as the fundamental charac­
ter of presencing, the Moipa which Parmenides thinks as the fundamental
character of presencing, the Xpeoov which Anaximander thinks as what is
essential in presencing, all name the same. In the concealed richness of the
same lies the unity of the unifying One, the "Ev which, in his own way, is
thought by every thinker.
Meanwhile, an epoch of being soon arrives in which
into

actualitas.

evepye1a is translated

The Greek is shut away and appears, right up to our own

times, only in its Roman guise.

Actualitas becomes reality. Reality becomes

objectivity. But even this, in order to remain in its essence as objectivity,
requires the character of presencing. It is the "presence" in the represen­
tation of representing. The decisive

ntm

[We11de]

in the destiny of being as

evepyela is the transition to actualitas.
Could a mere translation have caused all this? But perhaps we have
learned to consider what can happen in translation. The truly destining
encounter of historical languages is a silent event. But in it the destining of
being speaks. Into what language is the land of the evening tra11slated?
We will now try to translate Anaximander's saying:

. . . along the line of usage; for they let order and reck belong to one another (in the
surmounting) of dis-order.

This translation cannot be scientifically established: nor should we have
faith in it on the basis of some kind of authority. Scientific proof will not
take us far enough. Faith has no place in thought. We can only reflect on
the translation by thinking through the saying. Thinking, however, is the
poeticizing of the truth of being in the historical dialogue between those
who think.
For this reason the saying will never speak to

us

so long as we explain

it in a merely historical and philological manner. Strangely enough, the
saying first speaks to us when we lay aside the claims of our usual mode of
representing, as we ask ourselves in what the confusion of today's world­
destiny consists.
Man is about to hurl himself upon the entire earth and its atmosphere, to
arrogate to himself the hidden working of nature in the form of energy, and
to subordinate the course of history to the plans and orderings of a world

is;

of saying what this is, that a thing is.
The totality of beings is the single object of a singular will to conquer.
The simplicity of being is buried under a singular oblivion.
What mortal can fathom the abyss of this confusion? In the face of this
abyss one can try to shut one's eyes. One can erect one illusion after another.
The abyss does not retreat.
Theories of nature, doctrines about history, do not remove the confu­
sion. They further confuse things until they arc unrecognizable, since they
themselves are nourished by the confusion which surrounds the difference
between beings and being.
Is there any rescue? It comes first and only when the danger

But what if being, in its essence, needs to use [lmmcht] the essence of man?

Phenomenology ofMind. It has been lighdy revised here, mainly to be made more
literal in those instances where greater literalness is important in Heidegger's
analysis.

"The Origin of the Work ofArt. " The first version represents the contents of a lecture
delivered on the �ovember 1 3, I935 to the Art-Historical Society ofFreiburg in
Breisgau, and repeated in January I 936 in Ziirich, at the invitation of the student
body of the University. The present version consists of three lectures delivered
on November 1 7, ::\lovember 24-o and December 4, 1936 in the Freies Deutsches
Hochstift of Frankfurt on the Main. The Epilogue was written some time later.
The Appendix was written in I956 and first appeared in the special edition of
the essay that appeared in Reclam's Univerrni-Bibliotbek in I 96o. The text of the
essay prc.�ented here has been lightly reworked and, as with the last version of the
Reclam edition, has been more extensively divided into paragraphs.

"Tbe Agt ofthe World Picmre." The lecture was delivered on june 9, I938 under the
title "The Founding of the Modern World Picture by Metaphysics." It was the
last of a series of lectures on the foundations of the world picture of modernity,
organized by the art-historical, scientific, and medical societies of Freiburg. The
Appendices were written at the same time but not delivered.

"Hegel's C011cept ofExperience." The contents of the essay were delivered in a form
more suited to the classroom in seminars on Hegel's Tbe Phenqmmolop;y ofSpirit
and Aristotle's Metaphysics (Books IV and IX) during I 942/3, and during the same
period presented in two lectures before a smaller audience.

"Nietzsche's Word: 'God Is Dead.' " The main part of this was repeated several times
before small audiences in I 943· The contents are based on the Niet7.sche lectures
delivered over five semesters between 1 9 36 and I 940 at the University ofFreiburg.
They undertake the task of grasping Nietzsche's thought as the completion of
Western metaphysics from out of the history of being. The passages quoted from
Niet"1..�che's works follow the large octavo edition.

"U'lry Poets?" The lecture was delivered to a small audience to commemorate the
twentieth anniversary of the death ofR. M. Rilke (he died on December 29, 1 926).
On the question of the text see the work of Ernst Zinn in l!.uphorion, new series,

Editor's epilogue to the seventh edition
of Holzwege

I

(198o) of Holzu,ege, the improved text from the Col­
lected W01-ks (volwne V) was used for the first time; however, it dropped

For the sixth edition

the marginalia which Heidegger wrote in his own copies of the text and
which were printed in the

Collected W01·ks as footnotes. The seventh edition

presented here now also includes these marginalia; thus in all subsequent
printings, this edition will be identical in respect to both word and page
number with volume V of the

Collected Works.

Since the sixth edition, the text of the essay "The Origin of the Art­
work" is the version which I Ieidegger revised for its separate publication

U11iversai-Bibliothek i n 1 960. In comparison with the version
printed previously in Holzwege, various passages have been lightly reworked,

in Reclam's

it has been more extensively divided into paragraphs, and it has been en­
larged through the addition of an appendix written in 1 956.
This edition takes its text from the new edition ofHolzwege in the Collected

Wurks and therefore also incorporates a few stylistic and clarifying correc­
tions marked by Heidegger in his own copies of the work. Since they are
concerned merely with polishing the style, their character is distinct from
that of the marginal comments abottt particular passages. Even the way that
Heidegger made use of proof correction marks to distinguish them makes
them stand in contrast to the marginal comments. According to Heidegger's
instmctions, such corrections in the text are not to be explicitly indicated.
For the publication of llolzwege in the Collected Wo1·ks a few obvious errors
by I Ieidegger in spelling and punctuation were silently corrected.

II

The printing of the marginalia from Heidegger�'i own copies requires a few
explanations. The small superscript letters introduced in the text refer to

ED ITOR'S EPILOGUE TO TilE S F.VF.::'\TH EDITION OF 1-IOf.'L.WEGE

the marginalia reproduced in the footnotes.

In Heidegger's copies, we find

marginal comments either on the margins of the pages or, if it is a copy
with blank pages inserted for corrections, also on the pages designed for
that purpose. The words in the text to which the editor assigned a small
superscript letter were chosen in accordance with the reference marks the
author himself set down or, when these were lacking, from the sense of the
context.
There is a working copy of the first edition of

Holzwege

( 1 950).

"Messkirch working copy" is written in handwriting on the endpaper. For
the essay "The Origin of the Artwork," there is in addition a separate copy
from the third edition of llolzwege ( 1 957) and two copies of its special pub­
lication in Reclam's

U11iversa/-Bibliothek ( 1 960), of which the one most used

had been printed with blank pages interleaved within the text. From that
copy the greatest number of marginal comments have been taken. Martin
Heidegger had specifically emphasized their importance to the editor.
The compilation of the marginalia was prepared by the editor in accor­
dance with the guidelines given by the author. These obligated him to make
a selection of the handwritten remarks that was as concise as possible, aim­
ing only at the essential. Moreover, despite their brevity they had to be clear
to readers. A marginal comment is essential and communicable to a reader
when it has the character of a substantive note on a passage that is suited to
advance the reader's comprehension. ln this sense, there are three respects
in which marginal notes are essential: first, they can be a clarification of a
passage that remains on the same level of reflection as the passage; second,
we encounter self-critical remarks that belong to a level of reflection that
has altered; third, we meet with entries in which the substantial relation
between a key word from a later period and an earlier thought is indicated.
The character of the marginalia and the circumstances in which they were
composed prevent the marginal comments from being dated securely and
unambiguously. With few exceptions, they were not developed as, for ex­
ample, appendices or self-contained short texts; rather, they often emerged
only as isolated bits in the course of repeated readings and consultations. In
most cases it is a matter of chance fragments of thought that were recorded
hastily. It is obvious that such notes in the course of reading and re-reading
cannot be dated like texts which an author has prepared.
The dates of the editions used as working copies, given in the footnotes
before each marginal comment, provide an aid for orienting oneself toward
a rough dating. The marginalia selected from the Messkirch copy were
written between 1 950 and 1 976. The marginal comments to the essay "The

2 88

E DITOR'S EPILOGUE TO T H E S EVENTH E DITIO� OF f/OI.ZWIIGE

Origin of the Artwork" derived from both working copies of the Reclam
edition, were composed in the period between 1 960 and 1 976.
However, there is no point in dating the marginalia if we are occupied
with it for its own sake and not, rather, in the interest of thoughtfully map­
ping out the different stations that Martin Heidegger occupied along the
path of this thinking. Those who have read Heidegger's works carefully and
repeatedly will know them'iclves to be in a position to relate the marginal
comments, on the basis of their intellectual content and style, to an earlier
or later stage of Heidegger's path.
Because the marginalia were written as notes in the course of reading
over a long period of time, beginning with the year of publication of each
edition that was used as a working copy and often continuing through later
editions, they must not be taken as a whole to constitute the author's final
word on his writings. This is especially true with the remarks that belong
to a level of reflection of a stage that has already been traversed. However,
to say this is not to foster the opinion that only the marginalia from the
philosopher's last stage are of interest, as though he abandoned the ones
that had led the way. He did not seek out a new stage because the previous
one proved to he false, but rather because the same matter for thinking
revealed itself to him in a way that had been transformed. Each one of these
way stations gives proof of its truth in the fact that it granted a questioning
step in asking a question of being. Just as we may not renounce the writing
from an earlier stage, so too the marginal comments that stem from an
earlier level of reflection retain their own weight.
