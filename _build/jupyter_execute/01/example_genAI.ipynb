      "- A container of blueberries\n",
      "- 2 avocados\n",

      "- Butter (for toasting buns)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper\n",
      "- Cheese (not visible in the photo, but a common ingredient in burgers)\n",
      "- Oil for cooking\n",
      "- Any other preferred seasonings (like the thyme seen here)\n",

      "   - Top with onion, pickles, and shredded carrots if desired.\n",
