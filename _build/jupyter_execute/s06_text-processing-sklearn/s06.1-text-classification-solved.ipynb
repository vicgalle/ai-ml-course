    "## Applications of text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Many business problems can be framed as text classification problems, specially those involving customer or user feedback.\n",
    "The commond ground is that for all these applications, the input is just raw text (in a language such as English), so it can be challenging to apply machine learning to solve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two examples.\n",

    "### Sentiment Analysis üòç/üò°\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves the use of machine learning, statistics, and natural language understanding to identify, extract and study affective states and subjective information from source materials. Typically, it is a supervised task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's usually applied to text data to help **businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback**, and understand customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis can be broadly categorized into document level, sentence level, and aspect level analysis. It can detect subjective information such as opinions, beliefs, evaluations, appraisals, and emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The challenges faced in sentiment analysis include **understanding the context, detecting sarcasm, and handling ambiguous sentences** that could have multiple meanings. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Feature processing is the process of transforming text into a more digestible form so that it can be easily consumed by machine learning algorithms. There are usually two phases in text processing: tokenization and vectorization.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: the process of splitting a text into smaller units called tokens. It is the first step in text processing. The tokens could be words, sentences, or even characters. The tokens are then used as the basic building blocks for any NLP task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Vectorization**: the process of converting text into numerical representations called vectors. It is the second step in text processing. The vectors are then used as input to machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "In scikit-learn, the `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` classes are used for both tokenization and vectorization.\n",
    "\n",

He left a voicemail stating that I better be available between XXXX tomorrow and that he would be going to my place of employment first and if I was not there would be speaking with my supervisor to find out when my next shift would be. He also indicated that he would then proceed to go to the homes of family and friends to locate me. He stated that I would need two forms of ID and a witness to sign for these documents. At the end of the voicemail he provided me with a phone number for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and a \" case number ''. Upon calling XXXX XXXX XXXX with this information I spoke with XXXX who informed me that they were a mediation firm working on behalf of Fifth Third Bank. He stated that Fifth Third had found me to have committed fraud for my own personal gain and that they were moving forward with court proceedings at which time I would owe {$810.00}. I explained to him that I currently have an account with Fifth Third Bank and was curious as to why they had not contacted me about this old bank account. He stated that they contracted with them for mediation on it and that it had been in default with them since XX/XX/XXXX. I asked him what the amount would be if I paid today. He placed me on hold for 10 minutes and then came back to the phone and stated I could make a payment arrangement for 3 payments of {$180.00} or I could settle for a one time payment of {$270.00}. I advised him that I would settle but that I needed confirmation that the date was settled and advised him that he needed to contact this \" private courier '' company to notify them because I did not want them showing up at my job, my house, or the home of my friends and/or family. He agreed to email me this notification which I have attached to this complaint. As soon as I got off the phone I contacted Fifth Third Bank to let them know about my experience. The representative that I spoke with stated that they wouldn't have any information about the account since they sold it to a debt collector. I told her I was very upset and ready to cancel my current accounts with them because of this to which she replied \" Well that doesn't have anything to do with Fifth Third. '' I told her of course it does, you sold the debt to this company and they contacted me with threats. I called the FTC to file a complaint about this private courier for XXXX XXXX  XXXX and gave them the phone number I received the call from, however when you call the number it states to email any inquiries to them at their website and conveniently does not give you a website. I called XXXX back at XXXX XXXX  XXXX and attempted several times to get the information for this \" private courier '' but he refused stating that they did not have this information. I explained that I intended to make a complaint with the FTC about this company and I needed their contact information. He continued to refuse and stated that they don't work directly with them but that he could report it back to the attorney. I then asked for the attorney 's contact information so that I could get the information myself, he refused to provide me with that as well. I informed him that since he was not willing to provide me with this information that I would be filing a complaint with consumerfinance.gov and his response was \" Well if that's what you feel you have to do.

       "2885  On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX EST I received a threatening phone call from someone who claimed they were with a \" local courier '' by the name of XXXX XXXX. He left a voicemail stating that I better be available between XXXX tomorrow and that he would be going to my place of employment first and if I was not there would be speaking with my supervisor to find out when my next shift would be. He also indicated that he would then proceed to go to the homes of family and friends to locate me. He stated that I would need two forms of ID and a witness to sign for these documents. At the end of the voicemail he provided me with a phone number for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and a \" case number ''. Upon calling XXXX XXXX XXXX with this information I spoke with XXXX who informed me that they were a mediation firm working on behalf of Fifth Third Bank. He stated that Fifth Third had found me to have committed fraud for my own personal gain and that they were moving forward with court proceedings at which time I would owe {$810.00}. I explained to him that I currently have an account with Fifth Third Bank and was curious as to why they had not contacted me about this old bank account. He stated that they contracted with them for mediation on it and that it had been in default with them since XX/XX/XXXX. I asked him what the amount would be if I paid today. He placed me on hold for 10 minutes and then came back to the phone and stated I could make a payment arrangement for 3 payments of {$180.00} or I could settle for a one time payment of {$270.00}. I advised him that I would settle but that I needed confirmation that the date was settled and advised him that he needed to contact this \" private courier '' company to notify them because I did not want them showing up at my job, my house, or the home of my friends and/or family. He agreed to email me this notification which I have attached to this complaint. As soon as I got off the phone I contacted Fifth Third Bank to let them know about my experience. The representative that I spoke with stated that they wouldn't have any information about the account since they sold it to a debt collector. I told her I was very upset and ready to cancel my current accounts with them because of this to which she replied \" Well that doesn't have anything to do with Fifth Third. '' I told her of course it does, you sold the debt to this company and they contacted me with threats. I called the FTC to file a complaint about this private courier for XXXX XXXX  XXXX and gave them the phone number I received the call from, however when you call the number it states to email any inquiries to them at their website and conveniently does not give you a website. I called XXXX back at XXXX XXXX  XXXX and attempted several times to get the information for this \" private courier '' but he refused stating that they did not have this information. I explained that I intended to make a complaint with the FTC about this company and I needed their contact information. He continued to refuse and stated that they don't work directly with them but that he could report it back to the attorney. I then asked for the attorney 's contact information so that I could get the information myself, he refused to provide me with that as well. I informed him that since he was not willing to provide me with this information that I would be filing a complaint with consumerfinance.gov and his response was \" Well if that's what you feel you have to do.

       "3655  I enrolled in XXXX for XXXX term in 2010. I was told by the financial aid counselor at the time that I could use federal student aid to cover the cost of class. After classes began there was a delay in processing my student aid and so my student account was placed in negative status. After continued contact between myself and my counselor I was able to correct the issue and the money was dispersed to the University. It was at this time I was told they would not be able to use federal funds, and that I would have to cover the costs out of pocket. This after the term was actually over and I received a final grade for the course. After informing them I would be unable to as I was unemployed at the time, which was the reason for using federal aid in the first place, I was told that if I did not the account would be placed in collections and reflected in my credit report. This has been the case ever since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Today I was finally told it would not be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "b'truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey\\'s character in this film . \\npresident truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . \\n \" truman \" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . \\nand burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . \\nif hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv\\'s world , the world where our protagonist lives . \\ncombine all these names and concepts into \" truman burbank , \" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . \\ntruman leads the perfect life . \\nhis town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . \\nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . \\nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . \\n . \\n . \\nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? \\nthe next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . \\nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . \\nwhen the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . \\nhis suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . \\nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . \\nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . \\na grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . \\ntwo security guards grab him and throw him out . \\ntruman is really suspicious now . \\nit gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . \\n \" it\\'s best not to think about it , \" she says , trying vainly to change truman\\'s memory . \\ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . \\nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . \\nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \\nyou know by now that truman\\'s life is the subject of a television program . \\nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \\ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \\nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman\\'s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \\nit\\'s sort of like westworld told from the robots\\' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs\\' point of view . \\nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \\nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \\nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \\nalthough these questions came to mind , i don\\'t think the film itself asked them . \\nit certainly didn\\'t address them or try to answer them . \\ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn\\'t deal more with the trauma of learning one\\'s life is a tv show . \\ncarrey\\'s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman\\'s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film\\'s pacing . \\nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \\nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn\\'t see it that way . \\nperhaps it\\'s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn\\'t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \\nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \\nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \\nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \\nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \\none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \\nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \\nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman\\'s world is still beautiful and perfect . \\nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \\nphilip glass\\' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman\\'s scenes of suspicion and awakening . \\n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \\nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \\nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \\none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman\\'s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn\\'t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \\nthere\\'s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \\nit\\'s a quick , straight shot to the movie\\'s end . \\nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol\\'s gattaca . \\nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \\nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \\nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol\\'s next film , whatever it may be . \\n'"
