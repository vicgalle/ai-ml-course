TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

There are many reasons that Being and

Time poses special problems for

its translator and for the readers of an English language translation.
Three aspects of the text are especially noteworthy and so need to be
commented upon here. First, one needs to bear in mind that, in

and Time,

Being

Heidegger has introduced a large number of German neolo­

gisms. Words such as

Befindlichkeit,

which are readily intelligible to a

German reader since it has a clear relation to an everyday German
phrase

(wie befinden Sie sich?-"How

are you doing?"), appear here as

Heidegger's own coinage and so pose a challenge even to a German
reader. Typically, Heidegger's neologisms have strong connections to
everyday phrases or words, and so exhibit a curious mix of strangeness
and familiarity. Second, Heidegger frequently employs quite common
vocabulary in uncommon ways. Here the most visible example is his
use of the word

Dasein which,

besides having a long history as a philo­

sophic term (it is, for example, one of the categories in Hegel's Science of

Logic),

is a word that belongs to everyday conversation. One of Heideg­

ger's intentions in

Being and Time

is to re-appropriate that word and

give it new meaning without completely repudiating its everyday sense.
Again, a German reader might find a sort of alchemy of familiarity and
strangeness in Heidegger's use of such words. Third, naturally one finds
Heidegger using quite traditional philosophical vocabulary in Being and

Time,

but he goes to great lengths to move such words into new and

rather untraditional senses. Words such as

Wahrheit

("truth") and

Sein

("being") are only the most obvious examples of the problem a trans la­
tor and reader face .
Such are some o f th e sorts o f translation problems that are espe­
cially amplified by the nature of this text. There remain of course the

xiv

Being and Time

usual problems that belong to the project of translating German into
English. But these problems, while demanding a certain vigilance on
the part of both the translator and the reader, are not insurmountable.
Some three decades ago Macquarri e and Robinson published a transla­
tion of Being and

Time and in so

doing were at the forefront of bringing

Heidegger's work into English. That trans lation itself came to shape the
way in which Heidegger's work was discussed in English. After three
decades of translations of Heidegger's other works by a variety of some
of the decisions that were made in that early translation of

Time might now need

Being and

to be reconsidered.

The present translation attempts to take into account the insights
of the past thirty years of Heidegger scholarship in English. This trans­
lation was begun some time ago and has undergone changes over the
years as colleagues have offered suggestions. Some individual transla­
tions will no doubt still provoke controversy and, because Heidegger's
language is so rich and multivalent, would likely do so no matter how
they were translated. But it is hoped that this translation will remedy
some of the infelicities and errors of the previous translation, and open
a productive debate about some of the more original and still puzzling
language of this text. To that end, a few very brief remarks about some
of the terminology decisions may be in order to help orient the reader to
some of the choices made here and to some of the alternative transla­
tions that might well be borne in mind by the reader. However, in the
end, the translation will need to justify itself in the reading.
It was Heidegger's express wish that in future translations the
word Da-sein should be hyphenated throughout Being and
tice he himself instigated, for example, in chapter

5

Time,

a prac­

of Division One.

Thus the reader will be less prone to assume he or she understands it to
refer to "existence" (which is the orthodox translation of Dasein) and
with that translation surreptitiously bring along all sorts of psychological
connotations. It was Heidegger's insight that human being is

uncanny:

we do not know who, or what, that is, although, or perhaps precisely
because, we

are it.

As is the case with German nouns in general, the terms Da-sein and

Ang.st, which remain untranslated, retain capitalization:

no other English

expressions are capitalized, including the term "being." Capitalizing
"being," although it has the dubious merit of treating "being" as some­
thing unique, risks implying that it is some kind of Super Thing or tran­
scendent being. But Heidegger's use of the word "being" in no sense
refers the word to something like

a being,

especially not a transcendent

Being. Heidegger does not want to substantivize this word, yet capitaliz­
ing the word in English does tend to imply just that. The later words for
being,

Ereignis,

("appropriation," "belonging-together") and

Das Geviert

Translator's Preface

xv

("the Fowfold") express relations that ftrst constitute any possible relata or
things, and thus confirm this nonsubstantializing intention.
Another peculiarly problematic word is

Veifallen which does not lit­

erally mean "falling," but speaks rather of a "falling prey" to something
(the world). In other words, it is a kind of "motion" that is unable to go
anywhere. While one might render the substantive

Verfallenheit)

(das Veifallen /die

as "ensnarement," I choose to translate it as "entangle­

ment" to avoid the connotation of a trap.
The word

Beftndlichkeit,

which I have translated as "attunement,"

needs some qualification and special comment. Another legitimate trans­
lation for this word is "disposition" (here one could refer to the French
translation which uses

disposition).

But despite quite compelling reasons

to use "disposition," I decided that "attunement" was the better choice if
only because it seems better able to avoid suggesting that there are psy­
chological connotations carried in Heidegger's analysis of Beftndlichkeit.
The translation of the word

Bewandtnis

here as "relevance" also

needs a comment. While one might opt for a different translation,
namely "situation," it seems that such a choice leaves the meaning of the
word too broad and vague, and that it fails to capture the distinction
Heidegger makes between
things, and

Situation,

Bewandtnis,

which has primarily to do with

which is more applicable to people.

The crucial trio of words

Sorge, Besorgen,

and

Filrsorge

was ren­

dered as "care," "taking care," and "concern," respectively. A shift from
the previous translation of Being and

Time needs to be noted here. Mac­
besorgen;

quarrie and Robinson had used "concern" as a translation for

however, I have chosen to use the word "concern" as a translation for

Filrsorge,

which involves human issues. I have translated

besorgen as "tak­

ing care" {as opposed to the Macquarrie and Robinson translation of
"solicitude") because it refers more to errands and matters that one
takes care of or settles.
Heidegger sometimes uses the word

Andere),

Andere

with an article

(die

but for the most part the word appears without an article. I

have followed him in this and so use "others" rather than "the others."
The emphasis on the other(s), so strongly expressed in Sartre as a threat
to subjectivity, is lacking in Heidegger. Mter all, we belong to others; we
are others too.

Vorlaufen.

Anticipation is perhaps too weak. Macquarrie and

Robinson's "running forward in thought" seemed a bit awkward. But it
may be the better choice.

Niihe

was consistently rendered as "nearness," whereas in earlier

versions I often used "closeness" as well.
The word

Wiederholung,

which I have translated as "retrieval,"

could also be translated as "recapitulation" since that word is used in

xvi

Being and Time

music to refer to what Heidegger seems to intend by

Wiederholung.

In

music (specifically in the sonata form) recapitulation refers to the return
of the initial theme after the whole development section. Because of its
new place in the piece, that same theme is now heard differently.
One final word, which is a departure from the previous trans lation,
needs to be noted.

Augenblick,

which I have translated

as

"moment" (as

opposed to Macquarrie and Robinson's "moment of vision"), should
help pick up the temporal connotations of the word and also shed some
of the almost mystical sense of the previous translation. Here the reader
might do well to associate the word with the English expression "in the
twinkling of an eye" or the French

coup d'oeil.

The nonnumerical notes at the bottom of the pages are Heideg­
ger's own notes made in the margin on the occasion of subsequent re­
readings.
I wish to thank Dennis Schmidt for his valuable and helpful sug­
gestions. I also wish to thank the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung for
its generous support enabling me to complete this translation.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE
SEVENTH GERMAN EDITION

The text of Being and Time first appeared in the spring of 1927 in the
Jahrbuch filr Phiinomenologie und phiinomenologische Forschung, Vol. VIII,
and it was published simultaneously as a separate volume.
The present reprint, which is the seventh edition, is unchanged
with respect to the text, but has been newly revised with regard to quo­
tations and punctuation. The page numbers of this reprint agree with
those of the earlier editions except for minor deviations.
The designation "First Half," which previous editions bore, has
been deleted. Mter a quarter century, the second half could no longer
be added without the first being presented anew. Nonetheless, its path
still remains a necessary one even today, if the question of being is to
move our Da-sein.
For the elucidation of that question the reader may refer to my

Einfilhrung in die Metaphysik which is being published by the same press
as this text. That work presents the text of a lecture course delivered in
the summer semester of

1935.

.l'or manifestly you have long been aware of what
you mean when you use the expression 'being.' We,
however, who used to think we understood it, have now
become perplexed.
Do we in our time have an answer to the ques­
tion of what we really mean by the word 'being'? Not at
all. So it is fitting that we should raise anew the question
of the meaning of being. But are we nowadays even per­
plexed at our inability to understand the expression
'being'? Not at all. So first of all we must reawaken an
understanding for the meaning of this question. Our
aim in the following treatise is to work out the question
of the meaning of being and to do so concretely. Our
provisional aim is the interpretation of time as the pos­
sible horizon for any understanding whatsoever of
being.
But the reasons for making this our aim, the
investigations which such a purpose requires, and the
path to its achievement, call for some introductory
remarks.

INTRODUCTION
The Exposition of the Question
of the Meaning of Being

I
The Necessity, Structure, and
Priority of the Question of Being

1. The Necessi ty of an Explicit Retrieve of the Question of Being
This question has today been forgotten-although our time considers
itself progressive in again affirming "metaphysics." All the same we
believe that we are spared the exertion of rekindling a

peri t'es ousias

gigantomachia
Sophist

["a Battle of Giants concerning Being," Plato,

245e6-246el]. But the question touched upon here is hardly an arbi­
trary one. It sustained the avid research of Plato and Aristotle but from
then on ceased to be heard

as a thematic question of actual investigation.

What these two thinkers achieved has been preserved in various dis­
torted and "camouflaged" forms down to Hegel's Logic. And what then
was wrested from phenomena by the highest exertion of thought, albeit

in fragments and first beginnings, has long since been trivialized.
Not only that. On the foundation of the Greek point of departure
for the interpretation of being a dogma has taken shape which not only
declares that the question of the meaning of being is superfluous but
sanctions its neglect. It is said that "being" is the most universal and
the emptiest concept. As such it resists every attempt at definition. Nor
does this most universal and thus indefinable concept need any defini­
tion. Everybody uses it constantly and also already understands what is
meant by it. Thus what troubled ancient philosophizing and kept it so by
virtue of its obscurity has become obvious, clear as day, such that who­
ever persists in asking about it is accused of an error of method.

2

Being and

Int. 1

Time

At the beginning of this inquiry the prejudices that constantly
instill and repeatedly promote the idea that a questioning of being is not

3

needed cannot be discussed in detail. They are rooted in ancient ontol­
ogy itself. That ontology can in tum only be interpreted adequately
under the guidance of the question of being which has been clarified
and answered beforehand. One must proceed with regard to the soil
from which the fundamental ontological concepts grew and with refer­
ence to the suitable demonstration of the categories and their com­
pleteness. We therefore wish to discuss these prejudices only to the
extent that the necessity of a retrieve of the question of the meaning of
being becomes evident. There are three such prejudices.

1 . "Being"* is the most "universal" concept: to on esti katholou malista
panton.1 Illud quod primo cadit sub apprehensione est ens, cuiu.s intellectu.s
includitur in omnibu.s, quaecumque quis apprehendit. "An understanding of
being is always already contained in everything we apprehend in beings."2
But the "universality" of "being" is not that of genu.s. "Being" does not
delimit the highest region of beings so far as they are conceptually artic­
ulated according to genus and species:

oute to on genos

["Being is not a

genus"].� The "universality" of being "surpasses" the universality of genus.
According to the designation of medieval ontology, "being" is a

scendens.

tran­

Aristotle himself understood the unity of this transcendental

"universal," as opposed to the manifold of the highest generic concepts
with material content, as the

unity of analoffY.

Despite his dependence

upon Plato's ontological position, Aristotle placed the problem of being
on a fundamentally new basis with this discovery. To be sure, he too did
not clarify the obscurity of these categorial connections. Medieval ontol­
ogy discussed this problem in many ways, above

all in the Thomist and

Scotist schools, without gaining fundamental clarity. And when Hegel
fmally defines "being" as the "indeterminate immediate," and makes this
definition the foundation of all the further categorial explications of his

Logic,

he remains within the perspective of ancient ontology-except that

he does give up the problem, raised early on by Aristotle, of the unity of
being in contrast to the manifold of "categories" with material content. If
one says accordingly that "Being" is the most universal concept, that can­
not mean that it is the clearest and that it needs no further discussion.
The concept of "being" is rather the most obscure of all.
4

2.

The concept of "being" is indefinable. This conclusion was

drawn from its highest universality.4 And correctly so-if

genu.s proximum et differentiam specificam

definitio fit per

[if "definition is achieved through

the proximate genus and the specific difference"]. Indeed, "being" can­
not be understood as a being.

Enti non additur aliqua natura:

*the being [das Seiende], beingness

"Being"

Int.

I

Being

and Time

3

cannot be defined by attributing beings to it. Being cannot be derived
from higher concepts by way of definition and cannot be represented by
lower ones. But does it follow from this that "being" can no longer con­
stitute a problem? Not at all. We can conclude only that "being" is not
something like a being.* Thus the manner of definition of beings which
has its justification within limits-the "definition" of traditional logic
which is itself rooted in ancient ontology-cannot be applied to being.
The indefinability of being does not dispense with the question of its
meaning but forces it upon us.
3. "Being" is the self-evident concept. "Being" is used in all know­
ing and predicating, in every relation to beings and in every relation to
oneself, and the expression is understandable "without further ado."
Everybody understands, "The sky is blue," "I am happy," and similar
statements. But this average comprehensibility only demonstrates the
incomprehensibility. It shows that an enigma lies a priori in every rela­
tion and being toward beings as beings. The fact that we live already in
an understanding of being and that the meaning of being is at the same
time shrouded in darkness proves the fundamental necessity of repeat­
ing the question of the meaning of "being. "
If what is "self-evident" and this alone-"the covert judgments of
common reason" (Kant)-is to become and remain the explicit theme of
our analysis (as "the business of philosophers"), then the appeal to self­
evidence in the realm of basic philosophical concepts, and indeed with
regard to the concept "being," is a dubious procedure.
But consideration of the prejudices has made it clear at the same
time that not only is the answer to the question of being lacking but
even the question itself is obscure and without direction. Thus to
retrieve the question of being means first of all to work out adequately
the formulation of the question.

2. The Formal Structure of the Question of Being
The question of the meaning of being must be formulated. If it is a-or
even the-fundamental question, such questioning needs the suitable
transparency. Thus we must briefly discuss what belongs to a question in
general in order to be able to make clear that the question of being is an
eminent one.
Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking takes its direction
beforehand from what is sought. Questioning is a knowing search for
beings in their thatness and whatness. The knowing search can become an
* no! rather: no decision about being [Seyn] can be made with the help of such
conceptuality

"investigation," as the revealing determination of what the question aims
at. As questioning about . . . questioning has

what it asks about. All asking

about . . . is in some way an inquiring of . . . . Besides what is asked, what
is

interrogated

also belongs to questioning. What is questioned is to be

defmed and conceptualized in the investigating, that is, the specifically the­
oretical, question. As what is really intended, what is to be

ascertained lies

in what is questioned; here questioning arrives at its goal. As an attitude
adopted by a being, the questioner, questioning has its own character of
being. Questioning can come about as ·�us t asking around" or as an
explicitly formulated question. What is peculiar to the latter is the fact that
questioning first becomes lucid in advance with regard to all the above­
named constitutive characteristics of the question.
The question to be formulated is about the meaning of being. Thus
we are confronted with the necessity of explicating the question of being
with regard to the structural moments cited.

As a seeking, questioning needs prior guidance from what it seeks.
The meaning of being must therefore already be available to us in a
certain way. We intimated that we are always already involved in an
understanding of being. From this grows the explicit question of the
meaning of being and the tendency toward its concept. We do not

know

what "being" means. But already when we ask, "What is being'?" we
stand in an understanding of the "is" without being able to determine
conceptually what the "is" means. We do not even know the horizon
upon which we are supposed to grasp and pin down the meaning.

This

average and vague understanding of being is a fact.
No matter how much this understanding of being wavers and fades
and borders on mere verbal knowledge, this indefiniteness of the under­
standing of being that is always already available is itself a p ositive phe-

6

nomenon which needs elucidation. However, an investigation of the
meaning of being will not wish to provide this at the outset. The inter­
pretation of the average understanding of being attains its necessary
guideline only with the developed concept of being. From the clarity of
that concept and the appropriate manner of its explicit understanding
we shall be able to discern what the obscure or not yet elucidated under­
standing of being means, what kinds of obfuscation or hindrance of an
explicit elucidation of the meaning of being are possible and necessary.
Furthermore, the average, vague understanding of being can be
permeated by traditional theories and opinions about being in such a
way that these theories, as the sources of the prevailing understanding,
remain hidden. What is sought in the question of being is not com­
pletely unfamiliar, although it is at first totally ungraspable.
What is

asked about

in the question to be elaborated is being, that

which determines beings as beings, that in terms of which beings have

Int. 1

Being and Time

always been understood no matter how they are discussed. The being of
beings "is" itself not a being. The first philosophical step in understanding
the problem of being consists in avoiding the

mython tina diegeisthai,5 in not

"telling a story," that is, not determining beings as beings by tracing them
back in their origins to another being-as if being had the character of a
possible being. As what is asked about, being thus requires its own kind of
demonstration which is essentially different from the discovery of beings.
Hence what is to be ascertained, the meaning of being, will require its own
conceptualization, which again is essentially distinct from the concepts in
which beings receive their determination of meaning.
Insofar as being constitutes what is asked about, and insofar as
being means the being of beings, beings themselves tum out to be what
is

interrogated in

the question of being. Beings are, so to speak, interro­

gated with regard to their being. But if they are to exhibit the charac­
teristics of their being without falsification they must for their part have
become accessible in advance as they are in themselves. The question of
being demands that the right access to beings be gained and secured in
advance with regard to what it interrogates. But we call many things
"existent"

[seier.d],

and in different senses. Everything we talk about,

mean, and are related to is in being in one way or another. What and
how we ourselves are is also in being. Being is found in thatness and
whatness, reality, the objective presence of things

the disclosure of being to get its start? Is the starting point arbitrary, or
does a certain being have priority in the elaboration of the question of

;uf being and in what sense does it have pri­

being? Which is this exempl
ority?

If the question of being is to be explicitly formulated and brought
to complete clarity concerning itself, then the elaboration of this ques­
tion requires, in accord with what has been elucidated up to now, expli­
cation of the ways of regarding being and of understanding and con­
ceptually grasping its meaning, preparation of the possibility of the right
choice of the exemplary being, and elaboration of the genuine mode of
access to this being. Regarding, understanding and grasping, choosing,
and gaining access to, are constitutive attitudes of inquiry and are thus

themselves modes of being of a particular being, of the being we inquir­
ers ourselves in each case are. Thus to work out the question of being
means to make a being-he who questions-transparent in its being. Ask­
ing this question, as a mode of being of a being, is itself essentially deter­
mined by what is asked about in it-being.* This being which we our­
selves in each case are and which includes inquiry among the possibilities
of its being we formulate terminologicall y as Da-sein. The explicit and
lucid formulation of the question of the meaning of being requires a
prior suitable explication of a being (Da-sein) with regard to its being.t
But does not such an enterprise fall into an obvious circle? To
have to determine beings in their being beforehand and then on this
foundation first pose the question of being-what else is that but going
around in circles? In working out the question do we not presuppose
something that only the answer can provide? Formal objections such
as the argument of "circular reasoning," an argument that is always eas­
ily raised in the area of investigation of principles, are always sterile
when one is weighing concrete ways of investigating. They do not offer
anything to the understanding of the issue and they hinder penetration
into the field of investigation.
But in fact there is no circle at all in the formulation of our ques­
tion. Beings can be determined in their being without the explicit concept
of the meaning of being having to be already available. If this were not so
there could not have been as yet any ontological knowledge. And prob­
ably no one would deny the factual existence of such knowledge. It is true
that "being" is "presupposed" in all previous ontology, but not as an
available concept-not as the sort of thing we are seeking. "Presupposing"
being has the character of taking a preliminary look at being in such a
way that on the basis of this look beings that are already given are tenta­
tively articulated in their being. This guiding look at being grows out of
the average understanding of being in which we are always already
involved and which ultimatelyt belongs to the essential constitution of Da-sein
itself. Such "presupposing" has nothing to do with positing a principle
from which a series of propositions is deduced. A "circle in reasoning"
cannot possibly lie in the formulation of the question of the meaning of
being, because in answering this question it is not a matter of grounding
by deduction but rather of laying bare and exhibiting the ground.
"Circular reasoning" does not occur in the question of the mean­
ing of being. Rather, there is a notable "relatedness backward or for­
ward" of what is asked about (being) to asking as a mode of being of a

being. The way what is questioned essentially engages our questioning
belongs to the innermost meaning of the question of being. But this
only means that the being that has the character of Da-sein has a relation
to the question of being itself, perhaps even a distinctive one. But have
we not thereby demonstrated that a particular being has a priority with
respect to being and that the exemplary being that is to function as
what is primarily interrogated is pregiven?* In what we have discussed up
to now neither has the priority of Da-sein been demonstrated nor has
anything been decided about its possible or even necessary function as
the primary being to be interrogated. But certainly something like a
priority of Da-sein has announced itself.
3. The Ontological Priority of the QJJ.estion of Being

The characterization of the question of being, under the guideline of the
formal structure of the question as such, has made it clear that this
question is a unique one, such that its elaboration and even its solution
require a series of fundamental reflections. However, what is distinc­
tive about the question of being will fully come to light only when that
question is sufficiently delineated with regard to its function, intention,
and motives.
Up to now the necessity of a retrieve of the question was moti­
vated partly by its venerable origin but above all by the lack of a definite
answer, even by the lack of any adequate formulation. But one can
demand to know what purpose this question should serve. Does it
remain solely, or is it at all, only a matter of free-floating speculation
about the most general generalities-or is it the most basic and at the same
time most concrete question,
Being is always the being of a being. The totality of beings can,
with respect to its various domains, become the field where particular
areas of knowledge are exposed and delimited. These areas-for exam­
ple, history, nature, space, life, human being, language, and so on-can
in their tum become thematized as objects of scientific investigations.
Scientific research demarcates and first establishes these areas of knowl­
edge in a rough and ready fashion. The elaboration of the area in its fun­
damental structures is in a way already accomplished by prescientific
experience and interpretation of the domain of being to which the area
of knowledge is itself confined. The resulting "fundamental concepts"
comprise the guidelines for the first concrete disclc:>sure of the area.
*Again as above, an essential simplification and yet correctly thought. Da-sein is
not an instance of being for the representational abstraction of being; rather, it
is the site of the understanding of being.

Whether or not the importance of the research always lies in such estab­
lishment of concepts, its true progress comes about not so much in col­
lecting results and storing them in "handbooks" as in being forced to ask
questions about the basic constitution of each area, these questions
b eing chiefly a reaction to increasing knowledge in each area.
The real "movement" of the sciences takes place in the revision of
these basic concepts, a revision which is more or less radical and lucid with
regard to itsdf. A science's level of development is determined by the
extent to which it is

capable of a crisis in its basic

concepts. In these imma­

nent crises of the sciences the relation of positive questioning to the mat­
ter in question becomes unstable. Today tendencies to place research on
new foundations have cropped up on all sides in the various disciplines.
The discipline which is seemingly the strictest and most securely
s tructured, mathematics, has experienced a "crisis in its foundations."
The controversy between formalism and intuitionism centers on obtain­
ing and securing primary access to what should be the proper object of
this science. Relativity theory in physics grew out of the tendency to
expose nature's own coherence as it is "in itself." As a theory of the
c o n d i ti o n s o f a c c e s s to nature itself it attempts to p r e s erve the

10

immutability o f the laws o f motion b y defining all relativities; it i s thus
confronted by the question of the structure of its pre-given area of
knowledge, that is, by the problem of matter. In biology the tendency
has awakened to get behind the definitions mechanism and vitalism
have given to "organism" and "life" and to define anew the kind of
being of living beings as such. In the historical and humanistic disci­
plines the drive toward historical actuality itself has been strengthened
by the transmission and portrayal of tradition: the history of literature is
to become the history of critical problems. Theology is searching for a
more original interpretation of human being's b eing toward God, pre­
scribed by the meaning of faith itsdf and remaining within it. Theology
is slowly beginning to understand again Luther's insight that its system
of dogma rests on a "foundation" that does not s tem from a questioning
in which faith is primary and whose conceptual apparatus is not only
insufficient for the range of problems in theology but rather covers
them up and distorts them.
Fundamental concepts are determinations in which the area of
knowledge underlying all the thematic obj ects of a science attain an
understanding that precedes and guides all positive investigation. Accord­
ingly these concepts first receive their genuine evidence and "grounding"
only in a correspondingly preliminary research into the area of knowl­
edge itself. But since each of these areas arises from the domain of beings
themsdves, this preliminary research that creates the fundamental con­
cepts amounts to nothing dse than interpreting these beings in terms of

Int. 1

Being and Time

9

the basic constitution of their being. This kind of investigation must pre­
cede the positive sciences-and it can do so. The work of Plato and Aris­
totle is proof of this. Laying the foundations of the sciences in this way is
different in principle from "logic" limping along behind, investigating
here and there the status of a science in terms of its "method." Such lay­
ing of foundations is productive logic in the sense that it leaps ahead, so
to speak, into a particular realm of being, discloses it for the first time in
its constitutive being, and makes the acquired structures available to the
positive sciences as lucid directives for inquiry. Thus, for example, what
is philosophically primary is not a theory of concept-formation in histo­
riology, nor the theory of historical knowledge, nor even the theory of
history as the obj ect of historiology; what is primary is rather the inter­
pretation of genuinely historical beings with regard to their historicality.
Similarly, the positive result of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason consists in its
approach to working out what belongs to any nature whatsoever, and not
in a "theory" of knowledge. His transcendental logic is an a priori logic of
the realm of being called nature.
But such inquiry-ontology taken in its broadest sense without ref­
erence to specific ontological directions and tendencies-itself still needs
a guideline. It is true that ontological inquiry is more original than the
ontic inquiry of the positive sciences. But it remains naive and opaque if
its investigations into the being of beings leave the meaning of being in
general undiscussed. And precisely the ontological task of a genealogy of
the different possible ways of being (a genealogy which is not to be con­
strued deductively) requires a preliminary understanding of "what we
really mean by this expression 'being.'"
The question of being thus aims at an a priori condition of the pos­
sibility not only of the sciences which investigate beings of such and such
a type-and are thereby already involved in an understanding of being; but
it aims also at the condition of the possibility of the ontologies which pre­
cede the ontic sciences and found them. AU ontology, no matter how rich and
tightly knit a system of categories it has at its disposa� remains fundamentally
blind and peruens its innermost intent if it has not previously clarifaed the mean·
ing of being sufficiently and grasped this clarification as itsfundamental task.
Ontological research itself, correctly understood, gives the question
of being its ontological priority over and above merely resuming an
honored tradition and making progress on a problem until now opaque.
But this scholarly, scientific priority is not the only one.
4. The Ontic Priority of the QJJ,estion of Being

Science in general can be defined as the totality of fundamentally coher­
ent true propositions. This definition is not complete, nor does it get at

11

10

Int. 1

Being and Time

the meaning of science. As ways in which human beings behave, sci­
ences have this being's (the human being's) kind of being. We are defin­
ing this being terminologically as Da-sein. Scientific research is neither
the sole nor the most immediate kind of being of this being that is pos-

12

sible. Moreover, Da-sein itself is distinctly different from other beings.
We must make this distinct difference visible in a preliminary way. Here
the discussion must anticipate subsequent analyses which only later will
become truly demonstrative.
Da-sein is a being that does not simply occur among other beings.
Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that in its being this being
is concerned

about its very being.

Thus it is constitutive of the being of

Da-sein to have, in its very being, a relation of being to this being. And
this in tum means that Da-sein understands itself in its being in some
way and with some explicitness. It is proper to this being that it be dis­

Understanding of being is itself
a determination of being of Da-sein. * The ontic distinction of Da-sein lies in
the fact that it is ontological.

closed to itself with and through its being.

To be ontological does not yet mean to develop ontology. Thus if
we reserve the term ontology for the explicit, theoretical question of
the meaning of beings, the intended ontological character of Da-sein is
to be designated as pre-ontological. That does not signify being simply
ontical, but rather being in the manner of an understanding of being.
t
We shall call the very being to whicht Da-sein can relate in one way or
another, and somehow always does relate, existence

[Existenz]. And because

the essential definition of this being cannot be accomplished by ascribing to
it a "what" that specifies its material content, because its essence lies rather
in the fact that it in each instance has to be its being as its own, the term Da­
sein, as a pure expression of being, has been chosen to designate this being.
Da-sein always understands itself in terms of its existence, in terms
of its possibility to be itself or not to be itself. Da-sein has either chosen
these possibilities itself, stumbled upon them, or in each instance already
grown up in them. Existence is decided only by each Da-sein itself in the
manner of seizing upon or neglecting such possibilities. We come to
terms with the question of existence always only through existence itself.
We shall call

this

kind of understanding of itself

existentiell understand­

ing. The question of existence is an antic "affair" of Da-sein. For this the
theoretical transparency of the ontological structure of existence is not

necessary. The question of structure aims at the analysis of what consti­
tutes existence.* We shall call the coherence of these structures existen­
tiality. Its analysis does not have the character of an existentiell understanding but rather an existential one. The task of an existential analysis
of Da-sein is prescribed with regard to its possibility and necessity in
the ontic constitution of Da-sein.
But since existence defines Da-sein, the ontological analysis of this
being always requires a previous glimpse of existentiality. However, we
understand existentiality as the constitution of being of the being that
exists. But the idea of being already lies in the idea of such a constitution
of being. And thus the possibility of carrying out the analysis of Da-sein
depends upon the prior elaboration of the question of the meaning of
being in general.
Sciences and disciplines are ways of being of Da-sein in which Da­
sein also relates to beings that it need not itself be. But being in a world
belongs essentially to Da-sein. Thus the understanding of being that
belongs to Da-sein just as originally implies the understanding of some­
thing like "world" and the understanding of the being of beings acces­
sible within the world. Ontologies which have beings unlike Da-sein as
their theme are accordingly founded and motivated in the antic struc­
ture of Da-sein itself. This structure includes in itself the determination
of a pre-ontological understanding of being.
Thus fundamental ontology, from which alone all other ontologies
can originate, must be sought in the existential analysis of Da-sein.
Da-sein accordingly takes priority in several ways over all other
beings. The first priority is an ontic one: this being is defined in its being
by existence. The second priority is an ontological one: on the basis of its
determination as existence Da-sein is in itself "ontological." But just as
originally Da-sein possesses-in a manner constitutive of its understand­
ing of existence-an understanding of the being of all beings unlike
itself. Da-sein therefore has its third priority as the antic-ontological
condition of the possibility of all ontologies. Da-sein has proven to be
what, before all other beings, is ontologically the primary being to be
interrogated.
However, the roots of the existential analysis, for their part, are
ultimately existentiell-they are ontic. Only when philosophical research
and inquiry themselves are grasped in an existentiell way-as a possibility
of being of each existing Da-sein-does it become possible at all to dis­
close the existentiality of existence and therewith to get hold of a sufficiently grounded set of ontological problems. But with this the antic
priority of the question of being has also become clear.

The ontic-ontological priority of Da-sein was already seen early
on, without Da-sein itself being grasped in its genuine ontological struc­
ture or even becoming a problem with such an aim. Aristotle says, he psy­
che ta onta pas estin.6 The soul (of the human being) is in a certain way
beings. The "soul" which constitutes the being of human being discovers
in its ways to be-aisthesis and noesis-all beings with regard to their that­
ness and whatness, that is to say, always also in their being. Thomas
Aquinas discussed this statement-which refers back to Parmenides'
ontological thesis-in a manner characteristic of him. Thomas is engaged
in the task of deriving the "transcendentals," the characteristics of being
that lie beyond every possible generic determination of a being in its
material content, every modus specialis entis, and that are necessary
attributes of every "something," whatever it might be. For him the verum
too is to be demonstrated as being such a transcendens. This is to be
accomplished by appealing to a being which in conformity with its kind
of being is suited to "come together" with any being whatsoever. This
distinctive being, the ens quod natum est convenire cum omni ente ["the
being whose nature it is to meet with all other beings"], is the soul
(anima).7 The priority of Da-sein over and above all other beings which
emerges here without being ontologically clarified obviously has nothing
in common with a vapid subjectivizing of the totality of beings.
The demonstration of the ontic-ontological distinctiveness of the
question of being is grounded in the preliminary indication of the ontic­
ontological priority of Da-sein. But the analysis of the structure of the
question of being as such (section 2) came up against the distinctive
function of this being within the formulation of that very question. Da­
sein revealed itself to be that being which must first be elaborated in a
sufficiently ontological manner if the inquiry is to become a lucid one.
But now it has become evident that the ontological analysis of Da-sein in
general constitutes fundamental ontology, that Da-sein consequently
functions as the being that is to be interrogated fundamentally in advance
with respect to its being.
If the interpretation of the meaning of being is to become a task,
Da-sein i s not only the primary being t o b e interrogated; i n addition to
this it is the being that always already in its being is related to what is
sought in this question. But then the question of being is nothing else
than the radicalization of an essential tendency of being that belongs to
Da-sein itself, namely, of the pre-ontological understanding of being.

II
The Double Task in
Working Out the Question of Being:
The Method of the
Investigation and Its Outline

5. The Ontological Analysis of Da-sein as the Exposure of the

Horizon for an Interpretation of the Meaning of Being in General
In designating the tasks involved in "formulating" the question of being,

we showed that not only must we pinpoint the particular being that is to
function as the primary being to be interrogated but also that an explicit
appropriation and securing of correct access to this being is required.
We discussed which being it is that takes over the major role within the
question of being. But how should this being, Da-sein, become accessible
and, so to speak, be envisaged in a perceptive interpretation?
The ontic-ontological priority that has been demonstrated for Da­
sein could lead to the mistaken opinion that this being would have to be
what is primarily given also ontically-ontologically, not only in the sense
that such a being could be grasped "immediately" but also that the prior
giveness of its manner of being would be just as "immediate." True,
Da-sein is ontically not only what is near or even nearest-we ourselves

are

it, each of us. Nevertheless, or precisely for this reason, it is onto­

logically what is farthest removed. True, it belongs to its most proper
being to have an understanding of this being and to sustain a certain

13

14

Being and Time

Int.

II

interpretation of it. B u t this does n o t a t all mean that the most readily
available pre-ontological interpre tati on of its own b eing could be
adopted as an adequate guideline, as though this understanding of being
had to arise from a thematically ontological reflection on the most
proper constitution of its being. Rather, in accordance with the kind
of being belonging to it, Da-sein tends to understand its own being in
terms of that being to which it is essentially, continually, and most closely
related-the "world. " * In Da-sein itself and therewith in its own under-

16

s tanding o f being, as w e shall show, the way the world i s understood is
ontologically reflected back upon the interpretation of Da-sein.
The ontic-ontological priority of Da-sein is therefore the reason
why the specific constitution of the being of Da-sein-understood in the
sense of the " categorial" structure that belongs to it-remains hidden
from it. Da-sein is ontically "nearest" to itself, ontologically farthest
away; but pre-ontologically certainly not foreign to itself.
We have merely precursorily indicated that an interpretation of
this being is confronted with peculiar difficulties rooted in the mode of
being of the thematic object and the way it is thematized. They do not
result from some shortcoming of our powers of knowledge or lack of a
suitable way of conceiving-a lack seemingly easy to remedy.
Not only does an understanding of being belong to Da-sein, but
this understanding also develops or decays according to the actual man­
ner of being of Da-sein at any given time; for this reason it has a wealth
of interpretations at its disposal. Philosophical psychology, anthropology,
ethics, "politics," poetry, biography, and historiography pursue in dif­
ferent ways and to varying extents the behavior, faculties , powers, pos­
sibilities, and destinies of Da-sein. But the question remains whether
these interpretations were carri ed out in as original an existential man­
ner as their existentiell originality perhaps merited. The two do not
necessarily go together, but they also do not exclude one another. Exis­
tentiell interpretation can require existential analysis, provided philo­
sophical knowledge is understood in its possibility and necessity. Only
when the fundamental structures of Da-sein are adequately worked out
with explicit orientation toward the problem of being will the previous
results of the interpretation of Da-sein receive their existential justifica­
tion.
Hence the first concern in the question of being must be an anal­
ysis of Da-sein. But then the problem of gaining and securing the kind of
access that leads to Da-sein truly b ecomes crucial. Expressed negatively,
no arbitrary idea of being and reality, no matter how "self-evident" it is,
may be brought to bear on this being in a dogmatically constructed

* i.e., here in terms of what is objectively present.

Int. 11

15

way; no "categories" prescribed by such ideas may be forced upon Da­
sein without ontological deliberation. The manner of access and inter­
pretation must instead be chosen in such a way that this being can show
itself to itself on its own terms. And furthermore, this manner should
show that being as it is

dayness.

initially and for the most part-in its average every­

Not arbitrary and accidental structures but essential ones are to

be demonstrated in this everydayness, structures that remain determinative i n every mode o f being o f factual Da-sein. B y looking at the fun­
damental constitution of the everydayness of Da-sein we shall bring out
in a preparatory way the being of this being.
The analytic of Da-sein thus understood is wholly oriented toward
the guiding task of working out the question of being. Its limits are
thereby determined. It cannot hope to provide a complete ontology of
Da-sein, which of course must be supplied if something like a "philo­
sophical" anthropology is to rest on a philosophically adequate basis.
With a view to a possible anthropology or its ontological foundation, the
following interpretation will provide only a few "parts," although not
inessential ones. However, the analysis of Da-sein is not only incom­
plete but at first also

preliminary.

It only brings out the being of this

b eing without interpreting its meaning. Its aim is rather to expose the
horizon for the most primordial interpretation of being. Once we have
reached that horizon the preparatory analytic of Da-sein requires repe­
tition on a higher, genuinely ontological basis .
The meaning of the being of that being we call Da-sein proves to
be

temporality [Zeitlichkeit].

In order to demonstrate this we must repeat

our interpretation of those s tructures of Da-sein that shall have been
indicated in a preliminary way-this time as modes of temporality. While
it is true that with this interpretation of Da-sein as temporality the
answer to the guiding question about the meaning of being in general is
not already given, * the soil from which we may reap it will nevertheless
be prepared.
We intimated that a pre-ontological being belongs to Da-sein as its
antic constitution. Da-sein is in such a way that, by being, it understands
something like being. Remembering this connection, we must show that

time is

that from which Da-sein tacitly understands and interprets s ome­

thing like b eing at all. Time must be brought to light and genuinely
grasped as the horizon of every understanding and interpretation of

original explication of time as
the horizon of the understanding of being, in terms of temporality as the being of
Da-sein which understands being. This task as a whole requires that the
being. For this to become clear we need an

concept of time thus gained be distinguished from the common under-

standing of it. The latter has become explicit in an interpretation of
time which reflects the traditional concept that has persisted since Aris­
totle and beyond Bergson. We must thereb y make clear that and in
what way this concept of time and the common understanding of time
in general originate from temporality. In this way the common concept
of time receives again its rightful autonomy-contrary to Bergson's the­
sis that time understood in the common way is really space.
"Time" has long served as the ontological-or rather antic-crite­
rion for naively distinguishing the different regions of beings. "Tempo­
ral" beings (natural processes and historical events) are separated from
"atemporal" beings (spatial and numerical relationships). We are accus­
tomed to distinguishing the "timeless" meaning of propositions from the
"temporal" course of propositional statements. Further, a "gap" between
"temporal" being and "supratemporal" eternal being is found, and the
attempt made to bridge the gap. "Temporal" here means as much as
being "in time, " an obscure enough definition to be sure. The fact
remains that time

in the sense of "being in time" serves as a criterion for

separating the regions of being. How time comes to have this distinctive
ontological function, and even with what right precisely something like
time serves as such a criterion, and most of all whether in this naive
ontological application of time its genuinely possible ontological rele­
vance is expressed, has neither been asked nor investigated up to now.
"Time," especially on the horizon of the common understanding of it,
has chanced to acquire this "obvious" ontological function "of itself, " as
it were, and has held onto it until today.
In contrast we must show, on the basis of the question of the
meaning of being which shall have been worked out,

that-and in what
way-the central range ofproblems of all ontology is rooted in the phenomenon of
time correctly viewed and correctly explained.
If being is to be conceived in terms of time and if the various
modes and derivatives of being, in their modifications and derivations,

and in fact to become intelligible through consideration of time, then
being itself-and not only beings that are "in time"-is made visible in its
"temporal"

["zeitlich"]

character. But then "temporal" can no longer

mean only "being in time." The "atemporal" and the " supratemporal"
are also "temporal" with respect to their being; this not only by way of
privation when compared to "temporal" beings which are "in time,"

19

but in a positive way which, of course, must first be clarified. Because the
expression "temporal" belongs to both prephilosophical and philo­
sophical usage, and because that expression will be used in a different
sense in the following investigations, we shall call the original determi­
nation of the meaning of being and its characters and modes which
devolve fro m time its

temporal [temporale]

determination. The funda-

Int.

II

Being and Time

17

mental ontological task of the interpretation o f being a s such thus
includes the elaboration of the temporality of being [Temporalitiit des Seins].
In the exposition of the problem of temporality the concrete answer to
the question of the meaning of being is first given.
Because being is in each instance comprehensible only in regard to
time, the answer to the question of being cannot lie in an isolated and
blind proposition. The answer is not grasped by repeating what is stated
propositionally, especially when it is transmitted as a free-floating result,
so that we merely take notice of a "standpoint" which perhaps deviates
from the way the matter has been previously treated. Whether the
answer is "novel" is of no importance and remains extrinsic. What is pos­
itive about the answer must lie in the fact that it is old enough to enable
us to learn to comprehend the possibilities prepared by the "ancients. "
I n conformity t o its most proper sense, the answer provides a directive
for concrete ontological research, that is, a directive to begin its inves­
tigative inquiry within the horizon exhibited-and that is all it provides.
If the answer to the question of being thus becomes the guiding
directive for research, then it is sufficiently given only if the specific
mode of being of previous ontology-the vicissitudes of its questioning,
its findings, and its failures-becomes visible as necessary to the very
character of Da-sein.

6. The Task of a Destructuring of the History of Ontology
All research-especially when it moves in the sphere of the central ques­

tion of being-is an antic possibility of Da-sein. The being of Da-sein
finds its meaning in temporality. But temporality is at the same time the
condition of the possibility of historicity as a temporal mode of being of
Da-sein itself, regardless of whether and how it is a being "in time." As a
determination historicity is prior to what is call e d history (world-historical occurrences). Historicity means the constitution of being of the
"occurrence" of Da-sein as such; it is the ground for the fact that some­
thing like the discipline of "world history" is at all possible and historically belongs to world history. In its factual being Da-sein always is as and
"what" it already was. Whether explicitly or not, it is its past. It is its
own past not only in such a way that its past, as it were, pushes itself
along "behind" it, and that it possesses what is past as a property that is
still objectively present and at times has an effect on it. Da-sein "is" its
past in the manner of its being which, roughly expressed, on each occasion "occurs" out of its future. In its manner of existing at any given
time, and accordingly also with the understanding of being that belongs
to it, Da-sein grows into a customary interpretation of itself and grows
up in that interpretation. It understands itself in terms of this interpre-

20

18

Int.

Being and Time

tation at first, and

II

within a certain range, constantly. This understanding

discloses the possibilities of its being and regulates them. Its own past­
and that always means that of its "generation" -does not follow

after Da­

sein but rather always already goes ahead of it.
This elemental historicity of Da-sein can remain concealed from it.
But it can also be discovered in a certain way and be properly culti­
vated. Da-sein can discover, preserve, and explicitly pursue tradition.
The discovery of tradition and the disclosure of what it "transmits," and
how it does this, can be undertaken as a task in its own right. Da-sein
thus assumes the mode of being that involves historical inquiry and
research. But the discipline of history-more precisely, the historicality
underlying it-is possible only as the kind of being belonging to inquiring
Da-sein, because Da-sein is determined by historicity in the ground of its
being. If historicity remains concealed from Da-sein, and so long as it
does so, the possibility of historical inquiry and discovery of history is
denied it. If the discipline of history is lacking, that is no evidence

against

the historicity of Da-sein; rather it is evidence for this constitution of
being in a deficient mode. Only because it is "historic" in the first place
can an age lack the discipline of history.
On the other hand, if Da-sein has seized upon its inherent possi­
bility not only of making its existence transparent but also of inquiring
into the meaning of existentiality itself, that is to say, of provisionally
inquiring into the meaning of being in general; and if insight into the
essential historicity of Da-sein has opened up in such inquiry, then it is
inevitable that inquiry into being, which was designated with regard
to its ontic-ontological necessity, is itself characterized by historicity.
The elaboration of the question of being must therefore receive its

21

directive to inquire into its own history from the most proper ontolog­
ical sense of the inquiry itself, as a historical one; that means to become
historical in a disciplined way in order to come to the positive appro­
priation of the past, to come into full possession of its most proper
possibilities of inquiry. The question of the meaning of being is led to
understand itself as historical in accordance with its own way of pro­
ceeding, that is, as the provisional explication of Da-sein in its tempo­
rality and historicity.
The preparatory interpretation of the fundamental structures of
Da-sein with regard to its usual and average way of being-in which it is
also first of all historical-will make the following clear: Da-sein not only
has the inclination to be entangled in the world in which it is and to
interpret itself in terms of that world by its reflected light; at the same
time Da-sein is also entangled in a tradition which it more or less explic­
itly grasps. This tradition deprives Da-sein of its own leadership in ques­
tioning and choosing. This is especially true of that understanding (and

Int.

II

Being and Time

19

its possible development) which i s rooted in the most proper being o f
Da-sein-the ontological understanding.
The tradition that hereby gains dominance makes what it "trans­
mits" so little accessible that initially and for the most part it covers it
over instead. What has been handed down i t hands over to obvious­
ness; it bars access to those original "wellsprings" out of which the tra­
ditional categories and concepts were in part genuinely drawn. The tra­
dition even makes us forget such a provenance altogether. Indeed, it
makes us wholly incapable of even understanding that such a return is
necessary. The tradition uproots the historicity of Da-sein to such a
degree that it only takes an interest in the manifold forms of possible
types, directions, and standpoints of philosophizing in the most remote
and strangest cultures, and with this interest tries to veil its own ground­
lessness . Consequently, in spite of all historical interest and zeal for a
philologically "objective" interpretation, Da-sein no longer understands
the most elementary conditions which alone make a posi tive return to
the past possible-in the sense of its productive appropriation.
At the outset ( section

1) we showed that the

question of the mean­

ing of being was not only unresolved, not only inadequately formulated,
but in spite of all interest in "metaphysics" has even been forgotten.
Greek ontology and its history, which through many twists and turns
still define the conceptual character of philosophy today, are proof of the
fac t that Da-sein understands itself and being in general in terms of the
"world. " The ontology that thus arises is ensnared by the tradition, which
allows it to sink to the level of the obvious and become mere material for
reworking (as it was for Hegel) . Greek ontology thus uprooted becomes
a fixed body of doctrine in the Middle Ages. But its systematics is not at
all a mere joining together of traditional elements into a single structure. Within the limits of i ts dogmatic adoption of the fundamental
Greek conceptions of being, this systematics contains a great deal of

scholastic mold,
disputationes meta­

unpretentious work which does make advances. In its
Greek ontology makes the essential transition via the

pkysicae of Suarez

into the "metaphysics" and transcendental philosophy

of the modem period; it still determines the foundations and goals of
Hegel's

Logic.

Insofar as certain distinctive domains of being become

visible in the course of this history and henceforth chiefly dominate the
range of problems (Descartes'

ego cogito,

subject, the

"I," reason, spirit,

person), the beings just cited remain unquestioned with respect to the
being and structure of their being, which indicates the thorough neglect
of the question of being. But the categorial content of traditional ontology is trans ferred to these beings with corresponding formalizations and
purely negative restrictions, or else dialectic is called upon to help with an
ontological interpretation of the substantiality of the subject.

If the question of being is to achieve clarity regarding its own his­
tory, a loosening of the sclerotic tradition and a dissolving of the con­
cealments produced by it is necessary. We understand this task as the de­
structuring of the traditional content of ancient ontology which is to
be carried out along the guidelines of the question of being. This destruc­
turing is based upon the original experiences in which the first and sub­
sequently guiding determinations of being were gained.
This demonstration of the provenance of the fundamental onto­
logical concepts, as the investigation which displays their "birth certifi­
cate," has nothing to do with a pernicious relativizing of ontological
standpoints. The destructuring has just as little the negative sense of dis­
burdenmg ourselves of the ontological tradition. On the contrary, it
should stake out the positive possibilities of the tradition, and that always
means to fix its boundaries. These are factually given with the specific for­
mulation of the question and the prescribed demarcation of the possible
field of investigation. Negatively, the destructuring is not even related to
the past: its criticism concerns "today" and the dominant way we treat
the history of ontology, whether it be conceived as the history of opin­
ions, ideas, or problems. However, the destructuring does not wish to
bury the past in nullity; it has a positive intent. Its negative function
remains tacit and indirect.
The destructuring of the history of ontology essentially belongs
to the formulation of the question of being and is possible solely within
such a formulation. Within the scope of this treatise, which has as its
goal a fundamental elaboration of the question of being, the destruc­
turing can be carried out only with regard to the fundamentally decisive
stages of this history.
In accord with the positive tendency of the destructuring the ques­
tion must first be asked whether and to what extent in the course of the
history of ontology in general the interpretation of being has been the­
matically connected with the phenomenon of time. We must also ask
whether the range of problems concerning temporality which necessar­
ily belongs here was fundamentally worked out or could have been.
Kant is the first and only one who traversed a stretch of the path toward
investigating the dimension of temporality-or allowed himself to be
driven there by the compelling force of the phenomena themselves.
Only when the problem of temporality is pinned down can we succeed
in casting light on the obscurity of his doctrine of the schematism. Fur­
thermore, in this way we can also show why this area had to remain
closed to Kant in its real dimensions and in its central ontological func­
tion. Kant himself knew that he was venturing forth into an obscure
area: "This schematism of our understanding as regards appearances
and their mere form is an art hidden in the depths of the human soul,

Int. 11

Being and

21

Time

th e true devices o f which are hardly ever t o b e divined from Nature
and laid uncovered before our eyes. "1 What it is that Kant shrinks back
from here, as it were, must be brought to light thematically and in prin­
ciple if the expression "being" is to have a demonstrable meaning. Ulti­
mately the phenomena to be explicated in the following analysis under
the rubric of "temporality" are precisely those that determine the

covert judgments

most

of "common reason, " analysis of which Kant calls the

"business of philosophers . "
I n pursuing the task of destructuring on the guideline o f the prob­
lem of temporality the following treatise will attempt to interpret the
chapter on the schematism and the Kantian doctrine of time developed
there. At the same time we must show why Kant could never gain insight
into the problem of temporality. Two things prevented this insight. On
the one hand, the neglect of the question of being in general, and in
connection with this, the lack of a thematic ontology of Da-sein-in Kantian terms, the lack of a preliminary ontological analytic of the subjectivity of the subject. Instead, Kant dogmatically adopted Descartes' posi­
tion-notwithstanding all his essential advances. Despite his taking this
phenomenon back into the subj e ct, however, his analysis of time
remains oriented toward the traditional, common understanding of it. It
is this that finally prevented Kant from working out the phenomenon of
a "transcendental determination of time" in its own structure and function. As a consequence of this double effect of the tradition, the decisive

connection between time and the "I think" remained shrouded in complete
obscurity. It did not even become a problem.
By taking over Descartes' ontological position Kant neglects some­
thing essential: an ontology of Da-sein. In terms of Descartes' inner­
most tendency this omission is a decisive one. With the

cogito sum

Descartes claims to prepare a new and secure foundation for philosophy.
But what he leaves undetermined in this "radical" beginning is the man­
ner of being of the

"sum. " Working

will cons titute the second stage of the destructuring of, and the path
back into, the history of ontology. The interpretation will demonstrate
not only that Descartes had to neglect the question of being altogether
but also why he held the opinion that the absolute " certainty" of the

ito exempted him from

cog­

the question of the meaning of the b eing of this

being.
However, with Descartes it is not just a matter of neglect and thus
of a complete ontological indeterminateness of the res cogitans sive

sive animus ["the thinking thing,

whether it be mind or spirit"]. Descartes

carries out the fundamental reflections of his

But createdness, in the broadest sense

of something having been produced, is an essential structural moment of
the ancient concept of being. The ostensibly new beginning of philoso­
phizing betrays the imposition of a fatal prejudice. On the basis of this
prejudice later times neglect a thematic ontological analysis of "the mind"

["Gemilt"]

which would be guided by the question of being; likewise they

neglect a critical confrontation with the inherited ancient ontology.
Everyone familiar with the medieval period sees that Descartes is
"dependent" upon medieval scholasticism and uses its terminology. But
with this "discovery" nothing is gained philosophically as long as it remains
obscure to what a profound extent medieval ontology influences the way
posterity determines or fails to determine the

res

cogitans ontologically. The

full extent of this influence canno t be estimated until the meaning and lim­
its of ancient ontology have been shown by our orientation toward the
question of being. In other words, the destructuring sees itself assigned the
task of interpreting the foundation of ancient ontology in light of the
problem of temporality. Here it becomes evident that the ancient inter­
pretation of the being of beings is oriented toward the "world" or "nature"
in the broadest sense and that it indeed gains its understanding of being
from " time. " The outward evidence of this-but of course only outward-is
the determination of the meaning of being as

parousia or ousia, which

are grasped in their being as "presence"; that is to say, they are understood
with regard to a definite mode of time, the present.
The problem of Greek ontology must, like that of any ontology,
take i ts guideline from Da-sein itself. In the ordinary and also the philo­
sophical " definition," Da-sein, that is, the being of human being, is delin­
eated as

zoon logon echon,

that creature whose being is essentially deter­

mined by its ability to speak.

Legein

( cf. section

7,

b) is the guideline

for arriving at the structures of being of the beings we encounter in
speech and discussion. That is why the ancient ontology developed by
Plato becomes " dialectic." The possibility of a more radical conception
of the problem of being grows with the continuing development of the
ontological guideline itself, that is, with the "hermeneutics" of the

logos.

"Dialectic," which was a genuine philosophic embarrassment, becomes
superfluous . Aristotle "no longer has any understanding" of it for

this

reason, that he places it on a more radical foundation and transcends it.

Legein itself,
26

or noein-the simple apprehension of something objectively

present in its pure obj ective presence

[ Vorhandenheit], which Parmenides

already used as a guide for interpreting being-has the temporal struc-

Int.

II

Being and Time

23

ture of a pure "making present" of something. Beings, which show them­
selves in and for this making present and which are understood as gen­
uine beings, are accordingly interpreted with regard to the present; that
is to say, they are conceived as presence (ousia).
However, this Greek interpretation of being comes about without
any explicit knowledge of the guideline functioning in it, without taking
cognizance of or understanding the fundamental ontological function of
time, without insight into the ground of the possibility of this function.
On the contrary, time itself is taken to be one being among others. The
attempt is made to grasp time itself in the structure of its being on the
horizon of an understanding of being which is oriented toward time in
an inexplicit and naive way.
Within the framework of the following fundamental elaboration of
the question of being we canno t offer a detailed temporal interpretation
of the foundations of ancient ontology-especially of its scientifically
highest and purest stage, that is, in Aristotle. Instead, we offer an inter­
pretation of Aristotle's treatise on time/ which can be taken as a way of
discerning the basis and limits of the ancient science of being.
Aristotle's treatise on time is the first detailed interpretation of
this phenomenon that has come down to us. It essentially determined all
the following interpretations, including that of Bergson. From our anal­
ysis of Aristotle's concept of time it becomes retrospectively clear that
the Kantian interpretation moves within the structures developed by
Aristotle. This means that Kant's fundamental ontological orientation­
despite all the differences implicit in a new inquiry-remains Greek.
The question of being attains true concreteness only when we
carry out the destructuring of the ontological tradition. By so doing we
can thoroughly demonstrate the inescapability of the question of the
meaning of being and so demonstrate the meaning of our talk about a
"retrieve" of this question.
In this field where "the matter itself is deeply veiled,"� any investi­
gation will avoid overestimating its results. For such inquiry is constantly
forced to face the possibility of disclosing a still more original and more
universal horizon from which it could draw the answer to the question
"What does 'being' mean?" We can discuss such possibilities seriously
and with a positive result only if the question of being has been reawakened and we have reached the point where we can come to terms with it
in a controlled fashion.
7. The Phenomenological Method of the Investigation

With the preliminary characterization of the thematic object of the inves­
tigation (the being of beings, or the meaning of being in general) its

27

24

28

Being and Time

Int. 11

method would appear to be already prescribed. The task of ontology is
to set in relief the being of beings and to explicate being itself. And the
method of ontology remains questionable in the highest degree as long
as we wish merely to consult historically transmitted ontologies or simi­
lar efforts . Since the term "ontology" is used in a formally broad sense
for this investigation, the approach of clarifying its method by tracing
the history of that method is automatically precluded.
In using the term "ontology" we do not specify any particular
philosophical discipline standing in relation to others. It should not at all
be our task to satisfy the demands of any established discipline. On the
contrary, such a discipline can be developed only from the objective
necessity of particular ques tions and procedures demanded by the
"things themselves."
With the guiding question of the meaning of being the investiga­
tion arrives at the fundamental question of philosophy in general. The
treatment of this question is phenomenological. With this term the treatise
dictates for itself neither a "standpoint" nor a "direction," because phe­
nomenology is neither of these and can never be as long as it under­
stands itself. The expression "phenomenology" signifies primarily a con­
cept of method. It does not characterize the "what" of the obj ects of
philosophical research in terms of their content but the "how" of such
research. The more genuinely effective a concept of method is and the
more comprehensively it determines the fundamental conduct of a sci­
ence, the more originally is it rooted in confrontation with the things
themselves and the farther away it moves from what we call a technical
device-of which there are many in the theoretical disciplines.
The term "phenomenology" expresses a maxim that can be formulated: "To the things themselves! " It is opposed to all free-floating
constructions and accidental findings; it is also opposed to taking over
concepts only seemingly demonstrated; and likewise to pseudo-ques­
tions which often are spread abroad as "problems" for generations. But
one might object that this maxim is, after all, abundantly self-evident
and, moreover, an expression of the principle of all scientific knowl­
edge. It is not clear why this commonplace should be explicitly put in the
tide of our research. In fact, we are dealing with "something self-evi­
dent" which we want to get closer to, insofar as that is important for the
clarification of procedure in our treatise. We shall explicate only the
preliminary concept of phenomenology.
The expression has two components, phenomenon and logos .
Both go back to the Greek terms phainomenon and logos. Viewed extrin­
sically, the word "phenomenology" is formed like the terms theology,
biology, sociology, translated as the science of God, of life, of the com­
munity. Accordingly, phenomenology would be the science of phenom-

Int.

II

Being and Time

25

ena.

The preliminary concept of phenomenology is to be exhibited by
characterizing what is meant by the two components, phenomenon and
logos, and by establishing the meaning of the combined word. The history
of the word itself, which originated presumably with the Wolffian school,
is not important here.
(a) The Concept of Phenomenon. The Greek expression phairwmenon, from
which the term "phenomenon" derives, comes from the verb phainesthai,
meaning "to show itself." Thus phainomenon means what shows itself, the
self-showing, the manifest. Phainesthai itself is a "middle voice" con­
struction of phaino, to bring into daylight, to place in brightness. Phaino
belongs to the root pha-, like pkOs, light or brightness, that is, that within

which something can become manifest, visible in itself. Thus the mean­
ing of the expression "phenomenon" is established as what shows itself in
itself, what is manifesL The phainomena, "phenomena," are thus the total­
ity of what lies in the light of day or can be brought to light. Sometimes
the Greeks simply identified this with ta onta (beings). Beings can show
themselves from themselves in various ways, depending on the mode of
access to them. The possibility even exists that they can show them­
selves as they are not in themselves. In this self-showing beings "look
like . . . . " Such self-showing we call seeming [Scheinen]. And so the expression phainomenon, phenomenon, means in Greek: what looks like some­
thing, what "seems," "semblance." Phainomenon agathon means a good
that looks like-but "in reality" is not what it gives itself out to be. It is
extremely important for a further understanding of the concept of phe­
nomenon to see how what is named in both meanings of phainomenon
("phenomenon" as self-showing and "phenomenon" as semblance) are
structurally connected. Only because something claims to show itself
in accordance with its meaning at all, that is, claims to be a phe­
nomenon, can it show itself as something it is not, or can it "only look
like . . . . " The original meaning (phenomenon, what is manifest) already
contains and is the basis of phainomenon ("semblance"). We attribute
to the term "phenomenon" the positive and original meaning of phain­
omenon terminologically, and separate the phenomenon of semblance
from it as a privative modification. But what both terms express has at
first nothing at all to do with what is called "appearance" or even "mere
appearance."
One speaks of "appearances or symptoms of illness. " What is
meant by this are occurrences in the body that show themselves and in
this self-showing as such "indicate" something that does not show itself.
When such occurrences emerge, their self-showing coincides with the
objective presence [Vorhandensein] of disturbances that do not show
themselves. Appearance, as the appearance "of something," thus pre-

29

26

Int.

Being and Time

cisely does

not

II

mean that something shows itself; rather, it means that

something makes itself known which does not show itself. It makes itself
known through something that does show itself. Appearing is * a

showing itself

not

But this "not" must by no means be confused with the

privative not which determines the structure of semblance. What does

not show

itself, in the manner of what appears, can also never seem. All

indications, presentations, symptoms, and symbols have this funda­
mental formal structure of appearing, although they do differ among
themselves.
Although "appearing" is never a self-showing in the sense of phe­
nomenon, appearing is possible only on

the basis of a self-showing of some­

thing. But this, the self-showing that makes appearing possible, is not
appearing itself. Appearing is a

making itself known

through something

that shows its elf. If we then say that with the word "appearance" we are
pointing to something in which something appears without itself being
an appearance, then the concept of phenomenon is not thereby delim-

30

ited but

presupposed.

However, this presupposition remains hidden

because the expression " to appear" in this definition of "appearance" is
used in two senses. That in which something "appears" means that in
which something makes itself known, that is, does not show itself; in
the expression "without itself being an 'appearance'" appearance means
the self-showing. But this self-showing essentially belongs to the "wherein"
in which something makes itself known. Accordingly, phenomena are

never

appearances, but every appearance is dependent upon phenom­

ena. If we define phenomenon with the help of a concept of "appear­
ance" that is s till unclear, then everything is turned upside down, and a
"critique" of phenomenology on this basis is surely a remarkable enter­
prise.
The expression " appearance" itself in turn can have a double
meaning. First,

appearing in

the sense of making itself known as some­

thing that does not show itself and, second,

in the sense of what does

the

making itself known-what in its self-showing indicates something that
does not show itself. Finally, one can use appearing as the term for the
genuine meaning of phenomenon as self-showing. If one designates
these three different states of affairs as " appearance" confusion is
inevitable.
However, this confusion is considerably increased by the fact that
"appearance" can take on s till ano ther meaning. If one understands

what is essentially

never manifest-if this is so, then appearance is tanta­
[Hervorbringung] or to what is produced [Her·

mount to production

vorgebrachter].

However, this does not constitute the real being of the pro­

ducing or productive

[Hervorbringende] ,

but is rather appearance in the

sense of "mere appearance . " What does the making itself known and is
brought forward indeed shows itself in such a way that, as the emanation
of what it makes known, it precisely and continually veils what it is in
itself. But then again this not-showing which veils is not semblance.
Kant uses the term "appearance" in this twofold way. On the one hand,
appearances are for him the " obj ects of empirical intuition, " what shows
itself in intuition. This self-showing (phenomenon in the genuine, orig­
inal sense) is, on the other hand, "appearance" as the emanation of
something that makes itself known but

conceals itself in

the appearance.

Since a phenomenon is constitutive for "appearance" in the sense
of making itself known through a s elf-showing, and since this phe­
nomenon can tum into semblance in a privative way, appearance can
also tum into mere semblance. Under a certain kind of light someone
can look as if he were flushed. The redness that shows i tself can be
taken a s making known the objective presence o f fever; this i n tum
would indicate a disturbance in the organism.

Phenomenon-the

self-showing in itself-means a distinctive way

something can be encountered. On the other hand,

appearance means a
referring

referential relation in beings themselves such that what does the

( the making known) can fulfill its possible function only if i t shows itself
in itself-only if it is a "phenomenon." Both appearance and semblance
are themselves founded in the phenomenon, albeit in different ways.
The confusing multiplicity of "phenomena" designated by the terms
phenomenon, semblance, appearance, mere appearance, can be unrav­
eled only if the concept of phenomenon is understood from the very
beginning as the s elf-showing in itself.
But if in the way we grasp the concept of phenomenon we leave
undetermined which beings are to be addressed as phenomena, and if
we leave altogether open whether the self-showing is actually a particular
being or a characteristic of the being of beings , then we are dealing
solely with the formal concept of phenomenon. If by the self-showing we
understand those beings that are accessible, for example, in Kant's sense
of empirical intuition, the formal concept of phenomenon can be used
legitimately. In this usage phenomenon has the meaning of the

common

concept of phenomenon. But this common one is not the phenomeno­
logical concept of phenomenon. In the horizon of the Kantian problem
what is understood phenomenologically by the term phenomenon (dis­
regarding other differences) can be illustrated when we say that what
already shows itself in appearances prior to and always accompanying

31

28

Int.

Being and Time

II

what we commonly understand as phenomena, though unthematically,
can be brought thematically to self-showing. What thus shows itself in
itself ("the forms of intuition") are the phenomena of phenomenology.
For, clearly, space and time must be able to show themselves in this
way. They must be able to become phenomena if Kant claims to make a
valid transcendental statement when he says that space is the a priori
"wherein" of an order.
Now if the phenomenological concept of phenomenon is to be
understood at all (regardless of how the self-showing may be more
closely determined), we must inevitably presuppose insight into the
sense of the formal concept of phenomenon and the legitimate use of
phenomenon in its ordinary meaning. However, before getting hold of
the preliminary concept of phenomenology we must delimit the mean­
ing of logos, in order to make clear in which sense phenomenology can
be "a science of" phenomena.
32

(b) The Concept of Logos. The concept of logos has many meanings in

Plato and Aristotle, indeed in such a way that these meanings diverge
without a basic meaning positively taking the lead. This is in fact only an
illusion which lasts so long as an interpretation is not able to grasp ade­
quately the basic meaning in its primary content. If we say that the basic
meaning of logos is speech, this literal translation becomes valid only
when we define what speech itself means. The later history of the word
logos, and especially the manifold and arbitrary interpretations of sub­
sequent philosophy, conceal constantly the real meaning of speech­
which is manifest enough. Logos is "translated," and that always means
interpreted, as reason, judgment, concept, definition, ground, relation.
But how can "speech" be so susceptible of modification that logos means
all the things mentioned, and indeed in scholarly usage? Even if logos is
understood in the sense of a statement, and statement as '1udgment,"
this apparently correct translation can still miss the fundamental mean­
ing-especially if judgment is understood in the sense of some contem­
porary "theory of judgment. " Logos does not mean judgment, in any
case not primarily, if by judgment we understand "connecting two
things" or "taking a position" either by endorsing or rejecting.
Rather, logos as speech really means deloun, to make manifest "what
is being talked about" in speech. Aristotle explicates this function of
speech more precisely as apophainesthai.4 Logos lets som�thing be seen
(phainesthai), namely what is being talked about, and indeed for the
speaker (who serves as the medium) or for those who speak with each
other. Speech "lets us see," from itself, apo . . , what is being talked
about. In speech (apophansis), insofar as it is genuine, what is said should
be derivedfrom what is being talked about. In this way spoken commu.

Int. n

Being and Time

29

nication, in what it says, makes manifest what it is talking about and
thus makes it accessible to another. Such is the structure of logos as apo­
phansis. Not every "speech" suits this mode of making manifest, in the
sense of letting something be seen by indicating it. For example, request­
ing (euche) also makes something manifest, but in a different way.
When fully concrete, speech (letting something be seen) has the
character of speaking or vocalization in words. Logos is phone, indeed
phone meta phantasias-vocalization in which something always is sighted.
Only because the function of logos as ap()jlhansis lies in letting some­
thing be seen by indicating it can logos have the structure of synthesis.
Here synthesis does not mean to connect and conjoin representations,
to manipulate psychical occurrences, which then gives rise to the "prob­
lem" of how these connections, as internal, correspond to what is exter­
nal and physical. The syn [of synthesis] here has a purely apophantical
meaning: to let something be seen in its togetherness with something, to
let something be seen as something.
Furthermore, because logos lets something be seen, it can therefore
be true or false. But everything depends on staying clear of any concept
of truth construed in the sense of "correspondence" or "accordance"
[ Ubereinstimmung] . This idea is by no means the primary one in the con­
cept of aletheia. The "being true" of logos as aletheuein means: to take
beings that are being talked about in legein as apophainesthai out of their
concealment; to let them be seen as something unconcealed (alethes); to
discover them. Similarly "being false," pseudesthai, is tantamount to deceiv­
ing in the sense of covering up: putting something in front of some­
thing else (by way of letting it be seen) and thereby passing it off as
something it is not.
But because "truth" has this meaning, and because logos is a spe­
cific mode of letting something be seen, logos simply may not be
acclaimed as the primary "place" of truth. If one defines truth as what
"genuinely" pertains to judgment, which is quite customary today, and if
one invokes Aristotle in support of this thesis, such a procedure is with­
out justification and the Greek concept of truth thoroughly misunder­
stood. In the Greek sense what is "true"-indeed more originally true
than the logos we have been discussing-is aisthesis, the simple sense per­
ception of something. To the extent that an aisthesis aims at its idia
[what is its own]-the beings genuinely accessible only through it and for
it, for example, looking at colors-perception is always true. This means
that looking always discovers colors, hearing always discovers tones .
What i s i n the purest and most original sense " true"-that is, what only
discovers in such a way that it can never cover up anything-is pure
noein, straightforwardly observant apprehension of the simplest deter­
minations of the being of beings as such. This noein can never cover

33

30

up, can never be false; at worst it can be a nonapprehending,

II

agnoein,

not sufficing for straightforward, appropriate access.

34

What no longer takes the form of a pure letting be seen, but rather
in its indicating always has recourse to something else and so always
lets something be seen as something, acquires with this structure of syn­
thesis the possibility of covering up. However, "truth of judgment" is
only the opposite of thi s covering up; it is a

multiplyfounded

phe­

nomenon of truth. Realism and idealism alike thoroughly miss the mean­
ing of the Greek concept of truth from which alone the possibility of
something like a " theory of Ideas" can be understood as philosophical

knowledge.

And because the function of logos lies in letting something be

seen straightforwardly, in

reason.

Moreover, because

letting beings be apprehended, logos can mean
logos is used in the sense not only of legein but

legomenon-what is pointed to as such; and because the latter is
hypokeimenon-what always already lies present at
the basis of all relevant speech and discussion; for these reasons logos
qua legomenon means ground, ratio. Finally, because logos as legomenon

can also mean what is addressed, as something that has become visible in
its relation to something else, in its "relatedness,"

logos

acquires the

meaning of relation and relationship.
This interpretation of " apophantic speech" may suffice to clarify
the primary function of logos .

(c) The Preliminary Concept of Phenomenology.

When we bring to mind

concretely what has been exhibi ted in the interpretation of " phe­
nomenon" and

"logos" we are struck by an inner relation between what

is meant by these terms. The expression "phenomenology" can be for­
m u l a t e d i n G r e e k as legein ta phainomena. B u t legein m e ans
apophainesthai. Hence phenomenology means: apophainesthai ta phain­
omena-to let what shows itself be seen from itself, just as it shows itself
from itself. That is the formal meaning of the type of research that calls
its elf "phenomenology. " But this expresses nothing o ther than the
maxim formulated above: "To the things themselves ! "
Accordingly, the term "phenomenology" differs i n meaning from
such expressions as "theology" and the like. Such titles designate the
obj ects of the respective disciplines in terms of their content. " Phe­
nomenology" neither designates the obj ect of its researches nor is it a
title that describes their content. The word only tells us something about

35

the how of the demonstration and treatment of what this discipline con­
siders . S cience " of' the phenomena means that it grasps its objects in

such a way

that everything about them to be discussed must be directly

indicated and directly demonstrated. The basically tautological expres­
sion "descriptive phenomenology" has the same sense. Here descrip-

Int. 11

Being and Time

31

tion does not mean a procedure like that of, say, botanical morphol­
ogy. The term rather has the sense of a prohibition, insisting that we
avoid all nondemonstrative determinations. The character of description
itself, the specific sense of the logos, can be established only from the
"material content" ["Sachheit"] of what is "described," that is, of what is
to be brought to scientific determinateness in the way phenomena are
encountered. The meaning of the formal and common concepts of the
phenomenon formally justifies our calling every way of indicating beings
as they show themselves in themselves "phenomenology."
Now what must be taken into account if the formal concept of
phenomenon is to be deformalized to the phenomenological one, and
how does this differ from the common concept? What is it that phe­
nomenology is to "let be seen"? What is it that is to be called "phe­
nomenon" in a distinctive sense? What is it that by its very essence
becomes the necessary theme when we indicate something explicitly? Man­
ifestly it is something that does not show itself initially and for the most
part, something that is concealed, in contrast to what initially and for the
most part does show itself. But at the same time it is something that
essentially belongs to what initially and for the most part shows itself,
indeed in such a way that it constitutes its meaning and ground. *
But what remains concealed in an exceptional sense, or what falls
back and is covered up again, or shows itself only in a distorted way, is
not this or that being but rather, as we have shown in our foregoing
observations, the being of beings. It can be covered up to such a degree
that it is forgotten and the question about it and its meaning altogether
omitted. Thus what demands to become a phenomenon in a distinc­
tive sense, in terms of its most proper content, phenomenology has
taken into its "grasp" thematically as its object.
Phenomenology is the way of access to, and the demonstrative
manner of determination of, what is to become the theme of ontology.
Ontology is possible only as phenomenology. The phenomenological con­
cept of phenomenon, as self-showing, means the being of beings-its
meaning, modifications, and derivatives. This self-showing is nothing
arbitrary, nor is it something like an appearing. The being of beings
can least of all be something "behind which" something else stands,
something that "does not appear."
Essentially, nothing else stands "behind" the phenomena of phe­
nomenology. Nevertheless, what is to become a phenomenon can be
concealed. And precisely because phenomena are initially and for the
most part not given phenomenology is needed. Being covered up is the
counterconcept to "phenomenon."
* Truth o f being.

36

32

Int. 11

There are various ways phenomena can be covered up. In the first
place, a phenomenon can be covered up in the sense that it is still com­
pletely

undiscovered.

There is neither knowledge nor lack of knowledge

about it. In the second place, a phenomenon can be

buried over.

This

means it was once discovered but then got covered up again. This cover­
ing up can be total, but more commonly, what was once discovered may
still be visible, though only as semblance. However, where there is sem­
blance there is "being." This kind of covering up, "distortion," is the most
frequent and the most dangerous kind because here the possibilities of
being deceived and misled are especiall y pertinacious. Within a "system"
the structures and concepts of being that are available but concealed with
respect to their autochthony may perhaps claim their rights. On the basis
of their integrated structure in a system they present themselves as some­
thing "dear" which is in no need of further justification and which there­
fore can serve as a point of departure for a process of deduction.
The covering up itself, whether it be understood in the sense of
concealment, being buried over, or distortion, has in turn a twofold
possibility. There are accidental coverings and necessary ones, the latter
grounded in the enduring nature of the di.scovered. It is possible for
every phenomenological concept and proposition drawn from genuine
origins to degenerate when communicated as a statement. It gets circu­
lated in a vacuous fashion, loses its autochthony, and becomes a free­
floating thesis. Even in the concrete work of phenomenology lurks pos­
sible inflexibility and the inability to grasp what was originally "grasped."
And the difficulty of this research consists precisely in making it self-crit­
ical in a positive sense.
The way of encountering being and the structures of being in the
mode of phenomenon must first be

wrested from the obj ects of phe­
of departure of the analysis, the access to the
and passage through the prevalent coverings must secure

nomenology. Thus the point

37

their own method. The idea of an "originary" and "intuitive" grasp and
explication of phenomena must be opposed to the naivete of an acci­
dental, "immediate," and unreflective "beholding."
On the basis of the preliminary concept of phenomenology j ust
delimited, the terms "phenomenal" and "phenomenological" can now be
given fixed meanings. What is given and is explicable in the way we
encounter the phenomenon is call ed "phenomenal." In this sense we
speak of phenomenal structures. Everything that belongs to the mann er
of indication and explication, and constitutes the conceptual tools this
research requires, is call ed "phenomenological."
Because phenomenon in the phenomenological understanding is
always just what constitutes being, and furthermore because being is

Int.

II

Being and Time

33

always the being of beings, we must first of all bring beings themselves
forward in the right way if we are to have any prospect of exposing
being. These beings must likewise show themselves in the way of access
that genuinely belong to them. Thus the common concept of phe­
nomenon becomes phenomenologically relevant. The preliminary task
of a "phenomenological" securing of that being which is to serve as our
example, as the point of departure for the analysis proper, is always
already prescribed by the goal of this analysis.
As far as content goes, phenomenology is the science of the being
of beings-ontology. In our elucidation of the tasks of ontology the
necessity arose for a fundamental ontology which would have as its
theme that being which is ontologically and ontically distinctive, namely,
Da-sein. This must be done in such a way that our ontology confronts
the cardinal problem, the question of the meaning of being in general.*
From the investigation itself we shall see that the methodological meaning of phenomenological description is interpretation. The logos of the
phenomenology of Da-sein has the character of hermeneuein, through
which the proper meaning of being and the basic structures of the very
being of Da-sein are made known to the understanding of being that
belongs to Da-sein itself. Phenomenology of Da-sein is hermeneutics in the
original signification of that word, which designates the work of inter­
pretation. But since discovery of the meaning of being and of the basic
structures of Da-sein in general exhibits the horizon for every further
ontological research into beings unlike Da-sein, the present hermeneutic
is at the same time "hermeneutics" in the sense that it works out the con­
ditions of the possibility of every ontological investigation. Finally, since
Da-sein has ontological priority over all other beings-as a being in the
possibility of existence [Existenz]-hermeneutics, as the interpretation
of the being of Da-sein, receives a specific third and, philosophically
understood, primary meaning of an analysis of the existentiality of exis­
tence. To the extent that this hermeneutic elaborates the historicity of
Da-sein ontologically as the ontic condition of the possibility of the dis­
cipline of history, it contains the roots of what can be called "hermeneutics" only in a derivative sense: the methodology of the historical humanistic disciplines.
As the fundamental theme of philosophy being is not a genus of
beings; yet it pertains to every being. Its "universality" must be sought in
a higher sphere. Being and its structure transcend every being and every
possible existent determination of a being. Being is the transcendens pure
* being-not a genus, not being for beings generally; the "in general"=katholou•as
the whole of:

being of beings;

meaning of difference.

38

34

Being and Time

Int. 1 1

trans cendence of the being of Da-sein is a distinctive
one since in it lies the possibility and necessity of the most radical indi·
viduation. Every disclosure of being as the trarucendens is trarucendental
knowledge. Phenomenological truth (disclosedness of being) is veritas tran­
scendentalis.
Ontology and phenomenology are not two different disciplines
which among others belong to philosophy. Both terms characterize phi­
losophy itself, its object and procedure. Philosophy is universal phe­
nomenological ontology, taking its departure from the hermeneutic of
Da-sein, which, as an analysis of existence, t has fastened the end of the
guideline of all philosophical inquiry at the point from which it arises and
to which it returns.
The following investigations would not have been possible without
the foundation laid by Edmund Husserl; with his Logical Investigatioru
phenomenology achieved a breakthrough. Our elucidations of the pre­
liminary concept of phenomenology show that its essential character
does not consist in its actuality as a philosophical "movement." t Higher
than actuality stands possibility. We can understand phenomenology
solely by seizing upon it as a possibility.5
With regard to the awkwardness and "inelegance" of expression in
the following analyses, we may remark that it is one thing to report narratively about beings and another to grasp beings in their being. For the
latter task not only most of the words are lacking but above all the
"grammar." If we may allude to earlier and in their own right altogether
incomparable researches on the analysis of being, then we should com­
pare the ontological sections in Plato's Parmenides or the fourth chapter
of the seventh book of Aristotle's Metaphysics with a narrative passage
from Thucydides. Then we can see the stunning character of the for­
mulations with which their philosophers challenged the Greeks. Since
our powers are essentially inferior, and also since the area of being to be
disclosed ontologically is far more difficult than that presented to the
Greeks, the complexity of our concept-formation and the severity of
our expression will increase.

8. The Outline of the Treatise
The question of the meaning of being is the most universal and the
emptiest. But at the same time the possibility inheres of its most acute
individualization in each particular Da-sein. * If we are to gain the fun­
damental concept of "being" and the prescription of the ontologically
requisite conceptuality in all its necessary variations, we need a con­
crete guideline. The "special character" of the investigation does not
belie the universality of the concept of being. For we may advance to
being by way of a special interpretation of a particular being, Da-sein, in
which the horizon for an understanding and a possible interpretation of
being is to be won. But his being is in itself "historic, " so that its most
proper ontological illumination necessarily becomes a "historical" inter­
pretation.
The elaboration of the question of being is a two-pronged task; our
treatise therefore has two divisions.

DIVISION ONE

The Preparatory Fundamental
Analysis of Da-sein

What is primarily interrogated in the question of the meaning of being is
that being which has the character of Da-sein. In keeping with i ts uniqu�
ness, the preparatory existential analytic of Da-sein itself needs a prefig­
urative exposition and delimitation from investigations which seem to
run parallel (chapter

1).

Bearing in mind the point of departure of the

investigation, we must analyze a fundamental structure of Da-sein: being­
in-th�world (chapter

II). This "a primi" of the interpretation of Da-sein is

not a structure which is pieced together, but rather a structure which is
primordially and constantly whole. It grants various perspectives on the
factors which constitute it. These factors are to be kept constantly in

view,

bearing in mind the preceding whole of this structure. Thus, we

have as the object of our analysis: the world in its worldliness (chapter

III),

being-in-the-world as being a self and being with others ( chapter

IV), being-in as such (chapter V). On the foundation of the analysis of this
fundamental structure, a preliminary demonstration of the being of Dasein is possible. Its existential meaning is

The being whose analysis our

is always we* ourselves. The being

of this b eing is always mine. In the being of this being it is related to its
b eing. t As the being of this being, it is entrusted to its own being. It is
b eingt about which this being is concerned. From this characteristic of
Da-sein two things follow:

The "essence" of this being lies in its to be. § The whatness

of this being must be understood in terms of its being

insofar as one can speak of it at all . Here the ontological

(essen·
(existentia)

task is precisely

to show that when we choose the word existence for the being of this
being, this term does not and cannot have the ontological meaning of
the traditional expression of existentia. Ontologically, existentia means
objective presence [ Vorhandenheit], a kind of being which is essentially inap­
propriate to characterize the being which has the character of Da-sein.
We can avoid confusion by always using the interpretive expression

objective presence [Vorhandenheit]

for the term

existentia,

and by attributing

existence as a determination of being only to Da-sein.

1.1

The "essence " of Da-sein lies in its existence. The characteristics to be
found in this being are thus not objectively present "attributes" of an
objectively present being which has such and such an "outward appear­
ance," but rather possible ways for it to be, and only this. The thatness of
this being is primarily being. Thus the term "Da-sein" which we use to
designate this being does not express its what, as in the case of table,
house, tree, but being.*
2. The being which this being is concerned about in its being is
always my own. Thus, Da-sein is never to be understood ontologically as
a case and instance of a genus of beings as objectively present. To some­
thing objectively present its being is a matter of "indifference," more pre­
cisely, it "is" in such a way that its being can neither be indifferent nor
non-indifferent to it. In accordance with the character of always-being-my­
own-being (femeinigkeit], when we speak of Da-sein, we must always use
the personal pronoun along with whatever we say: "I am," "You are." t
Da-sein is my own, to be always in this or that way. It has somehow
always already decided in which way Da-sein is always my own. The
being which is concerned in its being about its being is related to its
being as its truest possibility. Da-sein is always its possibility. It does not
"have" that possibility only as a mere attribute of something objectively
present. And because Da-sein is always essentially its possibility, it can
"choose" itself in its being, it can win itself, it can lose itself, or it can
never and only "apparently" win itself. It can only have lost itself and it
can only have not yet gained itself because it is essentially possible as
authentic, that is, it belongs to itself. The two kinds of being of authen­
ticity and inauthenticity-these expressions are terminologically chosen in
the strictest sense of the word-are based on the fact that Da-sein is in
general determined by always being-mine. But the inauthenticity of Da­
sein does not signify a " lesser" being or a "lower" degree of being.
Rather, inauthenticity can determine Da-sein even in its fullest concre­
tion, when it is busy, excited, interested, and capable of pleasure.
The two characteristics of Da-sein sketched out-on the one hand,
the priority of "existentia" over essentia, and then, always-being-mine­
already show that an analytic of this being is confronted with a unique
phenomenal region. This being does not and never has the kind of
being of what is merely objectively present within the world. Thus, it is
also not to be thematically found in the manner of coming across some­
thing objectively present. The correct presentation of it is so little a
matter of course that its determination itself constitutes an essential
part of the ontological analytic of this being. The possibility of under* The Being "of' the There, "of' : genitivus objectivus.

standing the being o f thi s being stands and falls with the secure accom­
plishment of the correct presentation of this being. No matter how pro­
visional the analysis may be, it always demands the securing of the cor­
rect beginning.
As a being, Da-sein always defines itself in terms of a possibility
which it

is

and somehow understands in its being. That is the formal

meaning of the constitution of the existence of Da-sein. But for the

logical interpretation of this being,

onto­

this means that the problematic of its

being* is to be developed out of the existentiality of its existence. How­
ever, this cannot mean that Da-sein is to be construed in terms of a con­
crete possible idea of existence. At the beginning of the analysis, Da-sein
is precisely not to be interpreted in the differentiation of a particular
existence; rather, to be uncovered in the indifferent way in which it is ini­
tially and for the most part. This indifference of the everydayness of
Da-sein is

not nothing;

but rather, a positive phenomenal characteristic.

All existing is how it is out of this kind of being, and back into it. We call
this everyday indifference of Da-sein

averageness.

And because average everydayness constitutes the ontic immediacy
of this being, it was and will be passed

over again and again in

the expli­

cation of Da-sein. What is ontically nearest and familiar is ontologically
the farthest, unrecognized and constantly overlooked in its ontological
significance. Augustine asks: "Quid autem propinquius

meipso mihi'f' ("But
"Ego certe laboro hie
et laboro in meipso: Jactus sum mihi terra difficultatis et sudoris nimii. "

what is closer to me than myself?") And must answer:
(Assuredly

I

labor here and I labor within myself:

I

have become to

myself a land of trouble and inordinate sweat"}} This holds true not
only for the ontic and preontological opacity of Da-sein, but to a still
higher degree for the ontological task of not only not failing to see this
being in its phenomenally nearest kind of being, but of making it acces­
sible in its positive characteristics.
But the average everydayness of Da-sein must not be understood
as a mere "aspect. " In it, too, and even in the mode of inauthenticity,
the structure of existentiality lies

a priori.

In it, too, Da-sein is con­

cerned with a particular mode of its being to which it is related in the
way of average everydayness, if only in the way of fleeing .from it and of
forgetting

it.

The explication of Da-sein in its average everydayness, however, does
not just give average structures in the sense of a vague indeterminacy. What

is

ontically in the way of being average can very well be understood onto­

logically in terms of pregnant structures which are not structurally different

* better: of its understanding of being

42

1.1

from the ontological detenninations of an authentic being of Da-sein.

All explications arising from an analytic of Da-sein are gained with
a view toward its structure of existence. Because these explications are
defined in terms of existentiality, we shall call the characteristics of being
of Da-sein

existentials.

They are to be sharply delimited from the deter­

minations of being of those beings unlike Da-sein which we call categories.
This expression is taken and retained in its primary ontological signifi­
cation. As the exemplary basis of its interpretation of being, ancient
ontology takes the beings which we encounter within the world. Noein or

logos was regarded as the manner of access to those beings.

It is there that

beings are encountered. The being of these beings, however, must
become comprehensible in a distinctive

kgein (a letting be seen),

so that

this being is comprehensible from the very beginning as what it is and
already is in every being. In the discussion

( logos)

of beings, we have

always previously addressed ourselves to being; this addressing is

goreisthai. That means,

kate­

first of all: to accuse publicly, to say something to

someone directly and in front of everyone. Used ontologically, the term
means: to say something to a being, so to speak, right in the face, to say
what it always already is as a being; that is, to let it be seen for everyone in

45

its being. What is caught sight of in such seeing and what becomes visible
are the

kategoriai. They include the a priori detenninations of the beings
logos in different ways.

which can be addressed and spoken about in the

Existentil'ls and categories are the two fundamental possibilities of the
charactet ;sties of being. The being which corresponds to them requires
different ways of primary interrogation. Beings are a

who

(existence) or

else a what (obj ective presence in the broadest sense). It is only in terms
of the clarified horizon of the question of being that we can treat the con­
nection between the two modes of characteristics of being.
We intimated in the introduction that a task is furthered in the
existential analytic of Da-sein, a task whose urgency is hardly less than
that of the question of being itself: the exposition of the

a priori

which

must be visible if the question "What is human being?" is to be dis­
cussed philosophically. The existential analytic of Da-sein is prior to any
psychology, anthropology, and especially biology. By being delimited
from these possible investigations of Da-sein, the theme of the analytic
can become s till more sharply defined. Its necessity can thus at the same
time be demonstrated more incisively.

10. How the Analytic of Da-sein is to be Distinguished

from Anthropology, Psychology, and Biology
After a theme for investigation has been initially outlined in positive
terms, it is always important to show what is to be ruled out, although it

I. J

Being and Time

43

can easily become unfruitful to discuss what is not going to happen.
We must show that all previous questions and inves tigations * which
aim at Da-sein fail to see the real

philosophical

problem, regardless of

their factual productivity. Thus, as long as they persist in this attitude,
they may not claim to

be able to accomplish what they are fundamentally

s triving for at all. In dis tinguishing existential analytic from anthropol­
o gy, psychology, and biology, we shall confine ourselves to what is in
principle the fundamental ontological question. Thus, our distinctions
will be of necessity inadequate for a " theory of science" simply because
the scientific structure of the above-mentioned disciplines (not the "sci­
entific attitude" of those who are working to further them) has today
become completely questionable and needs new impulses which must
arise from the ontological problematic.
Historiographically, the intention of the existential analytic can
be clarified by considering Descartes, to whom one attributes the discovery of the

cogito sum

as the point of departure for all modern philo­

cogitare

sophical questioning. He investigates the

of the

ego

within cer-

-

tain limits. But the sum he leaves completely undiscussed, even though it
is just as primordial as the
question of the being of the
manner of the

cogito. Our analytic raises the ontological
sum. Only when the sum is defined does the

cogitationes become

comprehensible.

At the same time, it is of course misleading to exemplify the inten­
tion of the analytic historiographically in this way. One of our first tasks

will be to show that the point of departure from an initially given ego and
subject totally fails to see the phenomenal content of Da-sein. Every
idea of a "subj ect"-unless refined by a previous ontological determina­
tion of its basic character-still posits the

logically

subjectum (hupokeimenon) onto­

along with it, no matter how energetic one' s ontic protestations

against the "substantial soul" or the "reification of consciousness." Thing­
liness itself needs to be demonstrated in terms of its ontological source
in order that we can ask what is now to be understood positively by the
nonreified

being

of the subj ect, the soul, consciousness, the spirit, the

person. All these terms name definite areas of phenomena which can be
"developed. " But they are never used without a remarkable failure to see
the need for inquiring about the being of the beings so designated.
Thus we are not being terminologically idiosyncratic when we avoid
these terms as well as the expressions "life" and "human being" in des­
ignating the beings that we ourselves are.
On the other hand, if we understand it correctly, in any serious
and scientifically minded "philosophy of life" ( this expression says about

* They did not aim at Da-sein at all.

46

44

47

48

Being

and Time

1.1

as much as the "botany of plants" ) there lies an inexplicit tendency
toward understanding the being of Da-sein. * What strikes us first of all
in such a philosophy (and this is its fundamental lack)t is that "life" itself
as a kind of being does not become a problem ontologically.
W. Dilthey's investigations are motivated and sustained by the
perennial question of "life." Starting from "life" itself as a whole, he
attempts to understand its "experiences" in their structural and devel­
opmental interconnections. What is philosophically relevant about his
"humanistic psychology" is not to be found in the fact that it is no longer
oriented toward psychic elements and atoms and no longer tries to
piece together the life of the soul, but rather aims at the "whole of life"
and "gestalt." Rather, it is to be found in the fact that in the midst of all
this he was, above all, on the way to the question of "life." It is true that
we can see here very plainly the limits of his problematic and of the set
of concepts with which it had to be expressed. But along with Dilthey
and Bergson, all the directions of "personalism" and all tendencies
toward a philosophical anthropology influenced by them share these
limits. The phenomenological interpretation of personality is in princi­
ple more radical and transparent; but it does not reach the dimension of
the question of being in Da-sein, either. Despite all their differences in
questioning, development, and orientation of their worldviews, the inter­
pretations of personality found in Husserl2 and Scheler agree in what is
negative. They no longer ask the question about the "being of the per­
son. " We choose Scheler's interpretation as an example, not only
because it is accessible in print,' but because he explicitly emphasizes the
being of the person as such, and attempts to define it by defining the
specific being of acts as opposed to everything "psychical." According to
Scheler, the person can never be thought as a thing or a substance.
Rather it is "the immediately co-experienced unity of ex-periencing-not
just a thing merely thought behind and outside of what is immediately
experienced. "4 The person is not a thinglike substantial being. Further­
more, the being of the person cannot consist in being a subject of ratio­
nal acts that have a certain lawfulness.
The person is not a thing, not a substance, not an object. Here
Scheler emphasizes the same thing which HusserP is getting at when
he requires for the unity of the person a constitution essentially different
from that of things of nature. What Scheler says of the person, he
applies to acts as well. "An act is never also an object, for it is the nature
of the being of acts only to be experienced in the process itself and
given in reflection. "6 Acts are nonpsychical. Essentially the person exists
* no!
Not only that, but the question of truth is totally an d essentially inadequate.

t

I. I

Being and Time

45

only in carrying out intentional acts, and is thus essentially not an object.
Every psychical objectification, and thus every comprehension of acts as
something psychical, is identical with depersonalization. In any case,
the person is given as the agent of intentional acts which are connected
by the unity of a meaning. Thus psychical being has nothing to do with
being a person. Acts are carried out, the person carries them out. But
what is the ontological meaning of "carrying out," how is the kind of
being of the person to be defined in an ontologically positive way? But
the critical question cannot stop at this. The question is about the being
of the whole human being, whom one is accustomed to understand as a
bodily-soul-like-spiritual unity. Body, soul, spirit might designate areas of
phenomena which are thematically separable for the sake of determinate
investigations; within certain limits their ontological indeterminancy
might not be so important. But in the question of the being of human
being, this cannot be summarily calculated in terms of the kinds of
being of body, soul, and spirit which have yet first to be defined. And
even for an ontological attempt which is to proceed in this way, some
idea of the being of the whole would have to be presupposed. But what
obstructs or misleads the basic question of the being of Da-sein is the ori­
entation thoroughly colored by the anthropology of Christianity and
the ancient world, whose inadequate ontological foundations personal­
ism and the philosophy of life also ignore. Traditional anthropology
contains the following:

1 . The definition of human being: zoon logon echon in the interpreta­
tion: animal rationale, rational life. The kind of being of the zoon,
however, is understood here in the sense of occurring and being
objectively present. The logos is a higher endowment whose kind of
being remains just as obscure as that of the being so pieced together.
2. The other guideline for the determination of the being and essence of
human being is a theological one: kai eipen ho theos. Po�amen anthri)jJon
kat ' eikona hemeteran kai kath ' homoiasin; faciamu.s hominem ad imaginem nostram et similitudinem nostram.7 From this, Christian theological
anthropology, taking over the ancient definition, gets an interpretation of the being we call human being. But just as the being of God is
ontologically interpreted by means of ancient ontology, so is the
being of the ens ftnitum, to an even greater extent. The Christian def­
inition was de-theologized in the course of the modem period. But
the idea of " transcendence" -that human being is something that
goes beyond itself-has its roots in Christian dogma, which can hardly
be said to have ever made an ontological problem of the being of
human being. This idea of transcendence, according to which the
human being is more than a rational being, has elaborated itself in

49

46

I. I

Being and Time

various transformations. We can illustrate its origin with the following
quotations : "His praeclaris dotibus excelluit prima hominis conditio, ut
ratio, intelligentia, prudentia, iudicium, non modo ad terrenae vitae guber­
nationem suppeterent, sed quibus transcenderet usque ad Deum et aeternam
Jelititatem."8 "For the fact that human being looks toward God and His
word clearly shows that according to his nature he is born closer to
God, is more

similar

to God, is somehow

drawn toward

God, that

without doubt everything flows from the fact that he is created in
the

image

of God."9

The sources which are relevant for traditional anthropology­
the Greek definition and the theological guideline-indicate that, over
and above the attempt to determine the essence of "human being" as
a being, the question of its b eing has remained forgotten; rather, this
b eing is unders too d as something "self-evident" in the sense of the

objective

presence of other created things . These two guidelines inter­

twine in modern anthropology, where the

res cogitans,

consciousness ,

and the context of experience, serve as the methodical point of depar­
ture . But since these

cogitationes are

also ontologically undetermined,

or are again i nexplici tly and " s elf-evidently" taken as s o m e thing
"given" whose "being" is not a matter of question, the anthropological
problemati c remains undetermined in i ts decisive ontological foun­
dation.
This is no less true of "psychology," whose anthropological tenden­
cies are unmistakable today. Nor can the missing ontological founda­
tions be replaced by building anthropology and psychology into a gen­
eral

50

biology.

In the order of possible understanding and interpretation,

biology as the "science of life" is rooted in the ontology of Da-sein,
although not exclusively in it. Life has its own kind of being, but it is
essentially accessible only in Da-sein. The ontology of life takes place by
way of a privative interpretation. It determines what must be the case if
there can be anything like just-being-alive. Life is neither pure objec­
tive presence, nor is it Da-sein. On the other hand, Da-sein should never
be defined ontologically by regarding it as life-( ontologically undeter­
mined) and then as something else on top of that.
In suggesting that anthropology, psychology, and biology all fail to
give an unequivocal and ontologically adequate answer to the question
of the

kind of being

of this being that we ourselves are, no judgment is

being made about the positive work of these disciplines. But, on the
o ther hand, we must continually be conscious of the fact that these
ontological foundations can never be disclosed by subsequent hypothe­
ses derived from empirical material . Rather, they are always already
" there" even when that empirical material is only

collected.

The fact that

Being and Time

I. I

47

po siti vistic investigation does not see these foundations and considers
th em to be self-evident is no proof of the fact that they do not lie at the
basis and are problematic in a more radical sense than any thesis of
10
positivistic science can ever be.

1 1. The Existential Analytic and the Interpretation

of Primitive Da-sein: The Difficulties in
Securing a "Natural Concept of the World "
The interpretation of Da-sein in its everydayness, however, is not iden­
tical with describing a primitive stage of Da-sein, with which we can
become acquainted empirically through the medium of anthropology.

Everydayness is not the same thing as primitiveness.

Rather, everydayness is

also and precisely a kind of being of Da-sein, even when Da-sein moves
in a highly developed and differentiated culture. On the other hand,
primitive Da-sein also has

its

51

possibility of noneveryday being, and i t

h a s i t s own specific everydayness. To orient the analysis of D a-sein
toward " the life of primitive peoples" can have a positive methodical
significance in that " primitive phenomena" are often less hidden and
complicated by extensive self-interpretation on the part of the Da-sein in
question. Primitive Da-sein often speaks out of a more primordial
absorption in "phenomena" (in the pre-phenomenological sense). The
conceptuality which appears to be clumsy and crude to us can be of
use positively for a genuine elaboration of the ontological structures of
phenomena.
But up until now our information about primitive peoples has
been provided by ethnology. And ethnology already moves in certain
preliminary concepts and interpretations of human being in general,
beginning with the initial " collection" of its materials, its findings and
elaborations . We do not know whether commonplace psychology or
even scientific psychology and sociology, which the ethnologist beings
with him, offer any scientific guarantee for an adequate possibility of
access, interpretation, and mediation of the phenomena to be investi­
gated. The situation here is the same as with the disciplines mentioned
before . Ethnology its elf already presupposes an adequate analytic of
Da-sein as its guideline. But since the positivistic sciences neither " can"
nor should wait for the ontological work of philosophy, the continuation
of research will not be accomplished

Although the formal differentiation of th e ontological problematic

task: the development of the idea of a "natural concept of the

The wealth of knowledge of the most exotic and manifold cul­

tures and forms of existence available today seems favorable to taking up
this task in a fruitful way. But that is only an ill usion. Fundamentally, this
plethora of information seduces us into failing to see the real problem.
The syncretistic comparison and classification of everything does not of
itself give us genuine ess ential knowledge. Subj ecting the manifold to
tabulation does not guarantee a real understanding of what has been
ordered. The genuine principle of order has its own content which is
never found by ordering, but is rather already presupposed in ordering.
Thus the explicit idea of world as such is a prerequisite for the order of
world images. And if "world" itself is constitutive of Da-sein, the con­
ceptual development of the phenomenon of world requires an insight
into the fundamental structures of Da-sein.
The positive characteristics and negative considerations of this
chapter aimed at directing the understanding of the tendency and ques­
tion of the following interpretation to the right path. Ontology can only
contribute indirectly to the furtherance of existing positivistic disci­
plines. It has a goal of its own, provided that the question of being is the
spur for all scientific search over and above the acquisition of informa­
tion about beings.

* Not at all! The concept of world is not understood at all.

II

Being-in-the-World in General as the
Fundamental Constitution of Da-sein

12. A Preliminary Sketch of Being-in-the-World in Terms
of the Orientation toward Being-in as Such
In the preparatory discussions (section

9) we already proflled charac­

teristics of being which are to provide us with a steady light for our further investigation, but which at the same time receive their structural
concretion in this investigation. Da-sein is a being which is related unders tandingly in its being toward that being. In saying this we are calling
attention to the formal concept of existence. Da-sein exists . Further­
more, Da-sein is the being which I myself always am. Mineness belongs
to existing Da-sein as the condition of the possibility of authenticity and
inauthenticity. Da-sein exists always in one of these modes, or else in the
modal indifference to them.
These determinations of being of Da-sein, however, must now be

a priori as grounded upon that constitution of
being-in-the-world. The correct point of departure of

s een and understood
being which we call

the analytic of Da-sein consists in the interpretation of this constitution.
The compound expression "being-in-the-world" indicates, in the
very way we have coined it, that it stands for a

unifzed

phenomenon.

This primary datum must be seen as a whole. But while being-in-the­
world canno t be b roken up into components that may be pieced
together, this does not prevent it from having several constitutive struc­
tural factors. The phenomenal fact indicated by this expression actu-

49

53

50

Being and Time

1.11

ally gives us a threefold perspective. If we pursue it while keeping the
whole phenomenon in mind from the outset we have the following:

1.

"In-the-world" :

In relation to this factor, we have the task of questioning

the ontological structure of "world" and of defining the idea of world­

liness as such ( cf. chapter 3 of this division).
2. The being which always is in the way of being-in-the-world.

In it we are

looking for what we are questioning when we ask about the "who?".
In our phenomenological demonstration we should be able to deter­
mine who is in the mode of average everydayness of Da-sein (cf. chap­
ter 4 of this division) .

3 . Being in as such: The ontological constitution of in-ness itself is t o b e
analyzed ( cf. chapter 5 of this division). An y analysis of one of these
constitutive factors involves the analysis of the others; that is, each
time s eeing the whole phenomenon. It is true that being-in-the-world
is an

a

priori necessary

constitution of Da-sein, but it is not at all suf­

ficient to fully determine Da-sein's being. Before we thematically ana­
lyze the three phenomena indicated individually, we shall attempt to
orient ourselves toward a characteristic of the third of these consti­
tutive factors .
What does

being-in

mean? Initially, we supplement the expression

being-in with the phrase "in the world, " and are inclined to understand

54

this being-in as "being-in something. " With this term, the kind of being
of a being is named which is "in" something else, as water is "in" the
glass, the dress is "in" the closet. By this "in" we mean the relation of
being that two b eings extended "in" space have to each other with
regard to their location in that space. Water and glass, dress and closet,
are both "in" space "at" a location in the same way. This relation of
being can be expanded; that is, the bench in the lecture hall, the lecture
hall in the university, the universi ty in the city, and so on until : the
bench in "world space. " These b eings whose being "in" one another
can be determined in this way all have the same kind of being-that of
being objectively present-as things occurring "within" the world. The
objective presence "in" something objectively present, the being objec­
tively present together with something having the same kind of being in
the sense of a definite location relationship are ontological characteris­
tics which we call

categorial.

They belong to beings whose kind of being

is unlike Da-sein.
In contrast, being-in designates a constitution of being of Dasein,
and is an

existential.

But we cannot understand by this the obj ective

presence of a material thing ( the human body) "in" a being objectively
present. Nor does the term being-in designate a spatial "in one another"

something familiar in such and such a way. Being* as the infinitive of "I

familiar with . . . .

being of Da-seint

Being-in is thus the formal existential expression of the

which has the essential constitution of being-in the­

world.
"Being together with" the world, in the sense of being absorbed in
the world, which must be further interpreted, is an existential which is
grounded in being-in. Because we are concerned in these analyses with

seeing

a primordial structure of being of Da-sein in accordance with

whose phenomenal content the concepts of being must be articulated,
and because this structure is fundamentally incomprehensible in terms
of the traditional ontological categories, this "being together with" must
also be examined more closely. We shall again choose the method of
contrasting i t with something essentially ontologically different-that is,
a categorical relation of being which we express linguistically with the
same means . Fundamental ontological distinctions are easily obliterated; and if they are to be envisaged phenomenally in this way, this
must be done

explicitly,

even at the risk of discussing something "obvi-

ous . " The status of the ontological analytic, however, shows that we do
not at all have these "obvious" matters adequately "in our grasp, " still
less have we interpreted them in the meaning of their being; and we are
even farther from possessing the proper structural concepts in a secure
form.
As an existential, "being with" the world never means anything
like the b eing-objectively-present-together of things that occur. There is
no such thing as the "being next to each other" of a being called "Da­
sein" with another being called "world." It is true that, at times, we are
accus tomed to express linguistically the being together of two objec­
tively present things in such a manner: "The table stands 'next to' the
door, " "The chair ' touches' the wall." Strictly speaking, we can never
talk about " touching, " not because in the last analysis we can always
find a space between the chair and the wall by examining it more closely,
but because in principle the chair can never touch the wall, even if the

* "To be" is also the infinitive of the "is": a being is.
But not of being in general and not at all of being itself-absolutely.

t

I.n

space between them amounted to nothing. The presupposition for this
would be that the wall could be encountered "by" the chair. A being can
only touch an objectively present being within the world if it funda­
mentally has the kind of being of being-in-only if with its Da-sein some­
thing like world is already discovered in terms of which beings can
reveal themselves through touch and thus become accessible in their
objective presence. Two beings which are objectively present within the
world and are, moreover, worldless in themselves, can never "touch"
each other, neither can "be" "together with" the other. The supplement
"which are moreover worldless" must not be left out, because those
beings which are not worldless, for example Da-sein itself, are objec­
tively present "in" the world, too. More precisely, they can be understood
within certain limits and with a certain justification as something merely
objectively present. To do this, one must completely disregard or just
not see the existential constitution of being-in. But with this possible
understanding of " Da-sein" as something objectively present, and only
objectively present, we may not attribute to Da-sein its own kind of
"objective presence." This objective presence does not become accessible
by disregarding the specific structures of Da-sein, but only in a previous
understanding of them. Da-sein understands its ownmost being in the
sense of a certain "factual objective presence. "2 And yet the "factuality"
of the fact of one's own Da-sein is ontologically totally different from the
factual occurrence of a kind of stone. The factuality of the fact Da-sein,
as the way in which every Da-sein actually is, we call its facticity. The
complicated structure of this determination of being is itself compre­
hensible as a problem only in the light of the existential fundamental
constitutions of Da-sein which we have already worked out. The concept
of facticity implies that an "innetworldly" being has being-in-the-world in
such a way that it can understand itself as bound up in its "destiny"
with the being of those beings which it encounters within its own world.
Initially it is only a matter of seeing the ontological distinction
between being-in as an existential and the category of the "insideness"
that things objectively present can have with regard to one another. If we
define being-in in this way, we are not denying to Da-sein every kind of
"spatiality." On the contrary. Da-sein itself has its own "being-in-space,"
which in its tum is possible only on the basis of being-in-the-world in general.
Thus, being-in canno t be clarified ontologically by an ontic characteristic,
by saying for example: being-in in a world is a spiritual quality and the
"spatiality" of human being is an attribute of its bodiliness which is always
at the same time "based on" corporeality. Then we again have to do with
a being-objectively-present-together of a spiritual thing thus constituted
with a corporeal thing, and the being of the beings thus compounded is
more obscure than ever. The understanding of being-in-the-world as an

Being and Time

1.11

53

essential structure of Da-sein first makes possible the insight into its

existential spatiality.

This insight will keep us from failing to see this

structure or from previously cancelling it out, a procedure motivated not
ontologically, but "metaphysically" in the naive opinion that human
being is initially a spiritual thing which is then subsequently placed "in"
a space.
With its facticity, the being-in-the-world of Da-sein is already dis­
persed in definite ways of being-in, perhaps even split up. The multi­
plicity of these kinds of being-in can be indicated by the following examples: to have to do with something, to produce, order and take care of
something, to use something, to give something up and let it get lost, to
undertake, to accomplish, to find out, to ask about, to observe, to speak
about, to determine . . . . These ways of being-in have the kind of being of

taking care of which we

shall characterize in greater detail. The

deficient

modes of omitting, neglecting, renouncing, resting, are also ways of taking care of something, in which the possibilities of taking care are kept
to a "bare minimum." The term "taking care" has initially its prescientific
meaning and can imply: carrying s omething out, settling something,
" to straighten it out." The expression could also mean to take care of
something in the sense of "getting it for oneself." Furthermore, we use
the expression also in a characteristic tum of phrase: I will see to it or
take care that the enterprise fails. Here "to take care" amounts to appre­
hensiveness. In contrast to these prescientific ontic meanings, the expression "taking care" is used in this inquiry as an ontological term (an exis­
tential) to designate the being of a possible being-in-the-world. We do
not choose this term because Da-sein is initially economical and "practical" to a large extent, but because the being of Da-sein its elf is to be
made visible as

care.

Again, this expression is to be understood as an

ontological structure concept (compare chapter

6

of this division). The

expression has nothing to do with "distress," "melancholy," or "the cares
of life" which can be found ontically in every Da-sein. These-like their
opposites, " carefreenes s " and " gai ety"-are onti cally possible only
because Dasein,

ontologically

understood, is care. Because being-in-the­

world belongs essentially to Da-sein, its being toward the world is essentially taking care. *
According to what we have said, being-in is not a "quality" which
Da-sein sometimes has and sometimes does not have,
could

be just

without which

it

as well as it could with it. It is not the case that human

being "is," and then on top of that has a relation of being to the "world"
which it sometimes takes upon itself. Da-sein is never "initially" a sort of

57

Being and Time

54

1.11

a being which is free from being-in, but which at times is in the mood to
take up a "relation" to the world. This taking up of relations to the
world is possible only

because,

as being-in-the-world, Da-sein is as it is.

This constitution of being is not first derived from the fact that besides
the being which has the character of Da-sein there are other b eings
which are obj ectively present and meet up with it. These other beings
can only "meet up" "with" Da-sein because they are able to show them­
selves of their own accord within a

world.

The saying used so often today "Human beings have their envi­
ronment" does not say anything ontologically as long as this "having" is
undetermined. In its very possibility this "having" has its foundation in

58

th e existential constitution o f being-in. As a being essentially existing i n
this way, Da-sein can explicitly discover beings which it encounters in
the environment, can know about them, can avail itself of them, can

have

"world." The ontically trivial talk about "having an environment" is

ontologically a problem. To solve it requires nothing less than defining
the being of Da-sein beforehand in an ontologically adequate way. If in
biology use has been made of this constitution of being-especially since
K.

E. von Baer-one must not conclude that its philosophical use implies

"biologism." For as a positive science, biology, too, can never find and
determine this s tructure, it must presuppose it and continually make
use of it. * This structure itself, however, can be explicated philosophically
as the

a priori

condition for the thematic objects of biology only if it is

understood beforehand as a structure of Da-sein. Only in terms of an ori­
entation toward the ontological structure thus understood, can "life" as a
constitution of being be defined

a priori

in a privative way. Ontically, as

well as ontologically, being-in-the-world has priority as taking care. This
structure gets its fundamental interpretation in the analytic of Da-sein.
But does not this determination of the constitution of being dis­
cussed up to now move exclusively in negative statements? Though this
being-in is supposedly so fundamental, we always keep hearing what it is

not.

Indeed. But the prevalence of negative characteristics is no acci­

dent. Rather it makes known what is peculiar to this phenomenon, and
is thus positive in a genuine sens e-a sense appropriate to the phe­
nomenon itself. The phenomenological demonstration of being-in-the­
world has the character of rejecting distortions and obfuscations

because

this phenomenon is always already "seen" in every Da-sein in a certain
way. And that is true

because it makes

up a fundamental constitution of

Da-sein, in that it is always already disclosed, along with its being, for the
understanding of being in Da-sein. But the phenomenon has mostly
*

bung). "Having" corresponds to this "giving." Da-sein never "has" world.

Being and Time

1.11

55

been basically misinterpreted, or interpreted in an ontologically inade­
quate way. * However, this " seeing in a certain way and yet mostly mis­
interpreting" is itself based on nothing other than this constitution of
being of Da-sein itself. In accordance with that constitution, Da-sein
understands itself-and that means also its being-in-the-world-ontologi­
cally in terms of

those

beings and their being which it itself is

not,

but

which it encounters "within" its world.t
B o th in D a-sein and for it, this constitution of being is always
already somehow familiar. If it is now to be recognized, the explicit

cognition

that this task implies takes itself (as a knowing of the world) as

the exemplary relation of the "soul" to the world. The cognition of
world ( noein)-or addressing oneself to the "world" and discussing it
(logos)-thus functions as the primary mode of being-in-the-world even
though being-in-the-world is not understood as such. But because this
s tructure of being remains ontologically inaccessible, yet is ontically
experienced as the "relation" between one being (world) and another
( s oul), and because being is initially unders too d by taking being as
innerworldly beings for one's ontological support, one tries to conceive the relation between world and soul as grounded in these two
beings and in the sense of their being; that is, as objective presence.
Although it is experienced and known prephenomenologically, being­
in-the-world is

invisible if one interprets

it in a way that is ontologically

inadequate. One is just barely acquainted with this constitution of Das e i n only in the form given by an inadequate interpretation-and
indeed, as s omething obvious . In this way it then becomes the " evi­
dent" point of departure for the problems of epis temology or a "meta­
physics of knowledge. " For what is more obvious than the fact that a
"subject" is related to an " object" and the other way around? This "sub­
ject-object-relation" must be presupposed. But that is a presupposition
which, although it is inviolate in its own facticity, is truly fatal, perhaps
for that very reason, if i ts ontological necessity and especially its onto­
logical meaning are left in obscurity.
Thus the phenomenon of being-in has for the most part been rep­
resented exclusively by a single exemplar-knowing the world. This has
not only been the case in epistemology; for even practical behavior has
been understood as behavior which is

not

theoretical and "atheoreti­

cal." Because knowing has been given this priority, our understanding of
its ownmost kind of being is led astray, and thus being-in-the-world must
be delineated more precisely with reference to knowing the world, and
must itself be made visible as an existential "modality" of being-in.

13. The Exemplification of Being-in in a Founded Mode:

Knowing the World
If being-in-the-world is a fundamental constitution of Da-sein, and one in
which it moves not only in general but especially in the mode of every­
dayness, it must always already have been experienced ontically. It would

60

be incomprehensible if it were totally veiled, especially since Da-sein
has an understanding of its own being at its disposal, no matter how
indeterminately that understanding functions. However, no sooner was
the "phenomenon of knowing the world" understood than it was inter­
preted in an " external" formal way. The evidence for this is the inter­
pretation of knowledge, still prevalent today, as a "relation between sub­
ject and obj ect" which contains about as much "truth" as it does vacuity.
But subject and object are not the same as Da-sein and world. *
Even if it were feasible to give an ontological definition of being-in
primarily in terms of being-in-the-world that knows, the first task required
would still be the phenomenal characterization of knowing as a being in
and toward the world. But if one thinks about this relation of being, one
first has a being, call ed nature, as that which is known. Knowing itself is
not �o be found in this being. If knowing "is" at all, it belongs solely to
those beings which know. But even in those beings, the things called
human beings, knowing is not objectively present. In any case, it can not
be as certained externally like corporeal qualities. In that knowing
belongs to these beings and is not an external characteristic, it must be
"inside. " The more unequivocally we bear in mind that knowing is ini­
tially and really " inside," and indeed has by no means the kind of being
of physical and psychic beings, the more we believe that we are pro­
ceeding without presuppositions in the question of the essence of knowl­
edge and of the clarification of the relation between subject and object.
For only then can the problem arise of how this knowing subject comes
out of its inner " sphere" into one that is "other and external," of how
knowing can have an object at

all, and of how the obj ect itself is to be

thought so that eventually the subject knows it without having to venture
a leap into another sphere. But in this approach, which has many varia­
tions, the question of the kind of being of this knowing subject is com­
pletely omitted, though its way of being was always included tacidy in the
theme when we spoke of its knowing. Of course, we are sometimes
assured that the subject's inside and its "inner sphere" is certainly not to
b e thought as a kind of a "box" or " cabinet." But what th e positive
meaning is of the "inside" of immanence in which knowing is initially

* Certainly not. So little that even rejecting this by putting them together is
already fatal.

enclosed, and how the character of being of this "being inside" of know­
ing is founded in the kind of being of the subject, about this there is
silence. However this inner sphere might be interpreted, if one asks
how knowing gets "out" of it and achieves a "transcendence," it becomes
evident that the knowing which presents such enigmas remains prob­
lematical unless one has first clarified how it is and what it is.
With this kind of approach one is blind to what was already implic­
itly implied in the preliminary thematization of the phenomenon of
knowing. Knowing is a mode of being of Da-sein as being-in-the-world,
and has its ontic foundation in this constitution of being. But if, as we
suggest, we thus find phenomenally that

being-in-the-world,

knowing is a kind of being of

one might object that with such an interpretation of

knowing, the problem of knowledge is annihilated. What is there left to
ask about if one

presupposes

that knowing is already together with its

world which it is, after all , flt'St supposed to reach in the transcending of
the subject? Apart from the fact that in the question just formulated, the
" standpoint" -which is again not demonstrated phenomenally but is
rather constructivist-makes its appearance, what criterion then decides

whether and in which sense there

is to be a problem of knowledge other

than that of the phenomenon of knowing itself and the kind of being of
the knower?
If we now ask what shows itself in the phenomenal findings of
knowing, we must remember that knowing itself is grounded before­
hand in already-being-in-the-world which essentially constitutes the being
of Da-sein. Initially , this already-being-with is not solely a rigid staring at
something merely objectively present. Being-in-the-world, as taking care
of things, is

taken in by

the world which it takes care of. In order for

knowing to be possible as determining by observation what is objec­
tively present, there must first be a

deficiency

of having to do with the

world and taking care of it. In refraining from all production, manipu­
lation, and so on, taking care of things places itself in the only mode of
being-in which is left over, in the mode of simply lingering with .

i n d e p e n d e n t dwelling together wi th b e ings in the worl d . In this

62

"dwelling"-as the refusal of every manipulation and use-the perception of
address­
ing and discussing something as something. On the foundation of this
interpretation in the broadest sense, perception becomes definition. What
what is obj ectively present takes place. Perception takes place as

is perceived and defined can be expressed in propositions and as thus

expressed

can be maintained and preserved. This perceptive retention

of a proposition about . . . is itself a way of being-in-the-world, and must
not be interpreted as a "procedure" by which a subj ect gathers repre­
sentations about something for itself which then remain s tored up
"inside" as thus appropriated, and in reference to which the question
can arise at times of how they "correspond" with reality.
In directing itself toward . . . and in grasping something, Da-sein
does not first go outside of the inner sphere in which it is initially encap­
sulated, but, rather, in its primary kind of being, it is always already
" outside" together with some being encountered in the world already
discovered. Nor is any inner sphere abandoned when Da-sein dwells
together with a being to be known and determines its character. Rather,
even in this "being outside" together with its object, Da-sein is "inside, "
correctly understood; that is, it itself exists as the being-in-the-world
which knows . Again, the perception of what is known does not take
place as a return with one's booty to the "cabinet" of consciousness
after one has gone out and grasped it. Rather, in perceiving, preserving,
and retaining, the Da-sein that knows

remains outside as Da-sein.

In "mere"

knowledge about a context of the being of beings, in "only" representing
i t, in "solely" " thinking" about it, I am no less outside in the world

originally

grasp them. Even for­

getting something, when every relation of being to what was previously
known seems to be extinguished, must be understood as

primordial being-in,

a modifuation of

and this holds true for every deception and every

error.
The foundational context s hown for the mode of being-in-the­
world constitutive for the knowledge of the world makes the following
clear: in knowing, Da-sein gains a new

perspective of being

toward the

world always already discovered in Da-sein. This new possibility of being
can be independently developed. It can become a task, and as scientific
knowledge can take over the guidance for being-in-the-world. But know­
ing neither first

creates a

"commercium" of the subject with the world,

nor does this commercium originate from an effect of the world on a sub­
ject. Knowing is a mode of Da-sein which is founded in being-in-the­
world. Thus, being-in-the-world, as a fundamental constitution, requires
a prior interpretation.

III

63

The Worldliness of the World

14. The Idea of the Worldliness of the World in General
First of all, being-in-the-world is to be made visible with regard to the
structural factor "world. " The accomplishment of this task appears to be
easy and so trivial that we still believe we may avoid it. What can it mean,
to describe "the world" as a phenomenon? It means letting what shows
itself in the "beings" within the world be seen. Thus, the first step is to enu­
merate the things which are "in" the world: houses, trees, people, moun­
tains, stars. We can

tell of the

describe the "outward appearance" of these beings

and

events occurring with them. But that is obviously a pre-phe­

nomenological "business" which cannot be phenomenologically relevant
at all . The description gets stuck in beings. It is ontic. But we are, after all,
seeking being. We formally defined "phenomenon" in the phenomeno­
logical sense as that which shows itself as being and the structure of being.
Thus, to describe the "world" phenomenologically means to show
and determine the being of beings objectively present in the world con­
ceptually and categorially. Beings within the world are things, natural
things and "valuable" things. Their thingliness becomes a problem. And
since the thingliness of the latter is based upon natural thingliness, the
being of natural things, nature as such, is the primary theme. The char­
acter of being of natural things, of substances, which is the basis of
everything, is substantiality. What cons titutes its ontological meaning?
N ow we have given our investigation an unequivocal direction.
But are we asking ontologically about the "world"? The problem­
atic characterized is undoub tably ontological. But even if it succeeds in

59

60

Being

and

Time

1.111

the pures t explication of the being of nature, in comparison with the
fundamental s tatements made by the mathematical natural sciences
about this being, this ontology never gets at the phenomenon of the
"world. " Nature is itself a being which is encountered within the world
and is discoverable on various paths and stages.
Should we accordingly keep to the beings with which Da-sein ini­
tially and for the most part dwells, to "valuable" things? Do not these
things "really" show the world in which we live? Perhaps they do in fact

64

show something like "world" more penetratingly. But these things are,
after all , also beings "within" the world.

Neither the ontic description of innerworldly beings nor the ontological
interpretation of the being of these beings gets as such at the phenomenon of
"world. " In both kinds of access to "objective being, " "world" is already
"presupposed" in various ways .
Can "world" ultimately not be addressed as a determination of the
beings mentioned at all? But, after all, we do say that these beings are
innerworldly. Is "world" indeed a character of being of Da-sein? And
then does every Da-sein "initially " have its own world? Doesn't "world"
thus become something "subjective"? Then how is a "common" world still
possible "in" which we, after all, are? If we pose the question of "world,"
which world is meant? Neither this nor that world, but rather the worldli­
ness of world in general. How can we encounter this phenomenon?
"Worldliness" is an ontological concept and designates the struc­
ture of a constitutive factor of being-in-the-world. But we have come to
know b eing-in-the-world as an exis tential determination of Da-sein.
Accordingly, worldliness is itself an existential. When we inquire onto­
logically about the "world," we by no means abandon the thematic field
of the analytic of Da-sein. "World" is ontologically not a determination
of those beings which Da-sein essentially is

not,

but rather a characteristic

of Da-sein itself. This does not preclude the fact that the path of the
investigation of the phenomenon of "world" must be taken by way of
innerworldly beings and their being. The task of a phenomenological
"description" of the world is so far from obvious that its adequate deter­
mination already requires essential ontological clarification.
The multiplicity of meanings of the word "world" is striking now
that we have discussed it and made frequent application of it. Unraveling
this multiplicity can point toward the phenomena intended in their var­
ious meanings and their connection.

1.

World is used

as

an ontic concept and signifies the totality of beings

which can be objectively present within the world.

2.

World functions

as

an ontological term and signifies the being of

those beings named in 1. Indeed, "world" can name the region which

I.m

Being and

Time

61

embraces a multiplicity of beings. For example, when we speak of
the "world" of the mathematician, we mean the region of all possible
mathematical objects .

3.

Again, world can be understood i n an ontic sense, but n o t as beings
essentially unlike Da-sein that can be encountered within the world;
but, rather, as that

"in which"

a factical Da-sein "lives. " Here world has

a pre-ontological, existentiell meaning. There are various possibili­
ties here: world can mean the "public" world of the we or one's "own"
and nearest (in the home) surrounding world.

4. Finally, world designates the ontological and existential concept of
worldliness . Worldliness itself can be modified into the respective
structural totality of particular "worlds, " and contains the a priori of
worldliness in general. We shall reserve the expression world as a
tenn for the meaning established in

3.

If we use it at times in the

first meaning, we shall put it in quotation marks.
Thus, tenninologically "worldly" means a kind of being of Da-sein,
never a kind of being of something objectively present "in" the world.
We shall call the latter something belonging* to the world, or inner­
worldly.
One look at traditional ontology shows us that one

skips over the

phenomenon of worldliness when one fails to see the constitution of Da­
sein of being-in-the-world. Instead, one tries to interpret the world in
tenns of the being of the being which is objectively present within the
world but has not, however, even been initially discovered-in terms of
nature.t Ontologically and categorially understood, nature is a boundary
case of the being of possible innerworldly beings. Da-sein can discover
beings as nature only in a definite mode of its being-in-the-world. This
kind of knowledge has the character of a certain "de-worlding" of the
world. As the categorial content of structures of being of a definite
being encountered in the world, "nature" can never render

worldliness

intelligible. ! But even the phenomenon "nature," for instance in the
sense of the Romantic concept of nature, is ontologically comprehensi­
ble only in tenns of the concept of world; that is, in terms of an analytic
of Da-sein.
With regard to the problem of an ontological analysis of the world­
liness of the world, traditional ontology is at a dead-end-if it sees the
problem at all. On the other hand, an interpretation of the worldliness
of Da-sein and its possibilities and ways of becoming worldly, must show

why
66

I. JJJ

Being and Time

Da-sein skips over the phenomenon of worldliness ontically and

onto logically in its way of knowing the world. But at the same time this
fact of skipping over the phenomenon of worldliness indicates that spe­
cial measures are necessary in order to gain the correct phenomenal
point of departure for access to that phenomenon, a point of depar­
ture which does not permit any skipping over.
The methodological directive for this has already been given.
Being-in-the-world and thus the world as well must be the subj ect of
our analytic in the horizon of average everydayness as the

nearest kind of

being of Da-sein. We shall pursue everyday being-in-the-world. With it as
a phenomenal support, something like world must come into view.
The nearest world of everyday Da-sein is the

surrounding world.

Our investigation will follow the path from this existential character of
average being-in-the-world to the idea of worldliness as such. We shall
seek the worldliness of the surrounding world (environmentality) by
way of an ontological interpretation of those beings initially encoun­
tered within the

surroundings.

The expression surrounding world con­

tains a reference to spatiality in its component "around. " The quality of
"around" which is constitutive for the surrounding world does not, how­
ever, have a primarily " spatial" meaning. Rather, the spatial character
which uncontestably belongs to a surrounding world can be clarified
only on the basis of the structure of worldliness. Here the spatiality of
Da-sein mentioned in section

12

becomes phenomenally visible. But

ontology has tried precisely to interpret the being of the "world" as

extensa

res

on the basis of spatiality. The most extreme tendency toward

such an ontology of the "world," oriented in opposition to the

tans which is neither ontically nor

res cogi­

ontologically identical with Da-sein, is

to be found in Descartes. The analysis of worldliness attempted here
becomes clearer if we show how it differs from such an ontological ten­
dency. It has three stages: (A) An analysis of environmentality and world­
liness in general. (B) An illustrative contrast between our analysis of
worldliness and Descartes' ontology of the "world. "

(C) The around­

ness of the surrounding world and the "spatiality" of Da-sein.

taking care of things. However, as we showed, the nearest kind of asso­
ciation is not mere perceptual cognition, but, rather, a handling, using,
and taking care of things which has its own kind of "knowledge. " Our
phenomenological question is initially concerned with the being of those
b eings encountered when taking care of something. A methodical
remark is necessary to secure the kind of seeing required here.
In the disclosure and explication of being, beings are always our
preliminary and accompanying theme. The real theme is being. What
shows itself in taking care of things in the surrounding world consti­
tutes the pre-thematic being in the domain of our analysis. This being is
not the object of a theoretical "world"-cognition; it is what is used, pro­
duced, and so on. As a being thus encountered, it comes pre-themati­
cally into view for a "knowing" which, as a phenomenological knowing,
primarily looks toward being and on the basis of this thematization of
being thematizes actual beings as well. Thus, this phenomenological
interpretation is not a cognition of existent qualities of b eings; but,
rather, a determination of the structure of their being. But as an inves­
tigation of being it independently and explicitly brings about the under­
standing of being which always already belongs to Da-sein and is "alive"
in every association with beings . Phenomenologically pre-thematic
beings, what is used and produced, become accessible when we put our­
selves in the place of taking care of things in the world. Strictly speaking,
to talk of putting ourselves in the place of taking care is misleading.
We do not first need to put ourselves in the place of this way of being in
associating with and taking care of things . Everyday D a-sein always
already

is in

this way; for example, in opening the door, I use the door­

knob. Gaining phenomenological access to the beings thus encountered
consists rather in rej ec ting the interpretational tendencies crowding
and accompanying us which cover over the phenomenon of " taking
care" of things in general, and thus even more so beings
encountered of their own accord

in taking care. These

as

they are

insidious mistakes

become clear when we ask: Which beings are to be our preliminary
theme and established as a pre-phenomenal basis?
We answer: things . But perhaps we have already missed the pre­
phenomenal basis we are looking for with this self-evident answer. For
an unexpressed anticipatory ontological characterization is contained in
addressing beings as " things" (res).

An analysis which starts with such

beings and goes on to inquire about being comes up with thingliness
and reality. Ontological explication thus finds, as it proceeds, charac­
teristics of being such as substantiality, materiality, extendedness, side-by­
sideness. . . . But the beings encountered and taken care of are also
pre-ontologically hidden at first in this being. When one designates

things as the beings that are "initially given" one goes astray ontologi-

cally, although one means something else ontically. What one really
means remains indefinite. Or else one characterizes these " things" as
"valuable ." What does value mean ontologically? How is this "having"
value and being involved with value to be understood categorially? Apart
from the obscurity of this structure of having value, is the phenomenal
character of being of what is encountered and taken care of in associa­
tion thus attained?
The Greeks had an appropriate term for "things": pragmata, that is,
that with which one has to do in taking care of things in association

(praxis).

But the specifically "pragmatic" character of the

pragmata

is

j u s t what was left in obscurity and "initially" determined as "mere
things . " * We shall call the beings encountered in taking care

things.

useful

In association we find things for writing, things for sewing, things

for working, driving, measuring. We must elucidate the kind of being of
useful things. This can be done following the guideline of the previous
definition of what makes useful thing a useful thing: usable material.
Strictly speaking, there "is" no such thing as

a useful

thing. There

always belongs to the being of a useful thing a totality of useful things in
which this useful thing can be what it is. A useful thing is essentially
"something in order to . . . ". The different kinds of "in order to" such as
serviceability, helpfulness, usability, handiness, constitute a totality of
useful things. The structure of "in order to" contains a

reference of some­

thing to something. Only in the following analyses can the phenomenon
indicated by this word be made visible in its ontological genesis. At this
time, our task is to bring a multiplicity of references phenomenally into
view. In accordance with their character of being usable material, useful
things always are

in terms of their belonging

to other useful things: writ­

ing materials, pen, ink, paper, desk blotter, table, lamp, furniture, win­
dows, doors, room. These "things" never show themselves initially by
themselves, in order then to fill out a room as a sum of real things.
What we encounter as nearest to us, although we do not grasp it the­
matically, is the room, not as what is "between the four walls" in a geo­
metrical, spatial sense, but rather as material for living. On the basis of
the latter we find "accommodations, " and in accommodations the actual

69

"individual" useful thing. A totality of useful things is always already
discovered

before the

individual useful thing.

Association geared to useful things which show themselves gen­
uinely only in this association, that is, hammering with the hammer,
neither grasps these beings thematically as occurring things nor does it

even know of using or the structure of useful things as such. Hamm ering

does not just have a knowledge of the useful character of the hammer;
rather, it has appropriated this useful thing in the most adequate way
possible . When we take care of things, we are subordinate to the in­
order-to constitutive for the actual useful thing in our association with it.
The less we just stare at the thing calle d hammer, the more actively we
use it, the more original our relation to it becomes and the more undis­
guisedly it is encountered as what it is, as a useful thing. The act of
hammering itself discovers the specific "handiness" of the h amm e r. We
shall call the useful thing's kind of being in which it reveals itself by
itself handiness . It is only because useful things have

this "being-in-them­

selves, " and do not merely occur, that they are handy in the broadest
sense and are at our disposal. No matter how keenly we just

look at

the

" outward appearance" of things constituted in one way or another, we
cannot discover handiness. When we just look at things " theoretically,"
we lack an understanding of handiness. But association which makes
use of things is not blind, it has its own way of seeing which guides our
operations and gives them their specific thingly quality. Our associa­
tion with useful things is subordinate to the manifold of references of
the "in-order-to. " The kind of seeing of this accommodation to things is
called

circumspection.

"Practical" behavior is not "atheoretical" in the sense of a lack of
seeing, and the difference between it and theoretical behavior lies not
only in the fact that on the one hand we observe and on the other we

act,

and that action must apply theoretical cognition if it is not to remain
blind. Rather, observation is a kind of taking care just as primordially as
action has

its own

kind of seeing. Theoretical behavior is just looking,

noncircumspectly. Because it is noncircumspect, looking is not without
rules; its canon takes shape in

method.

Handiness is not grasped theoretically at all, nor is it itself initially
a theme for circumspection. What is peculiar to what is initially at hand
is that it withdraws, so to speak, in its character of handiness in order to
be really handy. What everyday association is initially busy with is not
tools themselves, but the work. What is to be produced in each case is
what is primarily taken care of and is thus also what is at hand. The
work bears the totality of references in which useful things are encountered.

As the whatfor of the hammer, plane, and needle, the work to be

produced has in its tum the kind of being of a useful thing. The shoe to be
produced is for wearing (footgear), the clock is made for telling time.
The work which we primarily encounter when we deal with things and
take care of them-what we are at work with-always already lets us
encounter the what-for of

its

usability in the usability which essentially

belongs to it. The work that has been ordered exists in its tum only on the

70

66

l.m

Being and Time

basis o f its use and the referential context o f beings discovered i n that use.
But the work to be produced is not just useful for . . . ; production
itself is always a using

of something for something.

A reference to "mate­

rials" is contained in the work at the same time. The work is depen­
dent upon leather, thread, nails, and similar things. Leather in its tum is
produced from hides . These hides are taken from animals which were
bred and raised by others. We also find animals in the world which
were not bred and raised and even when they have been raised these
beings produce themselves in a certain sense. Thus beings are accessible
in the surrounding world which in themselves do not need to be pro­
duced and are always already at hand. Hammer, tongs, nails in them­
selves refer to-they consist of-steel, iron, metal, stone, wood. "Nature"
is also discovered in the use of useful things, "nature" in the light of
products of nature.
But nature must not be unders tood here as what is merely obj ec­
tively present, nor as the power of nature. The forest is a forest of timber,
the mountain a quarry of rock, the river is water power, the wind is
wind "in the sail s . " As the "surrounding world" is discovered, "nature"
thus discovered is encountered along with it. We can abstract from
nature's kind of being as handiness; we can discover and define it in its
pure obj ective presence. But in this kind of discovery of nature, nature
as what " stirs and strives , " what overcomes us, entrances us as land­
scape, remains hidden. The botanist's plants are not the flowers of the
hedgerow, the river's "source" ascertained by the geographer is not the
"source in the ground."
The work produced refers not only to the what-for of its usability
and the whereof of which it consists . The simple conditions of craft con-

to his figure; he "is" there as the work emerges. This constitutive refer­
ence is by no means lacking when wares are produced by the dozen; it is
only undefmed, pointing to the random and the average. Thus not only
beings which are at hand are encountered in the work but also beings
with the kind of being of Da-sein for whom what is produced becomes
handy in its taking care. Here the world is encountered in which wearers
and users live, a world which is at the same time our world. The work
taken care of in each case is not only at hand in the domestic world of the
workshop, but rather in the public

surrounding world of nature is

world. Along with the

public world, the

discovered and accessible to everyone. In tak­

ing care of things, nature is discovered as having some definite direc­
tion on paths, streets, bridges, and buildings. A covered railroad plat­
form takes bad weather into account, public lighting systems take
darkness into account, the specific change of the presence and absence of
daylight, the "position of the sun." Clocks take into account a specific con-

Being and Time

1.111

67

stellation in the world system. When we look at the clock, we tacitly use
the " position of the sun" according to which the official astronomical
regulation of time is carried out. The surrounding world of nature is
also at hand in the usage of clock equipment which is at first inconspic­
uously at hand.

Our absorption in taking care of things in the work world

nearest to us has the function of discovering; depending upon the way we
are absorbed, innerworldly beings that are brought along together with
their constitutive references are discoverable in varying degrees of explic­
itness and with a varying attentive penetration.
The kind of being of these beings is "handiness"

(Zuhandenheit).

But it must not be understood as a mere characteristic of interpreta­
tion, * as if such " aspects" were discursively forced upon "beings" which
we initially encounter, as if an initially obj ectively present world-stuff
were "subjectively colored" in this way. Such an interpretation overlooks
the fact that in that case beings would have to be understood before­
hand and discovered as purely objectively present, and would thus have
priority and take the lead in the order of discovering and appropriating
association with the "world." But this already goes against the ontological
meaning of the cognition which we showed to be a founded mode of
being-in-the-world. To expose what is merely objectively present, cogni­
tion must first penetrate beyond things at hand being taken care of. Hand­
iness is the ontological categorial definition of beings as they are "in themselves.

"

But "there are" handy things, after all, only on the basis of what is objec­
tively present. Admitting this thesis, does it then follow that handiness is
ontologically founded in obj ective presence?
But if, in our continuing ontological interpretation, handiness
proves to be the kind of being of beings first discovered within the
world, if its primordiality can ever be demonstrated over and against
pure objective presence, does what we have explained up to now con­
tribute in the least to an ontological understanding of the phenomenon
of world? We have, after all, always "presupposed" world in our inter­
pretation of these innerworldly beings. Joining these beings together
does not result as a sum in something like "world." Is there then any
path at all leading from the being of these beings to showing the phe­
nomenon of world?1

discovered and show themselves in their being because "there is" world.
But how "is there" world? If Da-sein is ontically constituted by being-in­
the-world and if an understanding of the being of its self belongs just as
essentially to it, even if that understanding is quite indeterminate, does
it not then have an understanding of world, a pre-ontological under­
standing which lacks and can dispense with explicit ontological insights?
Does not something like world show itself to being-in-the-world taking
care of the beings encountered within the world, that is, their inner­
worldliness? Does not this phenomenon come to a pre-phenomenolog­
ical view; is it not always in view without requiring a thematically onto­
logical interpretation? In the scope of its heedful absorption in useful
things at hand, does not Da-sein have a possibility of being in which,
together with the innerworldly beings taken care of, their worldliness
becomes apparent to it in a ·certain way?
If such possibilities of being of Da-sein can be shown in its heedful
associations, a path is opened to pursue the phenomenon thus illumi­
nated and to attempt, so to speak, to "place" it and interrogate the struc­
tures evident in it.

73

Modes of taking care belong to the everydayness of being-in-theworld, modes which let the beings taken care of be encountered in such a
way that the worldly quality of innerworldly beings appears. Beings near­
est at hand can be met up with in taking care of things as unusable, as
improperly adapted for their specific use. Tools tum out to be damaged,
their material unsuitable. In any case,

a

weful thing

of some sort is at

hand here. But we discover the unusability not by looking and ascertaining
properties, but rather by paying attention to the associations in which we
use it. When we discover its unusability, the thing becomes conspicuous.

Conspicuousness presents

the thing at hand in a certain unhandiness. But

this implies that what is unusable just lies there, it shows itself as a thing of
use which has this or that appearance and which is always also objectively
present with this or that outward appearance in its handiness. Pure objec­
tive presence makes itself known in the useful thing only to withdraw
again into the handiness of what is taken care of, that is, of what is being
put back into repair. This objective presence of what is unusable still does
not lack all handiness whatsoever; the useful thing thw objectively present
is still not a thing which just occurs somewhere. The damage to the useful
thing is still not a mere change in the thing, a change of qualities simply
occurring in something objectively present.
But heedful association does not just come up against unusable
things

within what is already at hand.

It also finds things which are miss­

ing, which are not only not "handy," but not "at hand" at all. When we
come upon something unhandy, our missing it in this way again dis­
covers what is at hand in a certain kind of mere objective presence.

69

Being and Time

1.111

When we notice its unhandiness, what is at hand enters the mode of

obtrusiveness. The more urgently we need what is

missing and the more

truly it is encountered in its unhandiness, all the more obtrusive does
what is at hand become, such that it seems to lose the character of hand­
iness. It reveals i tself as something merely obj ectively present, which
cannot be budged without the missing element. As a deficient mode of
taking care of things, the helpless way in which we stand before it dis­
covers the mere objective presence of what is at hand.
In associating with the world taken care of, what is unhandy can be
encountered not only in the sense of something unusable or completely
missing, but as something unhandy which is

not

missing at all and

not

unusable, but "gets in the way" of taking care of things. That to which
taking care of things cannot tum, for which it has "no time, " is some­
thing

u

nhandy

in the way of not belonging there, of not being com­

plete . Unhandy things are disturbing and make evident the

obstinacy

of

what is initially to be taken care of before anything else. With this obstinacy the objective presence of what is at hand makes itself known in a
new way as the being of what is still present and calls for completion.
The modes of conspicuousness, obtrusiveness, and obstinacy have
the function of bringing to the fore the character of objective presence
in what is at hand. What is at hand is not thereby

observed and stared at

simply as something objectively present. The character of objective pres­
ence making itself known is still bound to the handiness of useful things.
These s till do not disguise themselves as mere things. Useful things
become " things" in the sense of what one would like to throw away.
But in this tendency to throw things away, what is at hand is still shown
as being at hand in its unyielding objective presence.
But what does this reference to the modified way of encountering
what is at hand, a way in which its objective presence is revealed, mean
for the clarification of the

phenomenon of worltP.

In the analysis of this

modification, too, we are still involved with the being of innerworldly
beings. We have not yet come any closer to the phenomenon of world.
We have not yet grasped that phenomenon, but we now have the possi­
bility of catching sight of it.
In its conspicuousness, obtrusiveness, and obstinacy, what is at
hand loses its character of handiness in a certain sense. But this handi­
ness is itself understood, although not thematically, in associating with
what is at hand. It does not just disappear, but bids farewell, so to speak,
in the conspicuousness of what is unusable. Handiness shows itself once
again, and precisely in doing so the worldly character of what is at hand
also shows itself, too.
The structure of being of what is at hand as useful things is deter­
mined by references. The peculiar and self-evident "in itself' of the

74

70

Being and Time

1.111

nearest " things" i s encountered when w e take care o f things, using them
but not paying specific attention to them, while bumping into things that
are unusable. Something is unusable . This means that the constitutive
reference of the in-order-to to a what-for has been disturbed. The ref­
erences themselves are not observed, rather they are " there" in our
heedful adjustment to them. But in a

disturbance of reference

in being

-

unusable for . . . -the reference becomes explicit. It does not yet become
explicit as an ontological structure, but ontically for our circumspec­
tion which gets annoyed by the damaged tool. This circumspect noticing

75

of the reference to the particular what-for makes the what-for visible
and with it the context of the work, the whole "workshop" as that in
which taking care of things has always already been dwelling. The con­
text of useful things appears not as a totality never seen before, but as a
totality that has continually been seen beforehand in our circumspec­
tion . But with this totality world makes itself known.
Similarly, when something at hand is missing whose everyday pres­
ence was so much a matter of course that we never even paid attention
to it, this constitutes a

breach

in the context of references discovered in

our circumspection. Circumspection comes up with emptiness and now
sees for the firs t time what the missing thing was at hand for and at
hand

with.

Again, the surrounding world makes its elf known. What

appears in this way is not itself one thing at hand among others and cer­
tainly not something

objectively present which lies

at the basis of the useful

thing at hand. It is " there" before anyone has observed or ascertained it.
It is itself inaccessible to circumspection insofar as circumspection con­
centrates on beings, but it is always already disclosed for that circum­
spection. "To disclose" and "disclosedness" are used as technical terms
in what follows and mean " to unlock"-" to be open." Thus "to disclose"
never means anything like " obtaining something indirectly by infer­
ence. "
That the world does n o t "consist" of what is a t hand can be seen
from the fact (among others) that when the world appears in the modes
of taking care which we have just interpreted, what is at hand becomes
deprived of its worldliness so that it appears as something merely objec­
tively present. In order for useful things at hand to be encountered in
their character of "being-in-itself' in our everyday taking care of the
"surrounding world," the references and referential contexts in which
circumspection is " absorbed" must remain nonthematic for that cir­
cumspection and all the more so for a noncircumspect, " thematic"
abstract comprehension.

When the world does not make itself known,

that is

the condition for the possibility of what is at hand not emerging from its
inconspicuousness. And this is the constitution of the phenomenal struc­
ture of the being-in-itself of these beings .

Being and Time

1.111

71

Privative expressions such as inconspicuousness, unobtrusiveness,
and nonobstinacy tell of a positive phenomenal character of the being of
what is initially at hand. These negative prefixes express the character of
keeping to itself of what is at hand. That is what we have in mind with
being-in-itself which, however, we "initially" typically ascribe to things
obj ectively present, as that which can be thematically ascertained. When
we are primarily and exclusively oriented toward that which is objec­
tively present, the "in itself" cannot be ontologically explained at all.
However, we must demand an interpretation if the talk about "in-itself"
is to have any ontological importance. Mostly one appeals ontically and
emphatically to this in-itself of being, and with phenomenal justification. But this

logical

ontic

appeal does not already fulfill the claim of the

onto­

s tatement presumably given in such an appeal. The foregoing

analysis already makes it clear that the being-in-itself of innerworldly
beings is ontologically comprehensible only on the basis of the phe­
nomenon of world.
If, however, world can appear in a certain way, it must be dis­
closed in general. World is always already predisclosed for circumspect
heedfulness together with the accessibility of innerworldly beings at
hand. Thus, it is something "in which" Da-sein as a being always already
was,

that to which it can always only come back whenever it explicitly

moves toward something in some way.
According to our foregoing interpretation, being-in-the-world sig­
nifies the unthematic, circumspect absorption in the references consti­
tutive for the handiness of the totality of useful things . Taking care of
things always already occurs on the basis of a familiarity with the world.
In this familiarity Da-sein can lose itself in what i t encounters within
the world and be numbed by it. With what is Da-sein familiar? Why can
the worldly character of innerworldly beings appear? How is the refer­
ential totality in which circumspection "moves" to be understood more
precisely? When this totality is broken,2 the objective presence of beings
is thrust to the fore.
In order to answer these questions which aim at working out the
phenomenon

and problem

of worldliness, a concrete analysis of the struc­

tures is necessary in whose context our questions are being asked.

1 7. Reference and Signs
In our preliminary interpretation of the structure of being of things at
hand ("useful things"), the phenomenon of reference became visible, but
in such a sketchy fashion that we at the same time emphasized the neces­
sity of uncovering the phenomenon merely indicated with regard to its
ontological origin . Moreover, it became clear that reference and the

76

72

I.m

Being and Time

referential totality were in some sense constitutive of worldliness itself.
Until now we saw the world appear only in and for particular ways of tak­
ing care of what is at hand in the surrounding world, together

77

with

its

handiness. Thus the further we penetrate into the understanding of the
being of innerworldly beings, the more broad and certain the phenom­
enal basis for the freeing the phenomenon of world becomes.
We shall again take our point of departure with the being of what
is at hand with the intention of grasping the phenomenon of

reference

more precisely. For this purpose we shall attempt an ontological analysis
of the kind of useful thing in terms of which "references" can be found
in a manifold sense. Such a "useful thing" can be found in

signs.

This

word names many things. It names not only different kinds of signs, but
being-a-sign-for something can itself be formalized to a universal kind

relation so

of

that the sign structure itself yields an ontological guideline for

" characterizing" any being whatsoever.
But signs are themselves initially useful things whose specific char­
acter as useful things copsists in

indicating.

Such signs are signposts,

boundary-stones, the mariner's storm-cone, signals, flags, signs of mourn­
ing, and the like. Indicating can be defined as a "kind" of referring.
Taken in an extremely formal sense, to refer means to

relate.

But relation

does not function as the genus for "species" of reference which are dif­
ferentiated as sign, symbol, expression, and signification. Relation is a
formal definition which can be directly read off by way of "formaliza­
tion" from every kind of context, whatever its subj ect matter or way of
being.'
Every reference is a relation, but not every relation is a reference.
Every "indicating" is a reference, but not every reference is an indicating.
This means that every "indicating" is a relation, but not every relation is
an indicating. Thus the formal, universal character of relation becomes
apparent. If we investigate such phenomena as reference, sign, or even
signification, nothing is to be gained* by characterizing them as rela­
tions. Finally, we must even show that "relation" itself has its ontological
origin in reference

because of its formal,

universal character.

If this analysis is limited to an interpretation of the sign as dis-

78

tinct from the phenomenon of reference, even within this limitation, the
full multiplicity of possible signs cannot be adequately investigated.
Among signs there are symptoms, signs pointing backward

as

well as for­

ward, marks, hallmarks whose way of indicating is different regardless of
what it is that serves as a sign. We should differentiate these signs from
the following: traces, residues, monuments, documents, certificates,

*

This is fundamental for demonstrating the possibility for the claim of logistics.

1.111

Being and Time

73

symb ols, expressions, appearances, significations. These phenomena
can easily be formalized on the basis of their formal relational character.
We are especially inclined today to subject all beings to an "interpreta­
ti on" following the guideline of such a "relation," an interpretation
which is always "correct" because it basically says nothing, no more than
the facile scheme of form and content.
As an example of a sign, we choose one which we shall see again in
a later analysis, though in a different regard. Motor cars are equipped
with an adjustable red arrow whose position indicates which direction
the car will take, for example, at an intersection. The position of the
arrow is regulated by the driver of the car. This sign is a useful thing
which is at hand not only for the heedfulness (steering) of the driver.
Those who are not in the car-and they especially-make use of this use­
ful thing in that they yield accordingly or remain standing. This sign is
handy within the world in the totality of the context of useful things
belonging to vehicles and traffic regulations. As a useful thing, this
pointer is constituted by reference. It has the character of in-order-to, its
specific serviceability, it is there in order to indicate. The indicating of
this sign can be taken as a kind of "referring." But here we must note
that this "referring" as indicating is not the ontological structure of the
sign as a useful thing.
As indicating, "referring" is rather grounded in the structure of
being of useful things, in serviceability for. The latter does not auto­
matically make something a sign. The useful thing "hammer" is also
characterized by serviceability, but it does not thus become a sign. The
"referral" of indicating is the ontic concretion of the what-for of ser­
viceability, and determines a useful thing for that what-for. The referral
"serviceability for," on the other hand, is an ontological, categorical
determination of the useful thing as useful thing. The fact that the what­
for of serviceability gets its concretion in indicating is accidental to the
constitution of the useful thing as such. The distinction between referral
as serviceability and referral as indicating became roughly apparent in
the example of the sign. The two coincide so litde that their unity first
makes possible a particular kind of useful thing. But just as surely as indieating is fundamentally different from referral as the constitution of a
useful thing, it is just as incontestable that signs have a peculiar and
even distinctive relation to the kind of being of the totality of useful
things present in the surrounding world and their worldly character.
Useful things which indicate have an eminent use in heedful association.
However, it cannot suffice ontologically simply to ascertain this fact.
The ground and meaning of this pre-eminence must be clarified.
What does the indicating of a sign mean? We can only answer this
by defining the appropriate way of associating with things that indicate.

79

74

l.m

Being and Time

I n doing this w e must also make their handiness genuinely comprehen­
sible . What is the appropriate way of dealing with signs? Taking our
orientation toward the above example (the arrow), we must say that the
corresponding behavior (being) toward the sign encountered is "yield­
ing" or "remaining still " with reference to the approaching car which has
the arrow. As a way of taking a direction, yielding belongs essentially to
the being-in-the-world of Da-sein. Da-sein is always somehow directed
and underway. Standing and remaining are only boundary instances of
this directed being "underway." Signs address themselves to a specifically
"spatial" being-in-the-world. A sign is

not

really "comprehended" when

we stare at it and ascertain that it is an indicating thing that occurs .
Even if we follow the direction which the arrow indicates and look at
something which is objectively present in the region thus indicated,
even then the sign is not really encountered. The sign applies to the
circumspection of heedful association in such a way that the circum­
spection following its direction brings the actual aroundness of the sur­
rounding world into an explicit "overview" in that compliance. Circum­
spect overseeing does not

comprehend what is at hand.

Instead, it acquires

an orientation within the surrounding world. Another possibility of
experiencing useful things lies in encountering the arrow as a useful
thing belonging to the car. Here the arrow's specific character of being
a useful thing need not be discovered. What and how it is to indicate can
remain completely undetermined, and yet what is encountered is not a
mere thing. As opposed to the nearest finding of a multiply undeter­
mined manifold of useful things, the experience of a thing requires its
own

definiteness.
Signs such as we have described let what is at hand be encoun­

tered, more precisely, let their context become accessible in such a way

80

that heedful association gets and secures an orientation. Signs are not
things which stand in an indicating relationship to another thing but are

useful things which explicitly bring a totality of useful things to circumspection
so that the worldly character of what is at hand makes itself known at the same
time. In symptoms and preliminary indications "what is coming" "shows
itself, " but not in the sense of something merely occurring which is
added to what is already objectively present. "What is coming" is some­
thing which we expect or " didn't expect" insofar as we were busy with
other things. What has happened and occurred becomes accessible to
our circumspection through signs after it has already happened. Signs
indicate what is actually "going o n . " Signs always indicate primarily
"wherein" we live, what our heedfulness is concerned with, what the
relevance is.
The peculiar character of useful things as signs becomes especially
clear in " establishing a sign." This happens in and through a circumspect

I.m

Being and Time

75

an ticipation which needs the possibility at hand of letting the actual sur­
rounding world make itself known for circumspection through some­
thing at hand at any time. But the character of not emerging and keep­
ing to itself which we described belongs to the being of innerworldly
beings at hand nearest to us. Thus circumspect association in the sur­
rounding world needs a useful thing at hand which in its character of
b eing a useful thing takes over the "work" of
become

conspicuous.

letting

things at hand

Accordingly, production of such useful things

(signs ) must take their conspicuousness into consideration. But even as
conspicuous things, they are not taken as objectively present arbitrarily,
but are "set up" in a definite way with a view toward easy accessibility.
But establishing signs does not necessarily have to come about in
such a way that a useful thing at hand which was not yet present at all is
produced. Signs also originate when something already at hand is
as

a sign.

taken

In this mode establishing a sign reveals a still more primordial

meaning. Indicating not only creates the circumspectly oriented avail­
ability of a totality of useful things and the surrounding world in general,
establishing a sign can even discover something for the first time. What
is taken as a sign firs t becomes accessible through its handiness . For
example, when the south wind is "accepted" by the farmer as a sign of
rain, this "acceptance" or the "value attached" to this being is not a kind
of bonus attached to something already objectively present, that is, the
movement of the wind and a certain geographical direction. As this
mere occurrence which is meteorologically accessible, the south wind is

never initially

objectively present which sometimes takes on the func-

tion of omen. Rather, the farmer's circumspection first discovers the
south wind i n its being by taking th e lay of th e land into account.
But, one will protest,

what

is taken as a sign must, after all, firs t

have become accessible in itself and grasped

before establishing the sign.

To be sure, i t must already be there in some way or another. The ques­
tion simply remains

how

beings are discovered in this preliminary

encounter, whether as something merely occurring and not rather as an
uncomprehended kind of useful thing, a thing at hand which one did
not know "what to do with" up to now, which accordingly veiled itself to
circumspection. Here again, one must also not interpret the character of use·
ful things at hand which have not been discovered by circumspection as mere
thingliness presented for the comprehension of something merely objectively
present.
The handy presence of signs in everyday associations and the con­
spicuousness which belongs to signs and can be produced with varying
intentions and in different ways not only document the inconspicuous­
ness constitutive for what is at hand nearest to us, the sign itself takes its
conspicuousness from the inconspicuousness of the totality of useful

81

76

&ing and Time

things at hand in everydayness as a "matter of course, " for example,
the well-known "string on one's finger" as a reminder. What it is sup­
posed to indicate is always something to be taken care of within the
purview of everydayness. This sign can indicate many things of the most
diverse sort. The narrowness of intelligibility and use corresponds to
the breadth of what can be indicated in such signs. Not only is it mostly
at hand as a sign only for the person who "establishes" it, it can become
inaccessible to him so that a second sign is necessary for the possible cir­
cumspect applicability of the first one. The knot which cannot be used as
a sign does not thus lose its sign character, but rather acquires the dis­
turbing obtrusiveness of something near at hand.
One could be tempted to illustrate the distinctive role of signs in
everyday heedfulness for the understanding of the world itself by citing
the extensive use of "signs," such as fetishism and magic, in primitive Da­
sein. Certainly the establishment of signs that underlies such use of
signs does not come about with theoretical intent and by way of theo­
retical speculation. The use of signs remains completely within an
"immediate" b eing-in-the-world. But when one looks more closely, it
becomes clear that the interpretation of fetishism and magic under the

82

guideline of the idea of signs is not sufficient at all to comprehend the
kind of "handiness" of beings encountered in the world of primitives.
With regard to the phenomenon of signs, we might give the following
interpretation that for primitive people the sign coincides with what it
indicates. The sign itself can represent what it indicates not only in the
sense of replacing it, but in such a way that the sign itself always

is what

is indicated. This remarkable coincidence of the sign with what is indi­
cated does not, however, mean that the sign-thing has already under­
gone a certain "objectification," has been experienced as a pure thing
and been transposed together with what is signified to the same region
of being of objective presence. The "coincidence" is not an identification
of hitherto isolated things, but rather the sign has not yet become free
from that for which it is a sign. This kind of use of signs is still com­
pletely absorbed in the being of what is indicated so that a sign as such
cannot be detached at all . The coincidence is not based on a first objec­
tification, but rather upon the complete lack of such an objectification.
But this means that signs are not at all discovered as useful things, that
ultimately what is "at hand" in the world does not have the kind of
being of useful things at all . Perhaps this ontological guideline (handi­
ness and useful things), too, can provide nothing for an interpretation of
the primitive world, and certainly for an ontology of thingliness. But if
an understanding of being is constitutive for primitive Da-sein and the
primitive world in general, it is all the more urgent to develop the "for­
mal" idea of worldliness; namely, of a phenomenon which can be mod-

ified in such a way that all ontological statements which assert that in a
given phenomenal context something is

not yet

or

no longer

such and

such may acquire a positive phenomenal meaning in terms of what it is

not.
The foregoing interpretation of signs should simply offer phe­
nomenal support for our characterization of reference . The relation
between sign and reference is threefold:

( I ) As

a possible concretion of

the what-for of serviceability, the indicating is based upon the structure
of useful things in general, upon the in-order-to (reference).

(2) As

the

character of useful things at hand, the indicating of signs belongs to a
totality of useful things, to a referential context.

(3)

Signs are notjust at

hand along with other useful things but rather in their handiness the sur­
rounding world becomes explicitly accessible to circumspection. Signs are
something ontically at hand which as this definite useful thingfunctioru at the
same time as something which indicates the ontological structure of handiness,
referential totality, and worldliness. The distinctive characteristic of these
things at hand within the surrounding world circumspectly taken care of
is rooted here. Thus reference cann o t itself be comprehended as a sign
if it is ontologically to be the foundation for signs. Reference is not the
ontic specification of something at hand since it, after all , constitutes
handiness itself. In what sense is reference the ontological "presupposition" of what is at hand, and as this ontological foundation, to what
extent is it at the same time constitutive of worldliness in general?

18. Relevance and Significance: The Worldliness of the World
Things at hand are encountered within the world. The being of these
beings, handiness, is thus ontologically related to the world and to world­
liness. The world is always already "there" in all things at hand. World is
already discovered* beforehand together with everything encountered,
although not thematically. However, it can also appear in certain ways of
associating with the surrounding world. World is that in terms of which
things a,t hand are at hand for us. How can world let things at hand be
encountered? Our analysis showed that what is encountered within the
world is freed in its being for heedful circumspection, for taking matters
into account. What does this prior freeing mean and how is it to be
understood as the ontological distinction of the world? What problems
does the question of the worldliness of the world confront?
The constitution of useful things as things at hand has been
described as reference. How can world free beings of this kind with
regard to their being, why are these beings encountered first? We men-

* cleared

tioned serviceability for, impairment, usability, and so forth, as spe­
cific kinds of reference. The what-for of serviceability and the wherefore
of usability prefigure the possible c oncretion of reference. The "indi­
cating" of signs, the "hammering" of the hammer, however, are not
qualities of beings . They are not qualities at all if this term is supposed
to designate the ontological structure of a possible determination of
things . In any case, things at hand are suited and unsuited for things,
and their " qualities" are, so to speak, still bound up with that suitability
or unsuitability, just as obj ective presence, as a possible kind of being of
things at hand, is still bound up with handiness. But as the constitution
of useful things, serviceability (reference) is also not the suitability of
beings, but the condition of the possibility of being for their being able
to be determined by suitability. But then what does reference mean?
The fact that the being of things at hand has the s tructure of refer-

84

ence means that they have in themselves the character of being referred.
Beings are discovered with regard to the fact that they are referred, as

together
with something else . The character of being of things at hand is rele­
vance. To be relevant means to let something be together with some­
those beings which they are, to something. They are relevant

thing else . The relation of "together . . . with . . . " is to be indicated by
the term reference .
Relevance is the being of innerworldly beings , for which they are
always already initially fre ed. Beings are in each case relevant. Being is
the

ontological

determination of the being of these beings, not an on tic

statement about beings . What the relevance is about is the what-for of
serviceability, the wherefore of usability. The what-for of serviceability
can in turn be relevant. For example, the thing at hand which we call a
hammer has to do with hammering, the hammering has to do with fas­
tening something, fas tening something has to do with protection against
bad weather. This protection "is" for the sake of providing shelter for
Da-sein, that is, for the sake of a possibility of its being.

Which

relevance

things at hand have is prefigured in terms of the total relevance. The
total relevance which, for example, constitutes the things at hand in a
workshop in their handiness is " earlier" than any single useful thing, as
is the farmstead with all its utensils and neighboring lands. The total rel­
evance itself, however, ultimately leads back to a what-for which

no longer

has relevance, which itself is not a being of the kind of being of things at
hand within a world, but is a being whose being is defined as being-in­
the-world, to whose constitution of being worldliness itself belongs. This
primary what-for is not just another for-that as a possible factor in rele­
vance. The primary "what-for" is a for-the-sake-of-which. But the for­
the-sake-of-which always concerns the being of Da-sein which is essentially
concerned

about

this being itself in its being. For the moment we shall

1.111

Being and Time

79

not pursue any further the connection indicated which leads from the
s tructure of relevance to the being of Da-s ein i ts elf as the real and
unique for-the-sake-of-which. "Letting some thing be relevant" firs t of
all requires a clarification which goes far enough to bring the phe­
nomenon of worldliness to

the

kind of definiteness needed in order to

be able to ask questions about it in general.
Ontically, to let something be relevant means to let things at hand

be*

in such and such a way in factical taking care of things, to let them be

as they are and in

order that they be such.

We grasp the ontic meaning of

this "letting be" in a fundamentally ontological way. Thus we interpret the
meaning of the previous freeing of innerworldly beings initially at hand.
Previously letting "be" does not mean first to bring something to i ts
being and produce it, but rather to discover something that is already a
"being" in its handiness and thus let it be encountered as the being of this
being. t Tills

"a priori" letting something be

relevant is the condition of the

possibility that things at hand be encountered so that Da-sein in its ontic
association with the beings thus encountered can let them be relevant in
an ontic sense. On the other hand, letting something be relevant, under­
stood in an ontological sense, concerns the freeing of every thing at hand
as a thing at hand, whether it is relevant in the ontic sense or whether it
is such a being which is precisely

not relevant ontically-which is initially

and for the most part what is taken care of, which we do not let "be" as
the discovered being it is, but work over it, improve it, destroy it.
To have always already let something be freed for relevance is an

priori perfectt

a

characterizing the kind of being of Da-sein itself. Under­

stood ontologically, letting something be relevant is the previous freeing
of beings for their innerworldly handiness. The with-what of relevance is
freed in terms of the together-with-what of relevance. It is encountered
by heedfulness as this thing at hand. When a being shows itself in general

to heedfulness, that is, when a being is discovered in its being, it is
always already a thing at hand in the surrounding world and precisely
not "initially" merely objectively present "world-stuff."

As the being of things at hand, relevance itself is always discov­
ered only on the basis of a relevant totality previously discovered, that is,
in the things at hand encountered; what we called the worldly character
of things at hand thus lies prediscovered.This totality of relevance pre­
viously discovered contains an ontological relation to the world. Let­
ting beings be relevant and thus freeing them for a totality of relevance
must have already somehow disclosed that for which it is freeing.That
for which things at hand in the surrounding world are freed (in such a
way that the things at hand first become accessible

as

innerworldly

beings) cannot itself be understood as a being of the kind of being thus
discovered. It is essentially not discoverable if we restrict

discoveredness as

the term for a possibility of being of all beings unlike Da-sein.
But now what does that mean, to say that for which innerworldly
beings are initially freed must previously be disclosed? An understanding
of being belongs to the being of Da-sein.Understanding has its being in

86

an act of understanding.If the kind of being of being-in-the-world essen­
tially belongs to Da-sein, then the understanding of being-in-the-world
belongs to the essential content of its understanding of being.The pre­
vious disclosure of that for which the freeing of things encountered in
the world ensues is none other than the understanding of world to
which Da-sein

as

a being is always already related.

Previous letting something be relevant to ... with ... is grounded
in an understanding of something like letting things be relevant, and
such things as the in-which and with-which of relevance.These things
and what underlies them, such as the what-for to which relevance is
related, the for-the-sake-of-which from which every what-for is ultimately
derived, all of these must be previously disclosed in a certain intelligi­
bility. And what is that in which Da-sein understands itself pre-ontolog­
ically as being-in-the-world? In understanding a context of relations, Da­
sein has been referred to an in-order-to in terms of an explicitly or
inexplicitly grasped potentiality-of-its-being for the sake of which it is,
which can be authentic or inauthentic.This prefigures a what-for as the
possible letting something be relevant which structurally allows for rel­
evance

to something else. Da-sein is always in each case already referred

in terms of a for-the-sake-of-which to the with-what of relevance. This
means that, insofar as it is, it always already lets beings be encountered
as things at hand. That

within

which Da-sein understands itself before­

hand in the mode of self-reference is that

for which it lets beings be
that for which one lets beings be encountered in
the kind of being of relevance, the wherein of self-referential understanding is the
encountered beforehand.As

1.111

phenomenon of world.

81

And the structure of that to which Da-sein is

referred is what constitutes the

worldliness of

the world.

Da-sein is primordially familiar with that within which it under­
stands itself in this way. This familiarity with the world does not neces­
sarily require a theoretical transparency of the relations constituting
the world as world. But it is probable that the possibility of an explicit
ontological and existential interpretation of these relations is grounded
in the familiarity with the world constitutive for Da-sein. This familiarity,
in its tum, helps to constitute Da-sein's understanding of being. This pos­
sibility can be explicitly appropriated when Da-sein has set as its task a
primordial interpretation of its being and the possibilities of that being
or, for that matter, of the meaning of being in general.
But as yet our analyses have only first laid bare the horizon within
which something akin to world and worldliness is to be sought. For our
further reflection, we must first make clear how the context of the self­
referral of Da-sein is to be understood ontologically.

Understanding,

which will be analyzed with proper penetration

in what follows (see section

31),

holds the indicated relations in a pre­

liminary disclosure. In its familiar being-in-relevance, understanding
holds itself

before

that disclosure as that within which its reference

moves. Understanding can itself be referred in and by these relations.
We shall call the relational character of these referential relations

nifying.

sig­

In its familiarity with these relations, Da-sein "signifies" to

itself. It primordially gives itself to understand its being and poten­
tiality-of-being with regard to its being-in-the-world. The for-the-sake-of­
which signifies an in-order-to, the in-order-to signifies a what-for, the
what-for signifies a what-in of letting something be relevant, and the
latter a what-with of relevance. These relations are interlocked among
themselves as a primordial totality. They are what they are as this sig­
nifying in which Da-sein gives itself to understand its being-in-the­
world beforehand. We shall call this relational totality of signification

significance.

It is what constitutes the structure of the world, of that in

which Da-sein* as such always already is.

In its familiarity with signifi­
cance Da-sein is the antic condition of the possibility of the disclosure of beings
encountered in the mode of being of relevance (handiness) in a world that can
thus make themselves known in their in-itself. As such, Da-sein always
means that a context of things at hand is already essentially discov­
ered with its being. In that it

is,

Da-sein has always already referred

itselft to an encounter with a "world." This

dependency of being referred

belongs essentially to its being.

87

82

88

1.111

But the significance itself with which Da-sein is always already
familiar contains the ontological condition of the possibility that Da­
sein, understanding and interpreting, can disclose something akin to
"significations" which in tum found the possible being of words and
language.*
As the existential constitution of Da-sein, its being-in-the-world,
disclosed significance is the ontic condition of the possibility for dis­
covering a totality of relevance.
If we thus define the being of what is at hand (relevance) and even
worldliness itself as a referential context, are we not volatizing the "sub­
stantial being" of innerworldly beings into a system of relations, and,
since relations are always "something thought," are we not dissolving the
being of innerworldly beings into "pure thought"?
Within the present field of investigation the repeatedly designated
differences of the structures and dimensions of the ontological prob­
lematic are to be fundamentally distinguished:
1. The being of the innerworldly beings initially encountered (handi­

ness);
2. The being ofbeings (objective presence) that is found and determined
by discovering them in their own right in going through beings ini­
tially encountered;
3. The being of the ontic condition of the possibility of discovering
innerworldly beings in general, the worldliness t of the world.
This third kind of being is an existential determination of being-in-the­
world, that is, of Da-sein. The other two concepts of being are categories
and concern beings unlike Da-sein. The referential context that consti­
tutes worldliness as significance can be formally understood in the sense
of a system of relations. But we must realize that such formalizations
level down the phenomena to the extent that the true phenomenal con­
tent gets lost, especially in the case of such "simple" relations as are
contained in significance. These "relations" and "relata" of the in-order­
to, for-the-sake-of, the with-what of relevance resist any kind of mathe­
matical functionalization in accordance with their phenomenal content.
Nor are they something thought, something first posited in "thinking, "
but rather relations in which heedful circumspection as such already
dwells. As constitutive of worldliness, this "system of relations" does
not volatize the being of innerworldly beings at all . On the contrary,

these beings are discoverable in their "substantial" "in itself' only on the
basis of the worldliness of the world. And only when innerworldly beings
can be encountered at all does the possibility exist of making what is
merely objectively present accessible in the field of these beings. On
the basis of their merely objective presence these beings can be deter­
mined mathematically in "functional concepts" with regard to their
"properties." Functional concepts of this kind are ontologically possible
only in relation to beings whose being has the character of pure sub­
stantiality. Functional concepts are always possible only as formalized
substantial concepts .
In order to delineate the specific ontological problematic of world­
liness still more clearly, the interpretation of worldliness is to be clarified
in terms of an extreme counter-example before preceding with our anal­
ysis .
B. CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR ANALYSIS OF WORLDLINESS
AND DESCARTES' IN TERPRETATION OF THE WORLD

Our investigation can secure the concept of worldliness and the struc­
tures contained in this phenomenon only step by step. Since the inter­
pretation of the world initially starts with an innerworldly being and
then never gains sight of the phenomenon of world again, we shall
attempt to clarify this point of departure ontologically in what is perhaps
its most extreme development. We shall not only give a short presenta­
tion of the fundamental features of Descartes' ontology of the "world,"
but also ask about its presuppositions and try to characterize those pre­
suppositions in the light of what has been clarified up to now. This dis­
cussion should tell us on what fundamentally undiscussed ontological
"foundations" the interpretations of the world after Descartes, and espe­
cially those preceding him, are based.
Descartes sees the fundamental ontological determination of the
world as extensio. Since extension is a component of spatiality, for
Descartes in fact identical with it, and since spatiality is in some sense
constitutive of the world, our discussion of the Cartesian ontology of the
"world" at the same time offers a negative support for the positive expli­
cation of the spatiality of the surrounding world and of Da-sein itself.
With regard to Descartes' ontology we shall discuss three things:
I. The determination of the "world" as res extensa ( 1 9).
2. The foundations of this ontological determination (20).
3. The hermeneutical discussion of the Cartesian ontology of the
"world" (21).

The following reflections can be grounded in more detail only by the phe­
nomenological de-structuring of the cogito sum (cf. part 2, division 2). *
19.

90

The Determination of the "World " as Res Extensa

Descartes distinguishes the ego cogito as res cogitans from the res corporea.
From then on this distinction ontologically defines the distinction of
"spirit" and "nature." Although this opposition between nature and
spirit is formulated ontically in many variations of content, the unclarity
of its ontological fundaments and even of the poles of this opposition
itself have their proximate roots in Descartes' distinction. In what kind of
understanding of being did he determine the being of these beings?
The term for the being of beings in themselves is substantia. This expression sometimes means the being of beings as substance, substantiality,
sometimes beings themselves, particular substances. This ambiguity of
substantia, already inherent in the ancient concept of ousia,t is not acci­
dental.
The ontological determination of the res corporea requires the expli­
cation of substance, that is, of the substantiality of these beings as par­
ticular substances. What constitutes the true being-in-itself of the res cor­
pore a? How is a substance as such, that is, i ts substantiality to be
understood? Et quidem ex quolibet attributo substantia cognoscitur; sed una
tamen est cuis que substantiae praecipua proprietas, quae ipsius naturam essen­
tiamque constituit, et ad quam aliae omnes referuntur.4 Substances are acces­
sible through their "attributes," and every substance has an eminent
property in terms of which the essence of the substantiality of a definite
substance can be determined. What is this property with regard to the
res corporea? Nempe extensio in longum, latum, et profundum, substantiae
coporeae naturam constituit. 5 Extension in terms of length, breadth, and
depth constitutes the real being of the corporeal substance that we call
"world." What gives the extensio this distinction? Nam omne aliud quod cor­
pori tribui potest, extensionem praesupponit. 6 Extension is the constitution of
being of the beings under discussion, a constitution which must already
"be" before o ther determinations of being in order for the latter to be
able to "be" what they are. Extension must primarily be "attributed" to
the corporeal thing. Accordingly, the proof for the extension and the
substantiality of the "world" characterized by that extension is accom­
plished by showing how all other properties of this substance, above all
divisio, figura, motus can only be conceived as modes of extensio and the
extensio, conversely, is intelligible sine figura vel motu.

And especially the on; to on: (1) being (beingness), (2) beings.

85

Thus a corporeal being can maintain its total extension and yet
change the distribution of the extension in many ways and in various
dimensions and still present itself as one and the same thing in manifold
shapes. Atque unum et idem corpus, retinendo suam eandem quantitatem,
pluribus diversis modis potest extendi: nunc scilicet magis secundum longi­
tudinem, minusque secundum latitudinem vel projunditatem, ac paulo post e
contra magis secundum latitudinem et minus secundum longitudinem. 7
Gestalt is a mode of extensio, and motion as well. For motus is comprehended only si de nullo nisi locali cogitemus, a c de vi a qua excitatur
non inquiramus.8 If motion is an existent property of the res corporea, it

91

must be understood in terms of the being of this being itself, in terms of

extensio, that is,

as mere change of location in order to be experienced in

its being. Something like "force" adds nothing to the determination of
the

being

(weight),

of this being. Properties such as

color,

durities

(hardness),

pondus

can be removed from matter, yet matter remains what it

is. These properties do not constitute its true being. Insofar as they are,

extensio. Descartes attempts to show this in

detail with regard to "hardness":

by touch. What does the sense of touch "tell" us about hardness? The
parts of the hard thing "resist" the motion of the hands, for instance in
wanting to push something away. But if the hard bodies, those that do
not give way, changed their location with the same speed as the hand
"approaching" the bodies, nothing would ever be touched. Hardness
would not be experienced and thus would never

be.

But it is in no way

comprehen!lible that bodies that give way with such velocity should thus
forfeit any of their corporeal being. If they were to retain this even
under a change of velocity which makes it impossible for anything like
"hardness" to be, then hardness does not belong to the being of these

omnes eiusmodi qualitates, quae in materia corporea sentiuntur, ex ea tolli

change in every kind of divisibility, gestalt, and motion, the capax mutationum, what persists throughout all these changes, remanet. In a corporeal being what is capable of such a remaining constant is its true being, in

duced in the broadest sense and to be sustained. The production of what
is objectively present and the lack of need for production constitute the
horizon within which "being" is understood. Every being other than God

"infinitely" different from that which belongs to the other; yet we still
consider what is created and the creator alike as

beings. We thus use being

in such a broad sense that its meaning encompasses an "infmite" distinc­
tion. Thus we can also call created beings substances with a certain justi­
fication. It is true that these beings need to be produced and sustained, rel­
ative to God, but within the region of created beings, of the "world" in the
sense of the

ens creatum, there are beings which are "in need of no other

being" relative to creaturely production and sustenance for instance,

res cogitans and res extensa.
that substance whose eminent proprietas is extensio is
thus definable in principle ontologically when the meaning of being
"common" to the three substances, the one infinite and the two finite
ones, is clarified. But nomen substantiae non convenit Deo et illis univoce, ut

Descartes touches upon a problem which occupied medieval ontology in
many ways, the question in what way the meaning of being signifies the
being under consideration. In statements such as "God is" and "the
world is" we predicate being. But this word "is" cannot signify the being

(suniinumiis, univoce)* when, after all, there
infinite distinction of being between the two beings. If the signifi­

uncreated or else the uncreated would be degraded to being a crea­
ture. But "being" does not simply function as the same name; rather, in
both cases "being" is understood. Scholasticism understands the positive
sense of the significance of "being" as an "analogous" meaning in con­
tradistinction to the univocal or merely homonymous one. Following
Aristotle in whom the problem is prefigured, as it is in the point of
departure of Greek ontology in general, various kinds of analogy were
established according to which the "schools" differ in their interpreta­
tion of the functional significance of being. With regard to the onto­
logical development of the problem, Descartes is far behind the scholas­
tics;15 he actually evades the question. Nulla eius (substantiae) nominis
signijicatio potest distincte intelligi, quae Deo et creaturis sit communis. 16 This
evasion means that Descartes leaves the meaning of being contained in
the idea of substantiality and the character of "universality" of this mean­
ing unexplained. Medieval ontology left the question of what being itself
means just as unquestioned as did ancient ontology. Thus it is not sur­
prising if a question such as that of the kinds of significations of being
gets nowhere as long as it is to be discussed on the foundation of an
unclarified meaning of being which the signification "expresses." The
meaning was unclarified because it was held to be "self-evident."*
Descartes not only completely evades the ontological question of
substantiality, he emphasizes explicitly that substance as such, that is, its
substantiality, is in and for itself inaccessible from the very beginning.

Verumtamen non potest substantia primum animadverti ex hoc solo, quod sit
res existens, quia hoc solum per se nos non afficit. 17 "Being" itself does not
"affect" us, therefore it cannot be perceived. "Being is not a real predi­
cate"t according to Kant who is only repeating Descartes' statement.
Thus the possibility of a pure problematic of being is renounced in
principle and a way out is sought for arriving at the definitions of sub­
stances designated above. Because "being" is in fact not accessible as a

being,

it is expressed by existing definite qualities of the beings in ques-

tion, by attributes. Not, however, by arbitrary qualities, but by those
that most purely satisfying the meaning of being and substantiality tacitly
presupposed.

Extensio is the primarily necessary "attribute" in the sub­
stantia finita as res corporea. Q!lin et Jacilius intelligimus substantiam extensam, vel substantiam cogitantem, quam substantiam solam, omisso eo quod

Thus the ontological foundations for the definition of "world" as

res exten.sa have become clear:

the idea of substantiality which is not only

unexplained in the meaning of its being, but also declared to be inex­
plicable, and is presented by way of a detour around the most distinctive
substantial attribute of the substance in question. In the definition of
substance in terms of a substantial being one also sees the reason why
the term substance is ambiguous. What is intended is substantiality and it
is understood in terms of an existent quality of substance. Because some­
thing ontic is made to underlie the ontological, the expression substantia
functions sometimes in an ontological, sometimes in an ontic meaning,
but mostly in a meaning which shifts about in a hazy mixture of the
two. But behind this slight difference of meaning lies hidden the failure
to master the fundamental problem of being.* Its development requires
"tracking down" the equivocations

in the right way.

Whoever tries this

sort of thing is not "occupied" with "mere verbal meanings," but must

venture forth to the most primordial problematic of the "things them­
selves" to get such "nuances" straightened out.
21.

Hermeneutical Discussion of the Cartesian Ontology of the "World"

The critical question now arises: Does this ontology of the "world" see
the phenomenon of world at all, and if not, does it at least define inner­
worldly beings to the extent that their worldly character can be made vis­
ible?

To both questions we must answer "No".

The being which Descartes is

trying to grasp ontologically and in principle with the

extensio is rather of

such a nature that can be initially discovered only through an inner­
worldly being initially at hand. But if this and even if the ontological
characteristic of

this particular innerworldly being (nature)-the idea of
existit and ad existendum con­

substantiality as well as the meaning of

tained in its definition-leads to obscurity, the possibility nonetheless
still exists that through an ontology grounded in the radical separation
of God, ego, "world," the ontological problem of the world is in some
sense raised and further advanced. But even if this possibility does not
exist, we must show explicitly that Descartes not only goes amiss onto­
logically in his definition of the world, but that his interpretation and its
foundations led him to pass

over

the phenomenon of world as well as the

being of innerworldly beings initially at hand.
In our exposition of the problem of worldliness (section 14) we
referred to the importance of gaining proper access to this phe­
nomenon. Thus in our critical discussion of the Cartesian point of
departure we must ask which kind of being of Da-sein we should fix

upon as the appropriate kind of access to

extensio

89

that being with whose being as

Descartes equates the being of the "world." The sole, genuine

access to this being is knowing,

intellectio,

in the sense of the kind of

knowledge we get in mathematics and physics. Mathematical knowledge
is regarded as the one way of apprehending beings which can always be
certain of the secure possession of the being of the beings which it
apprehends. Whatever has the kind of being adequate to the being
accessible in mathematical knowledge is in the true sense. Tiris being is

what always is what it is. Thus what can be shown to have the character of
constantly remaining, as remanens capax mutationem, constitutes the true
being of beings which can be experienced in the world. What enduringly
remains truly is. Tiris is the sort of thing that mathematics knows. What
mathematics makes accessible in beings constitutes their being. Thus the
being of the "world" is, so to speak, dictated to it in terms of a definite
idea of being which is embedded in the concept of substantiality and in
terms of an idea of knowledge which cognizes beings

in this way.

Descartes does not allow the kind of being of innerworldly beings to present itself, but rather prescribes to the world, so to speak, its "true"
being on the basis of an idea of being (being

=

constant objective pres­

ence) the source of which has not been revealed and the justification of
which has not been demonstrated. Thus it is not primarily his depen­
dence upon a science, mathematics, which just happens to be especially
esteemed, that detennines his ontology of the world, rather his ontology
is determined by a basic ontological orientation toward being as constant
objective presence, which mathematical knowledge is exceptionally well
suited to grasp.* In this way Descartes explicitly switches over philo­
sophically from the development of traditional ontology to modem
mathematical physics and its transcendental foundations.
Descartes does not need to raise the problem of the appropriate
access to innerworldly beings. Under the unbroken dominance of tra­
ditional ontology, the way to get a grasp of what truly is has been
decided in advance. That way lies in
the broadest sense, of which

noein, "intuition" (Ansckauung) in
dianoein, "thinking," is just a derivative

form. It is in terms of this basic ontological orientation that Descartes
gives his "critique" of the possible intuitive-perceptive access to beings, of

sensatio (aistkesis)

as opposed to

intellectio.

Descartes knows very well that beings do not initially show them­
selves in their true being. What is given "initially" is this waxen thing
which is colored, flavored, hard, cold, and resonant in a definite way.
But this is not important ontologically, nor, in general, is anything which

is given through the senses. Satis erit, si advertamw sensuum perceptiones
non referri, nisi ad istam corporis humani cum mente coniunctionem, et nobis
quidem ordinarie exhibere, quid ad illam externa corpora prodesse possint aut
nocere. 19 The senses do not enable us to know any being in its being;
they merely make known the usefulness and harmfulness of "external"
innerworldly things for human beings encumbered with bodies . Nos
non docent, qualia (corpora) in seipsw existant;20 they tell us nothing at all
about beings in their being. Quod agentes, percipiemw naturam materiae,
sive corporis in universum spectat� non consistere in eo quod sit res dura vel
ponderosa vel colorata, vel alio aliquo modo senses afficiens: sed tantum in eo,
quod sit res extensa in longum, latum et profundum. 21
If we subject Descartes' interpretation of the experience of hard­
ness and resistance to a critical analysis, it will be plain how unable he is
to let what shows itself in sensation present itself in its own kind of
being, let alone determine its character. (Cf. section 1 9. )
Hardness is understood a s resistance. But neither hardness nor
resistance is understood in a phenomenal sense, as something experi­
enced in itself and determinable in such experience. For Descartes,
resistance amounts to no more than not yielding place, that is, not
undergoing any change of location. A thing's resistance means that it
stays in a definite place, relative to another thing changing its place, or
else that it changes its own location with a velocity that permits the
thing to " catch up" with it. But when the experience of hardness is inter­
preted in this way, the kind of being that belongs to sensory percep­
tion is obliterated, and with it the possibility of grasping the being of
those beings encountered in such perception. Descartes translates the
kind of being of the perception of something into the only kind of being
that he knows: the perception of something becomes a definite objective
presence of two objectively present res extensa next to each other; the
relation of their movements is itself a mode of extensio that primarily
characterizes the objective presence of the corporeal thing. It is true
that the possible "fulfillment" of the act of touching requires a distinctive
"nearness " of what is touchable. But that does not mean that touching
and the hardness made known in touching consist, ontologically under­
stood, in different velocities of two corporeal things. Hardness and resis­
tance do not show themselves at all unless there is a being which has the
kind of being of Da-sein, or at least of a living being.
Thus Descartes' discussion of the possible kinds of access to inner­
worldly beings is dominated by an idea of being which is patterned after
a particular region of these beings themselves.
The idea of being as constant objective presence not only motivates an extreme definition of the being of innerworldly beings and
their identification with the world as such. At the same time, it blocks the

1.111

Being and Time

91

possibility of bringing to view attitudes of Da-s ein in a way which is
ontologically appropriate. But thus the road is completely blocked to see­
ing the founded character of all sensuous and intellective apprehen­
sion, and to understanding them as a possibility of being-in-the-world.
But Descartes understands the being of "Da-sein," to whose basic con­
stitution being-in-the-world belongs, in the same way as the being of res
extensa, as substance.
But with these criticisms have we not foisted upon Descartes a
task altogether beyond his horizon, and then "demonstrated" that he
failed to solve it? How could Descartes identify a definite innerworldly
being and its being with the world if he does not know the phenomenon
of world at all and thus something akin to innerworldliness?
In the realm of controversy over principles, one must not only
attach oneself to theses which can be grasped doxographically, rather
one must take the objective tendency of the problematic as an orienta­
tion, even if it does not go beyond a rather common version of that
problematic. The fact that Descartes not only wanted to raise the question
of "self and world" with his doctrine of res cogitans and res extensa, but
claimed to give a radical solution, becomes clear in his Meditations ( cf.
especially I and IV) . The preceding discussion should have demon­
strated that the basic ontological orientation toward the tradition, devoid
of any positive criticism, made it impossible for him to clear the way for
a primordial ontological problematic of Da-sein, and necessarily dis­
torted his view of the phenomenon of the world and forced the ontology
of the "world" into the ontology of a particular innerworldly being.
One might obj ect, however, that even if the problem of the world
and also the being of beings encountered in the surrounding world
indeed remain obscured, Descartes nonetheless laid the foundation for
the ontological characteristic of that innerworldly being which in its
being is the basis for every other being, material nature.* The other
strata of innerworldly reality are based upon it, the fundamental stratum.
The definite properties which do show themselves as qualities, but which
are "basically" quantitative modifications of the modes of extensio itself,
initially have their basis in the extended thing as such. Specific qualities
such as beautiful, not beautiful, fitting, unfitting, usable, unusable then
find a footing in these qualities which are themselves further reducible.
Those specific qualities must be understood in a primary orientation to
thingliness as nonquantifiable value predicates through which the thing,
initially merely material, gets stamped as something good. But with this
stratification we come, after all, to the being that we characterized onto* Critique of Husserl's development of ontologies! just

as

logically as the useful thing at hand. Thus the Cartesian analysis of the
"world" first makes possible a secure erection of the structure of what is
initially at hand. It only needs to round out the natural thing to a com­
plete thing of use, a task easily accomplished.
But apart from the specific problem of the world, is the being of
what we initially encounter in the world ontologically attainable in this
way? When we speak of material thingliness, do we not tacitly posit a
kind of being-the constant objective presence of a thing-which is so far
from being rounded out ontologically by subsequently outfitting beings
with value predicates that these value characters themselves rather
remain mere ontic qualities of a being which has the kind of being of a
thing? The addition of value predicates is not in the least able to tell us
anything new about the being of goods, but rather only again presupposes
for them the kind of being of pure objective presence. Values are objectively
present determinations of a thing. In the end, values have their ontolog­
ical origin solely in the previous point of departure of the reality of the
thing as the fundamental stratum. But pre-phenomenological experi­
ence already shows something about the being supposed to be a thing
which is not fully intelligible through thingliness. Thus thinglike being
needs a supplement. What, then, does the being of values or their "valid­
ity," which Lotze understood as a mode of "affirmation," mean onto­
logically? What does this "inherence" of values in things mean ontolog­
ically? As long as these matters remain obscure, the reconstruction of a
thing of use in terms of a thing of nature is an ontologically questionable
undertaking, not to speak of the fundamental distortion of the prob­
lematic. And does not this reconstruction of the initially "stripped"
thing of use always need the previous, positive view of the phenomenon
whose totality is to be reestablished in the reconstruction? But if its ownmost
constitution of being of the phenomenon is not adequately explicated,
are we not building the reconstruction without a plan? In that this recon­
struction and "rounding out" of the traditional ontology of the "world"
results in our reaching the same being from which the above analysis of
the handiness of useful things and totality of relevance took its point of
departure, it seems as if the being of that being were indeed clarified or
had at least become a problem. Just as Descartes cannot grasp the being
of substance with extensio as proprietas, the flight to "valuable" qualities
cannot even catch sight of being as handiness, let alone make it onto­
logically thematic.
Descartes narrowed down the question of the world to that of the
thingliness of nature as that innerworldly being which is initially acces­
sible. He strengthened the opinion that the supposedly strictest antic
knowledge of a being is also the possible access to the primary being of
the being discovered in such knowledge. But we must at the same time

1.111

Being and Time

93

realize that the "roundings-out" of an ontology of things are funda­
mentally on the same dogmatic basis as that of Descartes.
We have already intimated (section 14) that passing over the world
and those beings initially encountered is not a matter of chance, not an
oversight which we could simply make up for, but rather is grounded in
the essential kind of being of Da-sein itself. When our analytic of Da-sein
has made the most important basic structures of Da-sein transparent in
the scope of this problematic, when we have assigned to being in general
the horizon of its possible intelligibility,* thus first making handiness and
objective presence ontologically and primordially intelligible, too, only
then can the critique of the Cartesian ontology of the world, basically
still customary today, claim its philosophical justification.
To do this, we must show several things (cf. Part I, Division 3):
1. Why was the phenomenon of world passed over at the beginning of

the ontological tradition decisive for us, explicitly in Parmenides;
where does the constant recurrence of this passing over come from?
2. Why do innerworldly beings take the place of the phenomenon thus
passed over as the ontological theme?
3. Why are these beings initially found in "nature"?
4. Why does the rounding out of such an ontology of the world, expe­
rienced as necessary, take place with the help of the phenomenon of
value?
In the answers to these questions a positive understanding of the

problematic of the world will be reached, for the first time the source of
our failure to recognize it will be demonstrated and the justification for
rejecting the traditional ontology of the world will have been demon­
strated.
The world and Da-sein and innerworldly beings are the ontologically constitutive states nearest to us; but we have no guarantee that we
achieve the basis for encountering them phenomenally by the seemingly obvious procedure of starting with the things of the world, still less
by taking our orientation from what is supposedly the most rigorous
knowledge of beings. Our remarks about Descartes should have brought
us this insight.
But if we recall that spatiality also manifestly constitutes inner­
worldly beings, it is, after all, possible to "salvage" the Cartesian analysis
of the "world" in the long run. With his radical exposition of extensio as
the praesuppositum for every quality of the res corporea, Descartes pre* Sic! Of course, "intelligibility" is based on understanding as project, project as

pared the way for the understanding of an a priori whose content Kant
then made precise with greater penetration. Within certain limits, the
analysis of extensio remains independent of his neglecting to provide an
explicit interpretation of the being of extended beings. Taking extensio as
the basic determination of the "world" has its phenomenal justification,
although in recourse to it neither the spatiality of the world nor the
spatiality initially discovered of beings encountered in the surrounding
world, nor even the spatiality of Da-sein itself, can be conceived onto­
logically.
C. THE AROUNDNESS OF THE SURROUNDING WORLD
AND THE SPATIALITY OF DA-SEIN

102

In connection with our first preliminary sketch of being-in (cf. section
1 2), Da-sein had to be contrasted with a way of being in space which we
call insideness . This means that a being which is itself extended is sur­
rounded by the extended boundaries of something extended. The being
which is inside and what surrounds it are both objectively present in
space. Our rejection of such an insideness of Da-sein in a spatial con­
tainer should not, however, basically exclude all spatiality of Da-sein,
but only keep the way dear for seeing the kind of spatiality which is
constitutive for Da-sein. This must now be set forth. But since inner­
worldly beings are also in space, their spatiality has an ontological con­
nection with the world.* Thus we must determine in what sense space is
constitutive for the world which in tum was characterized as a struc­
tural factor of being-in-the-world. We must especially show how the
aroundness of the surrounding world, the specific spatiality of the beings
encountered in the surrounding world is grounded in the worldliness of
the world, and not the other way around, that is, we cannot say that
the world in its tum is objectively present in space. Our study of the spa­
tiality of Da-sein and the spatial definiteness of the world takes its point
of departure from an analysis of the innerworldly things at hand in
space. We shall consider three stages: ( 1) The spatiality of innerworldly
things at hand (section 22). (2) The spatiality of being-in-the-world (sec­
tion 23). (3) The spatiality of Da-sein and space (section 24).
22. The Spatiality of Innerworldly Things at Hand

mine, it cannot be surprising that in our foregoing ontological charac*

terization of the being of what is

95

within the world we already had to have

that being in view as something in space, too. This spatiality of things at
hand has not yet been grasped phenomenally in an explicit way and its
interconnection with the structures of being of what is at hand has not
yet been demonstrated. That is now the task.
To what extent have we already bumped up against this spatiality
in our characterization of what is at hand? We spoke of what is

tially

ini­

at hand. This means not only beings which we encounter first

before others, but means at the same time beings that are "near by. "
The things a t hand o f everyday association have the character o f near­

ness.

To be exact, this nearness of useful things is already hinted at in

the term which expresses their being, in "handiness." Beings "at hand"
have their various proximities which are not ascertained by measuring
distances. Their nearness is determined by the handling and use that
circumspectly "calculate. " The circumspection of taking care of things
at the same time establishes what is thus near with respect to the direc­
tion in which useful things are always accessible. The structured near­
ness of useful things means that they do not simply have a place in
space, objectively present somewhere, but as useful things are essen­
tially installed, put in their place, set up, and put in order. Useful things
have their

place,

or else they "lie around, " which is fundamentally dif­

ferent from merely occurring in a random spatial position. The actual
place is defined as the place of this useful thing for . . . in terms of a
totality of the interconnected places of the context of useful things at
hand in the surrounding world. Place and the multiplicity of places
must not be interpreted as the where of a random objective presence of
things. Place is always the definite "over there" and the "there" of a use­
ful thing

belonging there. Actual belonging

there corresponds to the use-

ful character of what is at hand, that is, to its relevant belonging to a
totality of useful things. But a whereto in general, i n which the positional totality is referred to a context of useful things, underlies the
positional belonging somewhere of a totality of useful things as the
condition of their possibility. We call this whereto of the possible
belonging somewhere of useful things, circumspectly held in view in
advance, and heedful association, the

region.

"In the region of" means not only "in the direction of," but also in
the orbit of s omething that lies in that direction. The kind of place
which is constituted by direction and remoteness-nearness is only a
mode of the latter-is already oriented toward a region and within that
region. Something akin to a region must already be discovered if there
is to be any possibility of referring and finding the places of a totality of
useful things available to circumspection. This regional orientation of
the multiplicity of places of what is at hand constitutes the aroundness,

103

96

I.m

Being and Time

the being around us of beings encountered initially in the surrounding
world. There is never a three-dimensional multiplicity of possible posi­
tions initially given which is then filled out with obj ectively present
things. This dimensionality of space is still veiled in the spatiality of
what is at hand. The "above" is what is "on the ceiling," the "below" is
what is "on the floor," the "behind" is what is "at the door." All these
wheres are discovered and circumspectly interpreted on the paths and
ways of everyday associations, they are not ascertained and catalogued by
the observational measurement of space.
Regions are not first formed by things objectively present together,
but are always already at hand in individual places. The places them­
selves are assigned to what is at hand in the circumspection of taking
care of things, or else we come across them. Thus things constantly at
hand, with which circumspect being-in-the-world reckons from the out­
set, have their place. The where of their handiness is taken account of in
taking care of things and is oriented toward other handy things. Thus
the sun whose light and warmth we make use of every day has its cir­
cumspectly discovered, eminent places in terms of the changing usabil­
ity of what it gives us: sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight. The places of
these things, which are constantly at hand in various ways and yet uni­
formly, become accentuated "indicators" of the regions contained in
them. These regions of the sky which do not yet need to have any geo­
graphical meaning at all, give beforehand the whereto for every partic­
ular development of regions which c an be occupied by places. The
104

house has its sunny side and its shady side. This provides the orientation
for dividing up the "rooms" and " arranging" them according to their
useful character. Churches and graves , for example, are laid out accord­
ing to the rising and setting of the sun-the regions of life and death
which determine Da-sein itself with regard to its ownm ost possibilities of
being in the world. In taking care of things Da-sein which is in its very
b eing concerned about that being, discovers beforehand the regions
which are each in a decisive relevance. The discovery of regions before­
hand is determined by the totality of relevance for which what is at
hand is set free as something encountered.
The handiness which belongs to each region beforehand has as the
being of what is at hand the

character of inconspicuous familiarity

in a

more primordial sense. The familiarity itself becomes visible in a con­
spicuous manner only when what is at hand is discovered circumspectly
in the deficient mode of taking care of things . When we do not find
something in

its place,

the region of that place often becomes explicitly

accessible as such for the first time. Space, which is discovered in cir­
cumspect being-in-the-world

as

the spatiality of a totality of useful things,

belongs to beings themselves as their place. Bare space is s till veiled.

I. III

Being and Time

97

Space is split up into places. * But this spatiality has its own unity by
virtue of the worldlike totality of relevance of what is spatially at hand.
The "surrounding world" does not arrange itself in a previously given
space, but rather its specific worldliness articulates in its significance
the relevant context of an actual totality of places cir cums pectly referred
to each other. The actual world discovers the spatiality of space belong­
ing to it. The fact that what is at hand can be encountered in its space of
the surrounding world is ontically possible only because Da-sein itself is
"spatial" with regard to its being-in-the-world.
23.

The Spatiality of Being-in-the- World

When we attribute spatiality to Da-sein, this "being in space" must evi­
dently be understood in tenns of the kind of being of this being. The
spatiality of Da-sein, which is essentially not objective presence, can
mean neither s omething like being found in a position in "world
space" nor being at hand in a place. Both of these are kinds of being
b elonging to beings encountered in the world. But Da-sein is "in" the
world in the sense of a familiar and heedful association with the beings
encountered within the world. Thus when spatiality is attributed to it
in some way, this is possible only on the basis of this being-in. But the
spatiality of being-in shows the character of de-distancing and

direction-

ality.
By de-distancing as a kind of being of Da-sein with regard to its
being-in-the-world, we do not understand anything like remoteness
(nearness) or even being at a distance. We use the expression de-dis­
tancing in an active and transitive sense. It means a constitution of being
of Da-sein of which de-distancing something, putting it away, is only a
definite, factical mode. De-distancing means making distance disap­
pear,t making the being at a distance of something disappear, bringing
it near. Da-sein is essentially de-distancing. As the being that it is, it lets
beings be encountered in nearness . De-distancing discovers remoteness.
Remoteness, like distance, is a categorial determination of beings unlike
Da-sein. De-distancing, on the other hand, must be kept in mind as an
existential. Only because beings in general are discovered by Da-sein in
their remoteness , do " distances" and intervals among innerworldly
beings become accessible in relation to other things. Two points are as
little remote from each other as two things in general because neither of
these beings can de-distance in accordance with its kind of being. They

merely have a measurable distance between them which is encountered
in de-distancing. *
Initially and for the mos t part, de-distancing is a circumspect
approaching, a bringing near as supplying, preparing, having at hand. But
particular kinds of the purely cognitive discovery of beings also have the
character of bringing near.

sein. t All kinds

An essential tendency toward nearness lies in Da·

of increasing speed which we are more or less compelled

to go along with today push for overcoming distance. With the "radio,"
for example, Da-sein is bringing about today de-distancing of the "world"
which is unforeseeable in its meaning for Da-sein, by way of expanding
and destroying the everyday surrounding world.
De-distancing does not necessarily imply an explicit estimation of
the farness of things at hand in relation to Da-sein. Above all, remote­
ness is never understood as measurable distance. If farness is estimated,
this is done relative to the de-distancing in which everyday Da-sein is
involved. In the calculative sense these estimations may be imprecise
and variable, but they have their

own

thoroughly intelligible

definiteness in

the everydayness of Da-sein. We say that to go over there is a good walk,
a stone's throw, as long it takes to smoke a pipe. These measures express

106

the fact that they not only do not intend to "measure," but that the esti­
mated remoteness belongs to a being which one approaches in a cir­
cumspect, heedful way. But even when we use more exact measures
and say "it takes half an hour to get to the house," this measure must be
understood as an estimation. "Half an hour" is not thirty minutes, but a
duration which does not have any "length" in the sense of a quantitative
stretch. Till s duration is always interpreted in terms of familiar, everyday
"activities." Even where "officially" calculated measurements are familiar,
remoteness is initially estimated circumspectly. Because what is de-dis­
tanced is at hand in such estimates, it retains its specifically innerworldly
character. This even implies that the paths we take in our associations to
remote beings are of different lengths every day. What is at hand in the
surrounding world is, after all, not obj ectively present for an eternal
spectator exempt from Da-sein, but is encountered in the circumspect,
heedful everydayness of Da-sein. On these paths Da-sein does not tra­
verse, like an objectively present corporeal thing, a stretch of space, it
does not "eat up kilometers"; nearing and de-distancing are always a
heedful being toward what is approached and de-distanced.

An "objec­

tively" long path can be shorter than an " objectively" much shorter path
which is perhaps an "onerous one" and strikes one as infinitely long.

When it "strikes " one thus, however, the actual world is first truly at hand.
The objective distances of objectively present things do not coincide
with the remoteness and nearness of what is at hand within the world.
The former may be exactly known, but this knowledge is blind. It does
not have the function of the circumspectly discovering approach to the
surrounding world. One uses such knowledge only in and for a heedful
being which does not measure stretches and which is related to the
world which "concerns" us.
When there is a prior orientation toward "nature" and the "objec­
tively" measured distances of things, one is inclined to consider such
interpretations and estimates of remoteness "subjective. " However, that
is a "subjectivity" which perhaps discovers what is most real about the
"reality" of the world, which has nothing to do with "subjective" arbi­
trariness and the subjectivistic "conceptions" of beings which are "in
themselves" otherwise. The circumspect de-distancing of everyday Da-sein
discovers the being-in-itself of the "true " world, of beings with which Da-sein as
existing is always already together.
The primary and even exclusive orientation toward remoteness
as measured distances, obscures the primordial spatiality of being-in.
What is supposedly "nearest" is by no means that which has the smallest
distance "from us." What is "near" lies in that which is in the circle of an
average reach, grasp, and look. Since Da-sein is essentially spatial in the
manner of de-distancing, its associations always take place in a "sur­
rounding world" which is remote from it in a certain leeway. Thus we
initially always overlook and fail to hear what is measurably "nearest" to
us. Seeing and hearing are senses of distance not because of their scope,
but because Da-sein, de-distancing, predominantly lives in them. For
someone who, for example, wears spectacles which are distantially so
near to him that they are "sitting on his nose," this useful thing is further
away in the surrounding world than the picture on the wall across the
room. This useful thing has so little nearness that it is often not even to
be found at all initially. Useful things for seeing, and those for hearing,
for example, the telephone receiver, have the inconspicuousness of what
is initially at hand which we characterized. That is also true, for example,
of the street, the useful thing for walking. When we walk, we feel it with
every step and it seems to be what is nearest and most real about what is
generally at hand, it slides itself, so to speak, along certain parts of our
body-the soles of one's feet. And yet it is further remote than the
acquaintance one meets while walking at the "remoteness" twenty steps
away "on the street." Circumspect heedfulness decides about the nearness and farness of what is initially at hand in the surrounding world.
Whatever this heedfulness dwells in from the beginning is what is nearest, and regulates our de-distancing.

1.111

When Da-sein in taking care brings something near, this does not
mean that it flxes upon something at a position in space which has the
least measurable distance from a point of its body. To be near means to
be in the range of what is initially at hand for circumspection. Bringing
near is not oriented toward the I-thing encumbered with a body, but
rather toward heedful being-in-the-world, that is, what that being-in-the­
world initially encounters. Neither is the spatiality of Da-sein determined
by citing the position where a corporeal thing is objectively present. It is
true that we also say of Da-sein that it occupies a place. But this "occu­
pying" is to be fundamentally differentiated from being at hand at a
place in terms of a region. Occupying a place must be understood as de­
distancing what is at hand in the surrounding world in a region previ­
ously discovered circumspectly beforehand. Da-sein understands its here
in terms of the over there of the surrounding world. The here does not
mean the where of something objectively present, but the where of de­
distancing being with . . . together with this de-distancing. In accor­
dance with its spatiality, Da-sein is initially never here, but over there.
From this over there it comes back to its here, and it does this only by
interpreting its heedful being toward something in terms of what is at
hand over there. This becomes quite clear from a phenomenal pecu­
liarity of being-in which has the structure of de-distancing.
As being-in-the-world, Da-sein essentially dwells in de-distancing.
This de-distancing, the farness from itself of what is at hand, is some­
thing that Da-sein can never cross over. It is true that Da-sein can take
the remoteness of something at hand to be distance if that remoteness is
determined in relation to a thing which is thought of as being objectively
present at a place which Da-sein has already occupied. Da-sein can sub­
sequently traverse the "between" of this distance, but only in such a
way that the distance itself becomes de-distanced. So little has Da-sein
crossed over its de-distancing that it rather has taken it along and con­
tinues to do so because it is essentially de-distancing, that is, it is spatial. Da­
sein cannot wander around in the current range of its de-distancings, it
can only change them. Da-sein is spatial by way of circumspectly dis­
covering space so that it is related to .beings thus spatially encountered
by constantly de-distancing.
As being-in which de-distances, Da-sein has at the same time the
character of directionality. Every bringing near has always taken a direc­
tion in a region beforehand from which what is de-distanced approaches
so that it can be discovered with regard to its place. Circumspect heed­
fulness is a directional de-distancing. In this heedfulness, that is, in the
being-in-the-world of Da-sein itself, the need for "signs" is already pre­
sent. As useful things, signs take over the giving of directions in a way
which is explicit and easily handled. They explicitly keep the circum-

1. 111

Being and Time

101

spectly used regions open, th e actual whereto o f belonging, going, bring­
ing, fetching. If Da-sein

is,

it always already has directing and de-dis­

tancing, its discovered region. As modes of being of being-in-the-world,
directing and de-distancing are guided beforehand by the

circumspection

of

heedfulness.
The firm directions of right and left originate out of this direc­
tionality. Da-sein continually takes these directions along together with
its de-distancing. The spatialization of Da-sein in its "corporeality," which
contains a problematic of i ts own not to be discussed here, is also
marked out in accordance with these directions. Thus things at hand and
in use for the body, such as gloves, for example, that must go along
with the hands' movement, must be oriented in terms of right and left.
Tools, however, which are held in the hand and moved with it, do not go
along with the specifically "handlike" movement of the hand Thus there
are no right- and left-handed hammers, even though they are held with
the hand as gloves are.
But we must observe the fact that the directionality that belongs to
de-distancing is grounded in being-in-the-world. Left and right are not
something " subjective" for which the subject has a feeling, but they are
directions of orientation in a world which is always already at hand. I
could never find my way around in a world "by the mere feeling of a dif­
ference between my two sides. "22 The subject with the "mere feeling" of
this difference is a construct posited without regard to the true consti­
tution of the subject, namely that whenever Da-sein has this "mere feel­
ing" it is always already in a world

and must be in order to be

able to ori­

ent itself at all. This becomes clear in the example with which Kant tries
to clarify the phenomenon of orientation.
Let us assume that I enter a familiar but dark room which has
been rearranged during my absence in such a way that everything which
was on the right-hand side is now on the left-hand side. If I am to get ori­
ented, the "mere feeling of the difference" between my two sides does
not help at all as long as I do not apprehend s ome particular object
"whose position," as Kant casually remarks, "I have in mind." But what
else does this mean except that I necessarily orient myself in and from
already being in a "familiar" * world. The context of useful things in a
world must already be given to Da-sein. The fact that I

am

always already

in a world is no less constitutive for the possibility of orientation than the
feeling for right and left. That this constitution of being of Da-sein is
obvious does not justify suppressing it in its ontologically constitutive
role. Kant does not suppress it either, any more than any other inter-

* From a familiar belongingness that I hold before myself and vary accordingly.

109

1 02

Being and Time

1.111

pretation of Da-sein. Continual use of this constitution does not, how­
ever, exempt us from giving an adequate ontological explication, but
rather requires it. The psychological interpretation that the ego has
s omething "in mind" fundamentally refers to the existential constitu-

1 10

tion of being-in-the-world. Because Kant did not see this structure, he
failed to understand the

full context of the constitution of a possible ori­

entation. Directedness toward the right or the left is grounded in the
essential directionality of Da-sein in general, which in turn is essentially
determined by being-in-the-world. However, Kant is not interes ted in a
thematic interpretation of orientation, either. He only wishes to show

all orientation needs a "subjective principle." But "subjective" means
a priori. The a priori of directionality in terms of right and left,
however, is grounded in the "subjective" a priori of being-in-the-world,

that

here

which has nothing to do with a determinate character restricted before­
hand to a worldless subject.
As constitutive characteristics of being-in, de-distancing and direc­
tionality determine the spatiality of Da-sein, for its being heedfully and
circumspectly in discovered innerworldly space. Our previous explica­
tion of the spatiality of innerworldly things at hand and the spatiality of
being-in-the-world firs t give the presuppositions for working out the
phenomenon of the spatiality of the world and for asking about the
ontological problem of space.
24.

The Spatiality of Da-sein and Space

As being-in-the-world, Da-sein has always already discovered a "world."
We characterized this discovering which is founded in the worldliness of
the world as the freeing of beings for a totality of relevance. Freeing
something and letting it be relevant occur by way of circumspect self­
reference which is grounded in a previous understanding of significa­
tion. We have now shown that circumspect being-in-the-world is spatial.
And only because Da-sein is spatial by way of de-distancing and direc­
tionality can things at hand in the surrounding world be encountered in
their spatiality. The freeing of a totality of relevance is equiprimordially
a letting something be relevant in a region which de-distances and gives
direction. It is a freeing of the spatial belongingness of things at hand.
The essential disclosure of space lies in the significance with which Da­
sein as heedful being-in is familiar.
Space that is disclosed with the worldliness of the world does not
yet have the characteristic of a pure manifold of three dimensions. In this
nearest disclosedness, space is still hidden as the pure wherein in which
points are ordered by measurement and the positions of things are
determined. With the phenomenon of the region we have already indi-

I.m

Being and Time

103

cated that for which space is discovered beforehand in Da-sein. We
understand the region as that to which the context of useful things at
hand possibly belongs, a context which can be encountered as some­
thing directional, that is, containing places and as de-distanced. The
belongingness is determined by the significance constitutive for the

Il l

world and articulates the here and there within the possible whereto.
The whereto in general is prefigured by the referential totality established in a for-the-sake-of-which of heedfulness. Freeing and letting
something be relevant is referred within this totality.

With

what is

encountered as things at hand, there is always relevance in a region. A
regional spatial relevance belongs to the totality of relevance which con­
stitutes the being of things at hand in the surrounding world. On the
basis of this relevance, things at hand can be found and determined
according to form and direction. In accordance with the possible trans­
parency of heedful circumspection, innerworldly things at hand are de­
dis tanced and oriented with the factical being of Da-sein.
Letting innerworldly beings be encountered, which is constitutive
for being-in-the-world, is "giving space. " This "giving space," which we
call

making room,

frees things at hand for their spatiality. As a way of dis­

covering and presenting a possible totality of places relevantly deter­
mined, making room makes actual factical orientation possible. As cir­
cumspect taking care of things in the world, Da-sein can change things
around, remove them or "make room" for them only because making
room-understood as an existential-belongs to its being-in-the-world.
But neither the previously discovered region nor the actual spatiality
in general are explicitly in view. In itself, it is present in the inconspicu­
ousness of things at hand being taken care of by a circumspection
absorbed in them for that circumspection. Space is initially discovered in
this spatiality with being-in-the-world. On the basis of the spatiality thus
discovered, space itself becomes accessible to cognition.

Space is neither in the subject nor is the world in space.

Rather, space is

"in" the world since the being-in-the-world constitutive for Da-sein has
disclosed space. Space is not in the subject, nor does that subject observe
the world "as if' it were in space. Rather, the " subj ect," correctly under­
stood ontologically , Da-sein, is spatial in a primordial sense. And because
Da-sein is spatial in the way described, space shows itself as

a priori.

This term does not mean something like belonging beforehand to an ini­
tially worldless subject which spins a space out of itself. Here, apriority
means the previousness of encountering space (as region) in the actual
encountering of things at hand in the surrounding world.
The spatiality of what is initially circumspectly encountered can
itself become thematic and the task of calculation and measurement
for circumspection, for example, in building a house and surveying

1 12

l.m

Being and Time

1 04

land. With this predominantly circumspect thematization of the spatial­
ity of the surrounding world, space in itself already comes to view in a
way. The space which thus shows itself can be studied by purely looking
at it if the former sole possibility of access to space, circumspect calcu­
lation, is given up. The " formal intuition" of space discovers pure pos­
s ibilities of spatial relations. Here there is a series of stages laying bare
pure homogeneous space, going from the pure morphology of spatial
shapes to

analysis situs and finally to

the purely metrical science of space.

In this present study we shall not consider how these are all intercon­
nected. 23 In our problematic we wish solely to establish ontologically
the phenomenal basis for the thematic discovery and working out of
pure space.
Where space is discovered non-circumspectly by just looking at it,
the regions of the surrounding world get neutralized to pure dimen­
sions. The places and the totality of places of useful things at hand,
which are circumspectly oriented, are reduced to a multiplicity of posi­
tions for random things. The spatiality of innerworldly things at hand
thus loses its character of relevance. The world loses its specific charac­
ter of aroundness , the surrounding world becomes the natural world.
"The world" as a totality of useful things at hand is spatialized to become
a connection of extended things which are merely objectively present.
The homogeneous space of nature shows itself only when the beings we
encounter are discovered in such a way that the worldly character of
what is at hand gets specifically deprived of its worldliness.
In accordance with i ts being-in-the-world, Da-sein has always
already been pre-given its discovered space, even if unthematically . On
the other hand, space in itself is initially still obscured with regard to the
mere possibilities of the pure spatial being of something contained in it.
The fact that space essentially

shows

itself in

a world does

not tell us any­

thing about its kind of being. It need not have the kind of being of
s omething itself at hand in space or obj ectively present. Nor does the
being of space have the kind of being of Da-sein. From the fact that the
being of space itself cannot be conceived as the kind of being of

extensa,
1 13

res

it follows neither that it must be ontologically determined as

"phenomenon" of this res-it would not be distinguished from that

res in
res

its being-nor that the being of space can be equated with that of the

cogitans and be

conceived as something merely "subjective," quite apart

from the questionability of the

being of this

subject.

The perplexity s till present today with regard to the interpreta­
tion of the being of space is grounded not so much in an inadequate
knowledge of the factual constitution of space itself as in the lack of a
fundamental transparency of the possibilities of being in general and of
their ontologically conceived interpretation. What is decisive for the

1.111

Being and Time

105

understanding of the ontological problem of space lies in freeing the
question of the being of space from the narrowness of the accidentally
available and, moreover, undifferentiated concepts of being, and, with
respect to the phenomenon itself, in moving the problematic of the
being of space and the various phenomenal spatialities in the direction
of clarifying the possibilities of being in general.
The primary ontological character of the being of innerworldly
beings is not found in the phenomenon of space, either as unique or as
one among others. Still less does space constitute the phenomenon of
world. Space can only be understood by going back to the world. Space
does not become accessible only by depriving the surrounding world of
its worldliness. Spatiality can be discovered in general only on the basis
of world in such a way that space, after

all, also constitutes the world in

accordance with the essential spatiality of Da-sein itself with regard to its
fundamental constitution of being-in-the-world.

IV
Being-in-the- World as Being-with
and Being a Self: The "They "

The analysis of the worldliness of the world continually brought the
whole phenomenon of being-in-the-world into view without thereby
delimiting all of its constitutive factors with the same phenomenal clar­
ity as the phenomenon of world itself. The ontological interpretation of
the world which discussed innerworldly things at hand came first not
only because Da-sein in its everydayness is in a world in general and
remains a constant theme with regard to that world, but because it
relates itself to the world in a predominant mode of being. Initially and
for the most part, Da-sein is taken in by its world. This mode of being,
being absorbed in the world, and thus being-in which underlies it, essentially determine the phenomenon which we shall now pursue with the
question: Who is it who is in the everydayness of Da-sein? All of the
structures of being of Da-sein, thus also the phenomenon that answers to
this question of who, are modes of its being. Their ontological charac­
teristic is an existential one. Thus, we need to pose the question correctly
and outline the procedure for bringing to view a broader phenomenal
domain of the everydayness of Da-sein. By investigating in the direction of the phenomenon which all ows us to answer the question of the
who, we are led to structures of Da-sein which are equiprimordial with
being-in-the-world: being-with and Mitda-sein. In this kind of being, the
mode of everyday being a self is grounded whose explication makes visible what we might call the "subject" of everydayness, the they. This
chapter on the "who" of average Da-sein thus has the following structure:

(sec­

The Approach to the Existential Q}lestion of the Who of Da-sein

The answer to the question of who this being actually is (Da-sein) seems
to have already been given with the formal indication of the basic char­
acteristics of Da-sein ( cf. section 9). Da-sein is a being which I myself am,
its being is in each case mine. This determination

indicates an ontological

constitution, but no more than that. At the same time, it contains an

ontic

indication, albeit an undifferentiated one, that an I is always this

being, and not others. The who is answered in terms of the I itself, the
" subject, " the " self." The who is what maintains itself in the changes
throughout its modes of behavior and experiences as something identi­
cal and is, thus, related to this multiplicity. Ontologically, we under­
stand it as what is always already and constantly objectively present in a
closed region and for that region, as that which lies at its basis in an emi­
nent sense, as the

subjectum.

As something self-same in manifold other­

ness, this subj ect has the character of the

self.

Even if one rejects a sub­

stantial soul, the thingliness of consciousness and the objectivity of the
person, ontologically one still posits something whose being retains the
meaning of obj ective presence, whether explicitly or not. Substantiality
is the ontological clue for the determination of beings in terms of whom
the question of the who is answered. Da-sein is tacitly conceived in

1 15

advance as obj ective presence. In any case, the indeterminacy of its
being always implies this meaning of being. However, objective pres­
ence is the mode of being of beings unlike Da-sein.
The ontic obviousness of the statement that it is I who is in each
case Da-sein must not mislead us into supposing that the way for an
ontological interpretation of what is thus "given" has been unmistak­
ably prescribed. It is even questionable whether the ontic content of
the above statement reaches the phenomenal content of everyday Da­
sein. It could be the case that the who of everyday Da-sein is precisely

not

I myself.
Even when we

manage

to gain ontic and ontological statements, if

the phenomenal demonstration in terms of the mode of being of beings
is to retain priority over the most obvious and usual answers and the
problems arising from these, the phenomenological interpretation of
Da-sein must be protected from a distortion of the problematic with
regard to the question to be raised now.
But does it not go against the rules of a sound method when the
approach to a problematic does not stick to the evident data of the the-

I.IV

Being and Time

1 09

matic realm? And what is less dubious than the givenness of the I? And
(for the purpose of working this givenness out in a primordial way)
does it not direct us to abstract from everything else that is "given," not
only from an existing "world, " but also from the being of the other
" l"'s? Perhaps what gives this kind of giving, this simple, formal, reflec­
tive perception of the I, is indeed evident. This insight even opens access
to an independent phenomenological problematic which has its funda­
mental significance in the framework known as "formal phenomenology
of consciousness."
In the present context of an existential analytic of factical Da-sein,
the question arises whether the way of the giving of the I which we men­
tioned discloses Da-sein in its everydayness, if it discloses it at all. Is it
then

a priori self-evident

that the access to Da-sein must be simple per­

ceiving reflection of the I of acts? What if this kind of "self-giving" of Da­
sein were to lead our existential analytic astray and do so in a way
grounded in the being of Da-sein itself? Perhaps when Da-sein addresses
itself in the way which is nearest to itself, it always says it is I, and finally
says this most loudly when it is "not" this being. What if the fact that Dasein is so constituted that it is in each case mine, were the reason for the
fact that Da-sein

is,

initiall y and for the most part,

not itselfl

What if,

with the approach mentioned above, the existential analytic fell into
the trap, so to speak, of starting with the givenness of the I for Da-sein
itself and its obvious self-interpretation? What if it should turn out that
the ontological horizon for the determination of what is accessible in
simple giving should remain fundamentally undetermined? We can
probably always correctly say ontically of this being that "I" am it. However, the ontological analytic which makes use of such statements must
have fundamental reservations about them. The "I" must be understood
only in the sense of a noncommittal formal indication of something which
perhaps reveals itself in the actual phenomenal context of being as that
being's "opposite." Then "not I" by no means signifies something like a
being which is essentially lacking "1-hood, " but means a definite mode of
being of the "I" itself; for example, having lost itself. *
But even the positive interpretation of Da-sein that has been given
up to now already forbids a point of departure from the formal given­
ness of the I if the intention is to find a phenomenally adequate answer
to the question of value. The clarification of being-in-the-world showed
that a mere subject without a world "is" not initially and is also never
given. And, thus, an isolated I without the others is in the end just as far
from being given initially! But if the "others"

us in

being-in-the-world, ascertaining this phenomenally, too, must not

mislead us into thinking that the

ontological

structure of what is thus

"given" is self-evident and not in need of an investigation. The task is to
make this

Mitda-sein

of the nearest everydayness phenomenally visible

and to interpret it in an ontologically adequate way.
Just as the antic, self-evident character of being-in-itself of inner­
worldly beings misleads us to the convic tion of the ontological self-evi­
dent character of the meaning of this being and makes us overlook the
phenomenon of world, the antic, self-evident character that Da-sein is

lematic indigenous to it might be led astray.
is not only a problem

117

ontologically,

Initially

the who of Da-sein

it also remains concealed

ontically.

But, then, is the existential analytical answer to the question of the
who without any clues at all? By no means. To be sure, of the formal indi­
cations of the constitution of being of Da-sein given above (sections
and

12),

9

it is not so much the one which we discussed which is functional,

b u t rather, the one according to which the " e s s ence" of D a-s ein is
grounded in its existence. If the

"I " is an essential determination ofDa-sein, it

must be interpreted existentially.

The question of the who can then be

answered only by a phenomenal demonstration of a definite kind of being
of Da-sein. If Da-sein is always only its self

in existing,

the constancy of

the self as well as its possible "inconstancy" require an existential-onto­
logical kind of questioning as the only adequate access to the problematic.
But if the self is conceived " only" as a way of the being of this
being, then that seems tantamount to volatizing the true "core" of Da­
sein. But such fears are nourished by the incorrect preconception that
the being in question really has, after all, the kind of being of s ome­
thing obj ectively present, even if one avoids attributing to it the massive
element of a corporeal thing. However, the
is not the spirit as the synthesis

"substance" of human being
of body and soul, but existence.

26. The Mitda-sein of the Others and Everyday Being-with
The answer to the question of the who of everyday Da-sein is to be won
through the analysis of the kind of being in which Da-sein, initially and
for the most part, lives. Our inves tigation takes its orientation from
being-in-the-world. This fundamental constitution of Da-sein determines
every mode of its being. If we justifiably stated that all other structural
factors of being-in-the-world already came into view by means of the
previous explication of the world, the answer to the question of the
who mus t also be prepared by that explication.
The "description" of the surrounding world nearest to us, for exam­
ple, the work-world of the handworker, showed that together with the

I.JV

Being and Time

111

useful things found in work, others are "also encountered" for whom the
"work" is to be done. In the kind of being of these things at hand, that is,
in their relevance, there lies an essential reference to possible wearers for
whom they should be "cut to the figure. " Similarly, the producer or "sup­
plier" is encountered in the material used as one who "serves" well or
badly. The field, for example, along which we walk "outside" shows itself
as belonging to such and such a person who keeps it in good order, the
book which we use is bought at such and such a place, given by such
and such a person, and so on. The boat anchored at the shore refers in its
being-in-itself to an acquaintance who undertakes his voyages with it, but
as a "boat strange to us, " it also points to others. The others who are
"encountered" in the context of useful things in the surrounding world at
hand are not somehow added on in thought to an initially merely objectively present thing, but these "things" are encountered from the world in
which they are at hand for the others. This world is always already from
the outset my own. In our previous analysis, the scope of what is encountered in the world was initially narrowed down to useful things at hand,
or nature objectively present, thus to beings of a character unlike Da-sein.
This restriction was not only necessary for the purpose of simplifying
the explication; but, above all, because the kind of being of the existence
of the others encountered within the surrounding world is distinct from
handiness and objective presence. The world of Da-sein thus frees beings
which are not only completely different from tools and things, but which
themselves in accordance with their kind of being as Da-sein are themselves "in" the world as being-in-the-world in which they are at the same
time encountered. These beings are neither objectively present nor at
hand, but they are like the very Da-sein which frees them-they are there, too,
and there with it. So, if one wanted to identify the world in general with
innerworldly beings, one would have to say the "world" is also Da-sein.
But the characteristic of encountering the others is, after all, ori­
ented toward one's own Da-sein. Does not it, too, start with the distinc­
tion and isolation of the "I," so that a transition from this isolated subject
to the others must then be sought? In order to avoid this misunder­
standing, we must observe in what sense we are talking about " the oth­
ers." "The others" does not mean everybody else but me-those from
whom the I distinguishes itself. They are, rather, those from whom one
mostly does not distinguish oneself, those among whom one is, too.
This being-there-too with them does not have the ontological character
of being objectively present "with" them within a world. The "with" is of
the character of Da-sein, the "also" means the sameness of being as cir­
cumspect, heedful being-in-the-world. "With" and "also" are to be under­
stood existentially, not categorially. On the basis of this like·with being-in­
the-world, the world is always already the one that I share with the

others. The world of Da-sein is a

with-world.

The innerworldly being-in-itself of others is

Mitda-sein.

The others are not encountered by grasping and previously discriminating one's own subject, initially objectively present, from other
subjects also present. They are not encountered by first looking at one­
self and then ascertaining the opposite pole of a distinction. They are
encountered from the

world in which Da-sein,

heedful and circumspect,

essentially dwells. As opposed to the theoretically concocted "explana­
tions" of the objective presence of others which easily urge themselves
upon us, we must hold fast to the phenomenal fact which we have indi­
cated of their being encountered in the

surrounding world.

This nearest

and elemental way of Da-sein of being encountered in the world goes so
far that even one's

ing away from its

own Da-sein initially becomes

"discoverable" by

look­

"experiences" and the "center of its actions" or by not

yet "seeing" them all . Da-sein initially finds "itself' in

what it does, needs,
takes care of

expects, has charge of, in the things at hand which it initially
in the surrounding world.

And even when Da-sein explicitly addresses itself as "I here," the
locative personal designation must be understood in terms of the exis­
tential spatiality of Da-sein. When we interpreted this (section

23),

we

already intimated that this I-here does not mean an eminent point of an
I-thing, but as being-in is to be understood in terms of the over there of
the world at hand where Da-sein dwells in

W. V.

taking care.

Humboldt2 has alluded to certain languages which express

the "I" by "here," the "thou" by " there," and the "he" by "over there, "
thus rendering the personal pronouns b y locative adverbs, t o put i t
grammatically . It is controversial whether th e primordial meaning o f
locative expressions i s adverbial o r pronominal. This dispute loses i ts
basis i f one notes that locative adverbs have a relation to the I qua Da­
sein. The " here, " "over there," and " there" are not primarily pure loca­
tive designati�ns of innerworldly beings objectively present at positions
in space, but, rather, characteristics of the primordial spatiality of Da­
sein. The supposedly locative adverbs are determinations of Da-sein;
they have primarily an existential, not a categorial, meaning. But they are
not pronouns, either. Their significance is prior to the distinction of
locative adverbs and personal pronouns. The true spatial meaning of
these expressions for Da-sein, however, documents the fact that the the-

120

oretically undistorted interpretation of Da-sein sees the latter immedi­
ately in its spatial "being-together-with" the world taken care of, spatial in
the sense of de-distancing and directionality. In the "here" Da-sein,
absorbed in its world, does not address itself, but speaks away from
itself, in circumspection, to the "over there" of something at hand and
means, however,

itself in its

existential spatiality.

I . IV

Being and Time

Da-sein understands itself, initially and for the most part, in terms
of its world, and the Mitda-sein of others is frequently encountered from
innerworldly things at hand. But when the others become, so to speak,
thematic in their Da-sein, they are not encountered as objectively present
thing-persons, but we meet them "at work," that is, primarily in their
being-in-the-world. Even when we see the other "just standing around,"
he is never understood as a human-thing objectively present. "Stand­
ing around" is an existential mode of being, the lingering with every­
thing and nothing which lacks heedfulness and circumspection. The
other is encountered in his

Mitda-sein in

the world.

But, after all, the expression "Da-sein" clearly shows that this being is
"initially" unrelated to others, that it can, of course, also be "with" others
subsequently. But we must not overlook the fact that we are also using the
tenn Mitda-sein as a designation

of the being to which the existing others
Mitda-sein of others is disclosed only
and thus also for those who are Mitda-sein,

are freed within the world. The
within the world for a Da-sein

because Da-sein in itself is essentially being-with. The phenomenological
statement that Da-sein is essentially being-with has an existential-ontolog­
ical meaning. It does not intend to ascertain ontically that I am factically
not objectively present alone, rather that others of my kind also are. If the
statement that the being-in-the-world of Da-sein is essentially constituted by
being-with meant something like this, being-with would not be an exis­
tential attribute that belongs to Da-sein of itself on the basis of its kind of
being, but something which occurs at times on the basis of the existence of
others. Being-with existentially determines Da-sein even when an other is
not factically present and perceived. The being-alone of Da-sein, too, is
being-with in the world. The other can be

lacking only in and for a being­

with. Being-alone is a deficient mode of being-with, its possibility is a
proof for the latter. On the other hand, factical being alone is not changed
by the fact that a second copy of a human being is "next to" me, or per­
haps ten human beings. Even when these and still more are objectively
present, Da-sein can be alone. Thus, being-with and the facti city of being­
with-one-another are not based on the fact that several "subjects" are
physically there together. Being alone "among" many, however, does not
mean wi th respect to the being of others that they are simply objectively
present. Even in being "among them," they are

there with.

Their Mitda-sein

is encountered in the mode of indifference and being alien. Lacking and
"being away" are modes of Mitda-sein and are possible only because Dasein as being-with lets the Da-sein of others be encountered in its world.
Being-with is an attribute of one's own Da-sein. Mitda-sein characterizes the
Da-sein of others in that it is freed for a being-with by the world of that
being-with. Only because it has the essential structure of being-with, is
one's own Da-sein Mitda-sein as encounterable by others.

121

If Mitda-sein remains existentially constitutive for being-in-the­
world, it must be interpreted, as must also circumspect association with
the innerworldly things at hand which we characterized by way of antic­
ipation as taking care of things, in terms of the phenomenon of care
which we used to designate the being of Da-sein in general. (Cf. chapter
6 of this division.) Taking care of things is a character of being which
being-with cannot have as its own, although this kind of being is a being
toward beings encountered in the world, as is taking care of things. The
being to which Da-sein is related as being-with does not, however, have
the kind of being of useful things at hand; it is itself Da-sein. This being
is not taken care of, but is a matter of concern.
Even "taking care" of food and clothing, the nursing of the sick
body is concern. But we understand this expression in a way which cor­
responds to our use of taking care of things as a term for an existential.
For example, "welfare work," as a factic(\1 social institution, is based on
the constitution of being of Da-sein as being-with. Its factical urgency is
motivated by the fact that Da-sein initially and, for the most part, lives in
the deficient modes of concern. Being for-, against-, and without-one­
another, passing-one-another-by, not-mattering-to-one-another, are pos­
sible ways of concern. And precisely the last named modes of deficiency
and indifference characterize the everyday and average being-with-one­
another. These modes of being show the characteristics of inconspicu­
ousness and obviousness which belong to everyday innerworldly Mitda­
sein of others, as well as to the handiness of useful things taken care of
daily. These indifferent modes of being-with-one-another tend to mislead
the ontological interpretation into initially interpreting this being as the
pure objective presence of several subjects. It seems as if only negligible
variations of the same kind of being lie before us, and yet ontologically
there is an essential distinction between the "indifferent" being together
of arbitrary things and the not-mattering-to-one-another of beings who
are with one another.
With regard to its positive modes, concern has two extreme possi­
bilities. It can, so to speak, take the other's "care" away from him and
put itself in his place in taking care, it can leap in for him. Concern
takes over what is to be taken care of for the other. The other is thus dis­
placed, he s teps back so that afterwards, when the matter has been
attended to, he can take it over as something finished and available or
disburden himself of it completely. In this concern, the other can
become one who is dependent and dominated even if this domination is
a tacit one and remains hidden from him. This kind of concern which
does the job and takes away "care" is, to a large extent, determinative for
being with one another and pertains, for the most part, to our taking
care of things at hand.

I.IV

Being and Time

115

In contrast to this, there is the possibility o f a concern which does
not so much leap in for the other as leap ahead of him, not in order to
take "care" away from him, but to first to give it back to him as such.
This concern which essentially pertains to authentic care; that is, the
existence of the other, and not to a what which it takes care of, helps the
other to become transparent to himself in his care and free for it.
Concern proves to be constitutive of the being of Da-sein which, in
accordance with its different possibilities, is bound up with its being
toward the world taken care of and also with its authentic being toward
itself. Being-with-one-another is based initially and often exclusively on
what is taken care of together in such being. A being-with-one-another
which arises from one's doing the same thing as someone else not only
keeps for the most part within outer limits but enters the mode of dis­
tance and reserve. The being-with-one-ano ther of those who are
employed for the same thing often thrives only on mistrust. On the
other hand, when they devote themselves to the same thing in com­
mon, their doing so is determined by their Da-sein, which has been
stirred. This authentic alliance first makes possible the proper kind of
objectivity which frees the other for himself in his freedom.
Between the two extremes of positive concern-the one which does
someone's j ob for him and dominates him, and the one which is in
advance of him and frees him-everyday being-with-one-another main­
tains itself and shows many mixed forms whose description and classifi­
cation lie outside of the limits of this investigation.
Just as circumspection belongs to taking care of things as a way of
discovering things at hand, concern is guided by considerateness and tol·
erance. With concern, both can go through the deficient and indifferent
modes up to the point of inconsiderateness and the tolerance which is
guided by indifference.
The world not only frees things at hand as beings encountered
within the world, but also Da-sein, the others in their Mitda-sein. But in
accordance with its own meaning of being, this being which is freed in
the surrounding world is being-in in the same world in which, as encoun­
terable for others, it is there with them. Worldliness was interpreted
(section 18) as the referential totality of significance. In being familiar
with this significance and previously understanding it, Da-sein lets things
at hand be encountered as things discovered in their relevance. The
referential context of significance is anchored in the being of Da-sein
toward its ownmost being-a being which cannot be in a relation of rel­
evance, but which is rather the being for the sake of which Da-sein itself is
as it is.
But, according to the analysis which we have now completed,
being-with-others belongs to the being of Da-sein, with which it is con-

123

1 16

I. IV

Being and Time

cemed in its very being. As being-with, Da-sein "is" essentially for the
sake of others. 1bis must be understood as an existential statement as to
its essence. But when actual, factical Da-sein does

not tum to others and
is in the mode of

thinks that it does not need them, or misses them, it

being-with. In being-with as the existential for-the-sake-of-others, these
others are already disclosed in their Da-sein. 1bis previously constituted
disclosedness of others together with being-with thus helps to consti­
tute significance, that is, worldliness. As this worldliness, disclosedness is
anchored in the existential for-the-sake-of-which. Hence the worldliness
of the world thus constituted in which Da-sein always already essentially
is, lets things at hand be encountered in the surrounding world in such
a way that the Mitda-sein of others is encountered at the same time with
them as circumspectly taken care of. The structure of the worldliness of
the world is such that o thers are not initially objectively present as
unattached subjects along with other things, but show themselves in
their heedful being in the surrounding world in terms of the things at
hand in that world.
The disclosedness of the

Mitda-sein

of others which belongs to

being-with means that the understanding of others already lies in the
understanding of being of Da-sein because its being is being-with. This
understanding, like all understanding, is not a knowledge derived from
cognition, but a primordially existential kind of being which first makes

1 24

knowledge and cognition possible. Knowing oneself is grounded in pri­
mordially understanding being-with. It operates initially in accordance
with the nearest kind of being of being-together-in-the-world in the
understanding knowledge of what Da-sein circumspectly finds and takes
care of with the others. Concemful taking care of things is understood in
terms of what is taken care of and with an understanding of them. Thus
the other is initially disclosed in the taking care of concern.
But because concern, initially and for the most part, dwells in the
deficient or at least indifferent modes-in the indifference of passing­
one-another-by-a nearest and essential knowing oneself is in need of a
getting-to-know-oneself. And when even knowing oneself loses itself in
aloofness, concealing oneself and misrepresenting oneself, being-with­
one-another requires special ways in order to come near to the others or
to "see through them."
But just as opening oneself up or closing oneself off are grounded
in the actual mode of being of being-with-one-another, in fact

is nothing

besides this mode itself, even the explicit disclosure of the other in con­
cern grows only out of one's primarily being-with him. Such a disclosure
of the other which is indeed

thematic,

but not in the mode of theoretical

psychology, easily becomes the phenomenon that first comes to view for
the theoretical problematic of understanding the "psychical life of oth-

I. IV

Being and Time

117

ers." What "initially" presents phenomenally a way o f being-with-one­
another that understands-is at the same time, however, taken to mean
that which "originally" and primordially makes possible and constitutes
being toward others. This phenomenon, which is none too happily des­
ignated as

"empathy,"

is then supposed, as it were, to provide the first

ontological bridge from one's own subject, initially given by itself, to
the other subject, which is initially quite inaccessible.
To be sure, being-toward-others is ontologically different from
being toward obj ectively present things. The "other" being itself has
the kind of being of Da-sein. Thus, in being with and toward others,
there is a relation of being from Da-sein to Da-sein. But, one would like
to say, this relation is, after all , already constitutive for one's own Da-sein,
which has an understanding of its own being and is thus related to Da­
sein. The relation of being to others then becomes a projection of one's
own being toward oneself "into an other." The other is a double of the
self.
But it is easy to see that this seemingly obvious deliberation has lit­
tle ground to stand on. The presupposition which this argument makes
use of-that the being of Da-sein toward itself is a being toward anotheris incorrect. As long as the presupposition has not been demonstrated
clearly in its legitimacy, it remains puzzling how the relation of Da-sein to
itself is to disclose the other as other.
Being toward others is not only an autonomous irreducible rela­
tion of being, as being-with it already exists with the being of Da-sein. Of
course, it is indisputable that a lively mutual acquaintanceship on the
basis of being-with often depends on how far one's own Da-sein has
actually understoo d its elf, but this means that it depends only upon
how far one's essential being with others has made it transparent and
not disguised itself. This is possible only if Da-sein as being-in-the-world
is always already with others. "Empathy" does not first constitute being­
with, but is first possible on its basis, and is motivated by the prevailing
modes of being-with in their inevitability.
But the fact that " empathy" is not an original existential phe­
nomenon, any more than is knowing in general, does not mean that
there is no problem here. Its special hermeneutic will have to show how
the various possibilities of being of Da-sein themselves mislead and
obstruct being-with-one-another and its self-knowledge, so that a gen­
uine "understanding" is suppressed and Da-sein takes refuge in surro­
gates; this positive existential condition presupposes a correct under­
standing of the stranger for its possibility. Our analysis has shown that
being-with is an existential constituent of being-in-the-world.

Mitda-sein

has proved to be a manner of being which beings encountered within the
world have as their own. In that Da-sein

is at all,

it has the kind of being of

1 25

1 18

Being and Time

I. IV

being-with-one-another. Being-with-one-another cannot be understood
as a summative result of the occurrence of several "subjects." Encoun­
tering a number of "subjects" itself is possible only by treating the others
encountered in their Mitda-sein merely as "numerals." This number is
discovered only by a definite being with and toward one another. "Incon­
siderate" being-with "reckons" with others without seriously "counting on
them" or even wishing "to have anything to do" with them.
One's own Da-sein, like the Mitda-sein of others, is encountered,
initially and for the most part, in terms of the world-together in the sur­
rounding world taken care of. In being absorbed in the world of taking
care of things, that is, at the same time in being-with toward others, Da­
sein is not itself. Who is it, then, who has taken over being as everyday
being-with-one-another?

126

2 7. Everyday Being One 's Self and the They

The ontologically relevant result of the foregoing analysis of being-with is
the insight that the "subj ect character" of one's own Da-sein and of the
others is to be defined existentially, that is, in terms of certain ways to
be. In what is taken care of in the surrounding world, the others are
encountered as what they are; they are what they do.
In taking care of the things which one has taken hold of, for, and
against o thers, there is constant care as to the way one differs from
them, whether this difference is to be equalized, whether one's own Da­
sein has lagged behind others and wants to catch up in relation to them,
whether Da-sein in its priority over others is intent on suppressing them.
Being-with-one-another is, unknown to itself, disquieted by the care
about this distance. Existentially expressed, being-with-one-another has
the character of distantiality. The more inconspicuous this kind of being
is to everyday Da-sein itself, all the more stubbornly and primordially
does it work itself out.
But this distantiality which belongs to being-with is such that, as
everyday being-with-one-another, Da-sein stands in subservience to the
others. It itself is not; the others have taken its being away from it. The
everyday possibilities of being of Da-sein are at the disposal of the whims
of the o thers. These others are not definite others. On the contrary, any
other can represent them. What is decisive is only the inconspicuous
domination by others that Da-sein as being-with has already taken over
unawares . One belongs to the others oneself, and entrenches their
power. "The others," whom one designates as such in order to cover
over one's own essential belonging to them, are those who are there ini­
tially and for the most part in everyday being-with-one-another. The
who is not this one and not that one, not oneself and not some and

I.IV

Being and Time

not the sum of them all. The "who" is the neuter,

1 19

the they.

We have shown earlier how the public " surrounding world" is
always already at hand and taken care of in the surrounding world near­
est to us. In utilizing public transportation, in the use of information ser­
vices such as the newspaper, every other is like the next. This being­
with-one-another dissolves one's own Da-sein completely into the kind of
being of "the others " in such a way that the others, as distinguishable
and explicit, disappear more and more. In this inconspicuousness and
unascertainability, the they unfolds its true dictatorship. We enjoy our­
selves and have fun the way

they

enjoy themselves. We read, see, and

judge literature and art the way they see and judge. But we also withdraw
from th e "great mass" th e way

they

they

withdraw, w e find "shocking" what

find shocking. The they, which is nothing definite and which all

are, though not as a sum, prescribes the kind of being of everydayness.
The they has its own ways to be. The tendency of being-with which
we calle d distantiality is based on the fact that being-with-one-another as
such create\_averagemu:J it is an existential character of the they. In its
being, the they is essentially concerned with averageness . Thus, the they
maintains itself factically in the averageness of what is proper, what is
allowed, and what is not. Of what is granted success and what is not.
This averageness, which prescribes what can and may be ventured,
watches over every exception which thrusts itself to the fore. Every pri­
ority is noiselessly squashed. Overnight, everything primordial is flat­
tened down as something long since known. Everything gained by a
struggle becomes something to be manipulated. Every mystery loses its
power. The care of averageness reveals, in turn, an essential tendency of
Da-sein, which we call the

levelling down of all possibilities

of being.

Distantiality, averageness, and levelling down, as ways of being of
the they, constitute what we know as "publicness." Publicness initially
controls every way in which the world and Da-sein are interpreted, and
it is always right, not because of an eminent and primary relation of
being to " things , " not because it has an explicitly appropriate trans­
parency of Da-sein at its disposal, but because it does not get to "the
heart of the matter, " because it is insensitive to every difference of level
and genuineness. Publicness obscures everything, and then claims that
what has been thus covered over is what is familiar and accessible to
everybody.
The they is everywhere, but in such a way that it has always already
stolen away when Da-sein presses for a decision. However, because the
they presents every judgment and decision as its own, it takes the respon­
sibility of Da-sein away from it. The they can, as it were, manage to have
"them" constantly invoking it. It

can

most easily be responsible for every­

thing because no one has to vouch for anything. The they always "did it,"

127

120

I . IV

Being and Time

and yet it can be said that "no one" did it. In the everydayness of Da-sein,
most things happen in such a way that we must say "no one did it. "
Thus, the they

128

disburdens Da-sein i n its

everydayness . Not only that;

by disburdening it o f i ts being, the they accommodates Da-sein i n its ten­
dency to take things easily and make them easy. And since the they con­
s tantly accommodates Da-sein, it retains and entrenches its stubborn
dominance.
Everyone is the other, and no one is himself. The
plies the answer to the

who

of everyday Da-sein, is the

they, which sup­
nobody to whom

every Da-sein has always already surrendered itself, in its being-among­
one-another.
In these characteristics of being which we have discussed-everyday
being-among-one-another, distantiality, averageness, levelling down, pub­
licness, disburdening of one's being, and accommodation-lies the initial
" constancy" of Da-sein. This constancy pertains not to the enduring
objective presence of something, but to the kind of being of Da-sein as
being-with. Existing in the modes we have mentioned, the self of one's
own Da-sein and the self of the other have neither found nor lost them­
s elves. One is in the manner of dependency and inauthenticity. This
way of being does not signify a lessening of the facti city of Da-sein, just
as the they as the nobody is not nothing. On the contrary, in this kind of
being Da-sein is an ens

realissimum,

if by "reality" we understand a being

that is like Da-sein.
Of course, the they is as little objectively present as Da-sein itself.
The more openly the they behaves, the more slippery and hidden it is,
but the less is it nothing at all . To the unprejudiced ontic-ontological
"eye," it reveals itself as the "most real subj ect" of everydayness. And if it
is not accessible like an obj ectively present stone, that is not in the least
decisive about its kind of being. One may neither decree prematurely
that this they is "really " nothing, nor profess the opinion that the phe­
nomenon has been interpreted ontologically if one "explains" it as the
result of the obj ective presence of several subjects which one has put
together in hindsight. On the contrary, the elaboration of the concepts
of being must be guided by these indubitable phenomena.
Nor is the they something like a "universal subject" which hovers
over a plurality of subjects. One could understand it this way only if
the being of "subjects" is understood as something unlike Da-sein, and if
these are regarded as factually objectively present cases of an existing
genus. With this approach, the only possibility ontologically is to under­
stand everything which is not a case of this sort in the sense of genus and

1 29

species . The they is not the genus of an individual Da-sein, nor can it be
found in this being as

an

abiding characteristic. That traditional logic

also fails in the face of these phenomena, cann o t surprise us if we con-

I. IV

sider that i t has i ts foundation in an ontology o f objective presence-an
ontology which is still rough at that. Thus, it fundamentally cannot be
made more flexible no matter how many improvements and expansions
might be made. These reforms of logic, oriented toward the "humanis­
tic sciences," only increase the ontological confusion.

positive constitution of Da-sein. It itself has, in tum, various possibilities of

nance becomes penetrating and explicit may change historically .

as heedful absorption in the world nearest encountered. If

Da-sein

is

familiar with itself as the they-self, this also means that the they pre­
scribes the nearest interpretation of the world and of being-in-the-world.
The they itself, for the sake of which Da-sein is every day, articulates
the referential context of significance. The world of Da-sein frees the
beings encountered for a totality of relevance which is familiar to the
they in the limits which are established with the averageness of the they.

Initially, factical
way. Initially, "I"

Da-sein is in the with-world, discovered in an average
"am" not in the sense of my own self, but I am the oth­

ers in the mode of the they. In terms of the they, and as the they, I am
initially "given" to "myself." Initially, Da-sein is the they and for the
most part it remains so. If Da-sein explicitly discovers the world and
brings it near, if it discloses its authentic being to itself, this discovering
of "world" and disclosing of Da-sein always comes about by clearing
away coverings and obscurities, by breaking up the disguises with which
Da-sein cuts itself off from itself.
With this interpretation of being-with and being one's self in the
they, the question of the who in the everydayness of being-with-one­
another is answered. These considerations have at the same time given
us a concrete understanding of the basic constitution of Da-sein. Being­
in-the-world became visible in i ts everydayness and averageness.
Everyday Da-sein derives the pre-ontological interpretation of its
being from the nearest kind of being o f the they. The ontological inter­
pretation initially follows this tendency of interpretation, it understands
Da-sein in terms of the world and

rinds it there as an innerworldly being.

Not only this; the "nearest" ontology of Da-sein takes the meaning of
being on the basis of which these existing "subj ects" are understood
also in terms of the "world." But since the phenomenon of world itself is
passed over in this absorption in the world, it is replaced by objective
presence in the world, by things. The being of beings, which is

there,

130

1 22

Being and Time

I. tv

too, is understood as objective presence. Thus, by showing the positive
phenomenon of nearest, everyday being-in-the-world, we have made
possible an insight into the root of missing the ontological interpretation
of this constitution of being. It itself, in its everyday kind of being, is
what initially misses itself and covers itself over.
If the being of everyday being-with-one-another, which seems onto­
logically to approach pure objective presence, is really fundamentally dif.
ferent from that kind of presence, still less can the being of the authen­
tic self be understood as objective presence. Authentic being one:S self is
not based on an exceptional state of the subject, a state detached from
the they, but is an existentiell modification of the they as an essential existential.
But, then, the sameness of the authentically existing self is sepa­
rated ontologically by a gap from the identity of the I maintaining itself
in the multiplicity of its "experiences ."

28. The Task of a Thematic Analysis of Being-in

In the preparatory stage of the existential analytic of Da-sein we have for
our leading theme this being's basic constitution, being-in-the-world.
Our first aim is to bring into relief phenomenally the unitary primordial
structure of the being of Da-sein by which its possibilities and ways "to
be" are ontologically determined. Until now, the phenomenal charac­
terization of being-in-the-world has been directed toward the structural
moment of the world and has attempted to provide an answer to the
question of the who of this being in its everydayness . But in first sketching out the tasks of a preparatory fundamental analysis of Da-sein we
already provided an orientation to being-in as such' and demonstrated it
by the concrete mode of knowing the world. 2
We anticipated this sustaining structural moment with the inten­
tion of relating the analysis of individual moments, from the outset,
with a steady view to the structural whole, and with the intention of
p reventing any disruption and fragmentation of the unitary phe­
nomenon. Now, keeping in mind what has been achieved in the con­
crete analysis of world and who, we must turn our interpretation back to
the phenomenon of being-in. By considering this more penetratingly,
however, we shall not only get a new and more certain phenomenolog­
ical view of the structural totality of being-in-the-world, but shall also
pave the way to grasping the primordial being of Da-sein itself, care.
But what more is there to point out in being-in-the-world, beyond
the essential relations of being together with the world ( taking care of

1 24

Being and Time

things}, being-with (concern}, and being one's self (who)? There is still
the possibility of broadening the analysis by comparing the variations of
taking care and its circumspection, of concern and its considerateness,
and of distinguishing Da-sein from all beings unlike Da-sein by a more
precise explication of the being of all possible innerworldly beings. With­
out question, there are unfinished tasks in this direction. What we h ave
set forth so far needs to be supplemented in many ways with respect to
a full elaboration of the existential

a priori

of philosophical anthropol­

ogy. But this is not the aim of our investigation.

mental ontolog;y.

Its aim is that ofJunda·

If we thus inquire into being-in thematically, we cannot

be willing to null i fy the primordiality of the phenomenon by deriving it
from others, that is, by an inappropriate analysis in the sense of dis­
solving it. But the fact that we canno t derive something primordial does
not exclude a multiplicity of characteristics of being constitutive for it. If
thes e characteristics show themselves, they are existentially equipri­
mordial. The phenomenon of the equiprimordiality of constitutive factors
has often been disregarded in ontology on account of a methodically
unrestrained tendency to derive everything and anything from a simple
"primordial ground. "

1 32

In which direction must we look for the phenomenal characteristics of being-in as such? We get the answer to this question by recalling
what we were charged with keeping in view phenomenologically when
we pointed out this phenomenon: being-in in contradistinction to the
objectively present insideness of something objectively present "in" an
other; being-in not as an attribute of an objectively present subject
effected or even initiated by the obj ective presence of the "world";
rather, being-in essentially as the kind of being of this being itself. But
then what else presents itself with this phenomenon o ther than the
objectively present

commercium between

an objectively present subj ect

and an objectively present object? This interpretation would come closer
to the phenomenal content if it stated that Da-sein

is the being

of this

"between. " Nonetheless, the orientation toward the "between" would
still be misleading. It colludes unawares with the ontologically indefinite
approach that there are beings between which this between as such "is . "
The between i s already understood a s the result o f the

convenientia

of

two objectively present things. But this kind of approach always already

splits

the phenomenon beforehand, and there is no prospect of ever

again putting it back together from the fragments. Not only do we lack
the " cement, " even the " s chema" according to whi ch this j oining
together is to be accomplished has been split apart, or never as yet
unveiled. What is ontologically decisive is to avoid splitting the phe­
nomenon beforehand, that is, to secure its positive phenomenal content.
The fact that extensive and complicated preparations are necessary for

Being and Time

I.v

1 25

thi s, o nly shows that something ontically self-evident in the traditional
treatment of the "problem of knowledge" was ontologically distorted in
many ways to the point of becoming invisible.
The being which is essentially constituted by being-in-the-world

is

itself always its "there." According to the familiar meaning of the word,
"there" points to "here" and "over there. " The "here" of an "I-here" is
always understood in terms of an "over there" at hand in the sense of
being toward it which de-distances, is directional, and takes care. The
existential spatiality of Da-sein which determines its "place" for it in this
way is itself based upon being-in-the-world. The over there is the deter­
minateness of something encountered within the world. "Here" and
"over there" are possible only in a " there," that is, when there is a being
which has disclosed spatiality as the being of the there . " This being
bears in i ts ownmost being the character of not being closed. The
expression " there" means this essential disclosedness. Through dis­
closedness this being (Da-sein) is "there" for itself together with the Da­
sein of the world.
When we talk in an ontically figurative way about the

rale in human

lumen natu-

being, w e mean nothing other than th e existential-onto­

logical structure of this being, the fact that it

is in the mode

of being its

there. To say that it is "illuminated" means that it is cleared* in itself as
being-in-the-world, not by another being, but in such a way that it

is

itself the clearing. t Only for a being thus existentially do objectively present things become accessible in the light or concealed in darkness. By
its very nature, Da-sein brings its there along with it. If it lacks its there,
it is not only factically not of this nature, but not at all a being.

Da-sein is

its disclosure. t
We must set forth the constitution of this being. But since the
nature of this being is existence, the existential statement that "Da-sein

is

its disclosure" means at the same time that the being about which these
beings are concerned in their being is to be their "there." In addition to
characterizing the primary constitution of the being of disclosure, we
must, in accordance with the character of our analysis, interpret the
kind of being in which this being is its there in an

everyday way.

This chapter, which undertakes the explication of being-in as such,
that is, of the being of the there, has two parts : (A) The existential con­
s titution of the there. ( B ) The everyday being of the there and the
entanglement' of Da-sein.

existential one. This means that the characteristics are not properties of
something objectively present, but essentially existential ways to b e .
Thus, their kind of being i n everydayness must be brought out.

A. THE EXISTENTIAL CONSTITIITION OF THE THERE
29. Da-sein

as

What we indicate

Attunement

ontologically with the

term

attunement is ontically what is

most familiar and an everyday kind of thing: mood, being in a mood.
Prior to all psychology of moods, a field which, moreover, still lies fallow,
we must see this phenomenon as a fundamental existential and outline
its structure.
Both the undisturbed equanimity and the inhibited discontent of
everyday heedfulness, the way we slide over from one to another or slip
into bad moods, are by no means nothing ontologically although these
phenomena remain unnoticed as what is supposedly the mos t indiffer­
ent and fleeting in Da-sein. The fac t that moods can be spoiled and
change only means that Da-sein is always already in a mood. The often
persistent, smooth, and pallid lack of mood, which must not be con­
fused with a bad mood, is far from being nothing. Rather, in this Da-sein

I.v

Being and Time

127

becomes tired of itself. Being has become manifest as a burden [Last] .*
One does n o t know why. And Da-sein cannot know why because the
possibilities of disclosure belonging to cognition fall far short of the
primordial disclosure of moods in which Da-sein is brought before its
being as the there. Furthermore, an elevated mood can alleviate the
manifest burden of being. This possibility of mood, too, discloses the
burdensome character of Da-sein even when it alleviates that burden.
Mood makes manifest "how one is and is coming along. " In this "how
one is" being in a mood brings being to its "there."
In being in a mood, Da-sein is always already disclosed in accordance with its mood as that being to which Da-sein was delivered over in
its being as the being which it, existing, has to be. Disclosed does not, as
such, mean to be known. Just in the most indifferent and harmless every­
dayness the being of Da-se�n can burst forth as the naked "that it is and
has to be." The pure "that it is" shows itself, the whence and whither
remain obscure. The fact that Da-sein normally does not "give in" to
such everyday moods, that is, does not pursue what they disclose and
does not allow itself to confront what has been disclosed, is no evidence
against the phenomenal fact of the moodlike disclosure of the being of
the there in its that, but is rather evidence for it. For the most part Dasein evades the being that is disclosed in moods ip. an ontic and existentiell
way. Ontologically and existentially this means that in that to which such a
mood pays no attention Da-sein is unveiled in its being delivered over to
the there. In the evasion itself the there is something disclosed.
We shall call this character of being of Da-sein which is veiled in its
whence and whither, but in itself all the more openly disclosed, this
"that it is, " the thrownness of this being into its there; it is thrown in
such a way that it is the there as being-in-the-world. The expression
thrownness is meant to suggest the facticity of its being delivered over. The
"that it is and has to be" disclosed in the attunement of Da-sein is not the
" that" which expresses ontologically and categorially the factuality
belonging to objective presence; The latter is accessible only when we
ascertain it by looking at it. Rather, the that disclosed in attunement
must be understood as an existential attribute of that being which is in
the mode of being-in-the-world. Facticity is not the factuality of the factum
brutum of something objectively present, but is a characteristic of the being of
Da-sein taken on in existence, although initially thrust aside. The that of fac­
ticity is never to be found by looking.
Beings of the character of Da-sein are their there in such a way
that they find themselves in their thrownness, whether explicitly or not.

1 28

I.v

Being and Time

In attunement, Da-sein is always already brought before itself, it has
always already found itself, not as perceiving oneself to be there, but as
one fmds one's self in attunement. As a being which is delivered over to
its being, it is also delivered over to the fact that it must always already
have found itself, found itself in a finding which comes not from a direct
seeking, but from a fleeing. Mood does not disclose in the mode of look­
ing at thrownness, but as turning toward and away from it For the most
part, mood does not tum toward the burdensome character of Da-sein
revealed in it, least of all as the all eviation of this burden in an elevated
mood. This turning away is always what it is in the mode of attunement.
Phenomenally,

what mood

discloses and

how it discloses would be

completely misunderstood if what has been dis closed were conflated
with that which attuned Da-sein "at the same time" is acquainted with,

136

knows, and believes. Even when Da-sein is "sure" of its "whither" in
faith or thinks it knows about its whence in rational enlightenment, all of
this makes no difference in the face of the phenomenal fact that moods
bring Da-sein before the that of its there, which stares at it with the
inexorability of an enigma. Existentially and ontologically there is not the
slightest justification for minimizing the " evidence" of attunement by
measuring it against the apodictic certainty of the theoretical cognition
of something merely objectively present. But

the falsification of the phe­

nomena, which banishes them to the sanctuary of the irrational, is no
better. Irrationalism, as the counterpart of rationalism, talks about the
things to which rationalism is blind, but only with a squint.
That a Da-sein factically can, should, and must master its mood
with knowledge and will may signify a priority of willing and cognition in
certain possibilities of existing. But that must not mislead us into onto­
logically denying mood as a primordial kind of being of Da-sein in which
it is disclosed to itself

before

all cognition and willing and

beyond

their

scope of disclosure. Moreover, we never master a mood by being free of
·a mood, but always through a counter mood. The first essential onto­

logical characteristic of attunement is:

Attunement discloses Da-sein in its
thrownness, initially and for the most part in the mode of an evasive turning
away.
From this we can already see that attunement is far removed from
anything like finding a psychical condition. Far from having the charac­
ter of an apprehension which first turns itself around and then turns
back, all immanent reflection can find "experiences" only because the
there is already disclosed in attunement. "Mere mood" discloses the
there more primordially, but it also

closes

it

off more

stubbornly than

any not-perceiving.

Bad moods

show this. In bad moods, Da-sein becomes blind to

itself, the surrounding world of heedfulness is veiled, the circumspection

Being and Time

I.v

1 29

of taking care is led astray. Attunement is so far from being reflected
upon that it precisely assails Da-sein

in the unreflected falling prey to the

"world" of its heedfulness. Mood assails. It comes neither from "without"
nor from "within," but rises from being-in-the-world itself as a mode of
that being. But thus by negatively contrasting attunement with the reflective apprehension of the "inner," we arrive at a positive insight into its

character of disclosure.

attuned is not initially related to something psychical, it is itself not an
inner condition which then in some mysterious way reaches out and
leaves its mark on things and persons . This is the

second

essential char­

acteristic of attunement. It is a fundamental existential mode of being of
the

equiprimordial disclosedness of world,

being-there-with, and existence

because this disclosure itself is essentially being-in-the-world.
Besides these two essential determinations of attunement just
explicated, the disclosure of thrownness and the actual disclosure of
the whole of being-in-the-world, we must notice a

third which

above all

contributes to a more penetrating understanding of the worldliness of
the world. We said earlier• that the world already disclosed lets inner­
worldly things be encountered. This prior disclosedness of the world
which belongs to being-in is also constituted by attunement. Letting
something be encountered is primarily

curcumspective,

not just a sensa­

tion or staring out at something. Letting things be encountered in a
circumspect heedful way has-we can see this now more precisely in
terms of attunement-the character of being affected or moved. But
being affected by the unserviceable, resistant, and threatening character
of things at hand is ontologically possible only because being-in as such
is existentially determined beforehand in such a way that what it encoun­
ters in the world can

matter

to it in this way. This mattering to it is

grounded in attunement, and as attunement it has disclosed the world,
for example, as something by which it can be threatened. Only some­
thing which is the attunement of fearing, or fearlessness, can discover
things at hand in the surrounding world as being threatening. The
moodedness of attunement constitutes existentially the openness to
world of Da-sein.
And only becaus e the "senses" belong ontologically to a being
which has the kind of being attuned to being-in-the-world, can they be
" touched" and "have a sense" for something so that what touches them
shows itself in an affect. Something like an affect would never come
about under the s trongest pressure and resistance, resistance would be
essentially undiscovered, if attuned being-in-the-world were not already
related to having things in the world matter to it in a way prefigured by
moods.

In attunement lies existentially a disclosive submission to world out of

137

130

138

Being and Time

I.v

which things that matter to us can be encountered. Indeed, we must ontologi­
cally in principle leave the primary discovery of the world to "mere
mood." Pure beholding, even if it penetrated into the innermost core of
the being of something objectively present, would never be able to dis­
cover anything like what is threatening.
The fact that everyday circumspection goes wrong on account of
attunement, which is primarily disclosive and is vastly subject to decep­
tion, is, gauged by the idea of an absolute "world"<ognition, a

me on

(not

being). But such ontologically unjustified value judgments completely
fail to recognize the existential positivity of the capacity for being
deceived. When we see the "world" in an unsteady and wavering way in
accordance with our moods, what is at hand shows itself in its specific
worldliness, which is never the same on any given day. Theoretical look·
ing at the world has always already flattened it down to the uniformity of
what is purely objectively present, although, of course, a new abundance
of what can be discovered in pure determination lies within that uni­
formity. But the purest theiiria does not abandon all moods, either. Even
when we look theoretically at what is merely objectively present, it does
not show itself in its pure outward appearance unless this theiiria lets it
come toward us in a tranquil staying .

.

.

in rhast01u! and diagage.5 We must

not confuse demonstrating the existential-ontological constitution of
cognitive determination in the attunement of being-in-the-world with
the attempt to surrender science ontically to "feeling."
The various modes of attunement and their interconnected foun­
dations cannot be interpreted within the problematic of this investiga­
tion. As phenomena they have long been familiar ontically under the
terms of affects and feelings and have always been considered in phi­
losophy. It is not a matter of chance that the first traditional and sys·
tematically developed interpretation of the affects is not treated in the
scope of "psychology." Aristotle investigated the pathe in the second
book of his Rhetoric. Contrary to the traditional orientation of the con­
cept of rhetoric according to which it is some kind of "discipline," Aris­
totle's Rhetoric must be understood as the first systematic hermeneutic of
the everydayness of being-with-one-another. Publicness as the kind of
being of the they (cf. section
139

27) not only has its attunedness, it uses

mood and "makes" it for itself. The speaker speaks to it and from it. He
needs the understanding of the possibility of mood in order to arouse
and direct it in the right way.
The continuation of the interpretation of the affects in the Stoics
as well as their tradition in patristic and scholastic theology down to
modern times are well known. What has not been noted is the fact that
the fundamental ontological interpretation of the affects has hardly
been able to take one step worthy of mention since Aristotle. On the

Being and Time

I.v

131

contrary, the affects and feelings fall thematically under the psychic
phenomena, functioning as a third class of these, mostly along with rep­
resentational thinking and willing. They sink to the level of accompany­
ing phenomena.
It is the merit of phenomenological investigation that it has again
created the freer view of these phenomena. Not only that: Scheler,
adopting the suggestions of Augustine and Pascal,6 steered the prob­
lematic toward the foundational context between "representing" and
"interested" acts. Of course, here too, the existential-ontological foun­
dations of the phenomenon of act generally remain in the dark.
Attunement discloses Da-sein not only in its thrownness and
dependence on the world already disclosed with its being, it is itself the
existential kind of being in which it is continually surrendered to the
"world" and lets itself be concerned by it in such a way that it somehow
evades its very self. The existential constitution of this evasion becomes
clear in the phenomenon of entanglement.
Attunement is an existential, fundamental way in which Da-sein is
its there. It not only characterizes Da-sein ontologically, but is at the
same time of fundamental methodical significance for the existential
analytic because of its disclosure. like every ontological interpretation in
general, the analytic can only listen in, so to speak, on beings already
previously disclosed with regard to their being. And it will keep to the
eminent disclosive possibilities ofDa-sein of the widest scope in order to
gain from them information about this being. The phenomenological
interpretation must give toDa-sein itself the possibility of primordial dis­
closure and let it, so to speak, interpret itself. It goes along with this dis­
closure only in order to raise the phenomenal content of disclosure
existentially to a conceptual level.
With regard to the later interpretation of such an existential-onto­
logically significant basic attunement ofDa-sein, Angst (cf. section

40),

the phenomenon of attunement will be demonstrated more concretely
in the definite mode of fear.
30.

Fear as a Mode of Attunement'

The phenomenon of fear can be considered in three aspects. We shall
analyze what we are afraid of, fearing, and why we are afraid. These
possible aspects of fear are not accidental; they belong together. With
them, the structure of attunement as such comes to the fore. We shall
complete our analysis by alluding to the possible modifications of fear
each of which concerns its various structural factors.
That

before which we are afraid, the "fearsome," is always some­

thing encountered within the world, either with the kind of being of

140

132

Being and Time

l.v

something at hand or something objectively present or Mitda-sein. We do
not intend to report ontically about beings which often and for the
most part can be "fearsome," but to determine phenomenally what is
fearsome in its fearsome character. What is it that belongs to the fear­
some as such which is encountered in fearing? What is feared has the
character of being threatening. Here several points must be considered.

1. What is encountered has the relevant nature of harmfulness. It shows
itself in a context of relevance.

2. Thus harmfulness aims at a definite range of what can be affected by
it. So determined, it comes from a definite region.

3. The region itself and what comes from it is known as something
which is "uncanny."
4. As something threatening, what is harmful is not yet near enough to

be dealt with, but it is coming near. As it approaches, harmfulness
radiates and thus has the character of threatening.

5. This approaching occurs within nearness. Something may be harmful
in the highest degree and may even be constantly coming nearer but
if it is still far off it remains veiled in its fearsome nature. As some­
thing approaching in nearness, however, what is harmful is threaten-

141

ing, it can get us, and yet perhaps not. In approaching, this "it can
and yet in the end it may not" gets worse. It is fearsome, we say.

6. This means that what is harmful, approaching near, bears the revealed
possibility of not happening and passing us by. This does not lessen
or extinguish fearing, but enhances it.

Fearing itself frees what

we have characterized as threatening in a

way which lets us be concerned with it. It is not that we initially ascertain
a future evil

( ma lum futurum) and then are afraid of it. But neither does

fearing first confirm something approaching us, but rather discovers it
beforehand in its fearsomeness. And then fear, in being afraid, can
"clarify" what is fearsome by explicitly looking at it. Circumspection
sees what is fearsome because it is in the attunement of fear. As a dor­
mant possibility of attuned being-in-the-world, fearing, "fearfulness" has
already disclosed the world with regard to the fact that something like a
fearful thing can draw near to us from this fearfulness. The ability to
draw near is itself freed by the essential, existential spatiality of being-in­
the-world.
The about which fear is afraid is the fearful being itself, Da-sein.
Only a being which is concerned in its being about that being can be
afraid. Fearing discloses this being in its jeopardization, in its being left
to itself. Although in varying degrees of explicitness, fear always reveals
Da-sein in the being of its there. When we are afraid for house and

Being and Time

I.V

133

home, this is not a counter-example for the above determination of
what it is we are fearful about. For as being-in-the-world, Da-sein is
always a heedful being-with. Initially and for the most part, Da-sein is in
terms of what it takes care of. The jeopardization of that is a threat to
being with. Fear predominantly discloses Da-sein in a privative way. It
bewilders us and makes us "lose our heads." At the same time, fear
closes off our jeopardized being in by letting us see it so that when fear
has subsided Da-sein has to first find its way about again.
Fear about as being afraid of always equiprimordially discloses,
whether privatively or positively, innerworldly beings in their possibility
of being threatening and being-in with regard to its being threatened.
Fear is a mode of attunement.
But fearing about can also involve others, and we then speak of
fearing for them.This fearing for ...does not take away the other's fear
from him. That is out of the question because the other for whom we are
afraid does not even have to be afraid on his part. We are afraid for the
other most of all precisely when he is not afraid and blunders recklessly
into what is threatening.Fearing for ...is a mode of co-attunement with
others, but it is not necessarily being afraid with them or even being
afraid together. One can be afraid for ...without being afraid oneself.
But viewed precisely, fearing for . . . is, after all, being afraid oneself.
What is "feared" here is the being-with the other who could be snatched
away from us.What is fearsome is not aimed directly at the one who is
fearing with.Fearing for ...knows in a way that it is unaffected and yet
is affected in the involvement of Mitda-sein for whom it is afraid. Thus
fearing for is not

a

weaker form of being afraid.It is not a matter here of

degrees of "feeling tones," but of existential modes. Fearing for . ..
does not lose its specific genuineness when it is "really" not afraid.
The factors constitutive for the full phenomenon of fear can vary.
Thus various possibilities of fear result. Approaching nearby belongs
to the structure of encountering what is threatening. When something
threatening itself suddenly bursts into heedful being-in-the-world in its
character of "not right now, but at any moment," fear becomes alarm.
We must distinguish in what is threatening: the nearest approach of
what threatens and the way of encountering this approach itself, sud­
denness. What we are alarmed about is initially something known and
familiar. But when what threatens has the character of something com­
pletely unfamiliar, fear becomes h orror. And when something threaten­
ing is encountered in the aspect of the horrible, and at the same time is
encountered as something alarming, suddenness, fear becomes terror.
We are familiar with further variations of fear, such as timidity, shy­
ness, anxiety, misgiving. All modifications of fear as possibilities of
attunement point to the fact that Da-sein

as

being-in-the-world is "fear-

ful." This "fearfulness" must not be understood in the ontic sense of a
factical, "isolated" tendency, but rather as the existential possibility of the
essential attunement of Da-sein in general, which is, of course, not the
only one.

31. Da-sein

Understanding
of the existential structures in which the being of the

"there" dwells. Equiprimordially with it, understanding constitutes this
being. Attunement always has its understanding, even if only by sup-

143

pressing it. Understanding is always attuned. If we interpret under­
standing as a fundamental existential,* we see that this phenomenon is
conceived as a fundamental mode of the being of Da-sein. In contrast,
"understanding" in the sense of one possible kind of cognition among
others, let us say distinguished from "explanation," must be interpreted
along with that as an existential derivative of the primary understanding
which constitutes the being of the there in general.
Our previous inquiry already encountered this primordial under­
standing, but without explicitly taking it up in the theme under consid­
eration. The statement that Da-sein, existing, is its there means: World is
"there"; its Da-sein is being-in. Being-in is "there" as that for the sake of
which Da-sein is. Existing being-in-the-world as such is disclosed in the
for-the-sake-of-which, and we called this disclosedness understanding.8 In
understanding the for-the-sake-of-which, the significance grounded
therein is also disclosed. The disclosure of understanding, as that of
the for-the-sake-of-which and of significance, is equiprimordially con­
cerned with complete being-in-the-world. Significance is that for which
world as such is disclosed. The statement that the for-the-sake-of-which
and significance are disclosed in Da-sein means that Da-sein is a being
which, as being-in-the-world, is concerned about itself.
Speaking ontically, we sometimes use the expression "to under­
stand something" to mean "being able to handle a thing," "being up to
it," "being able to do something." In understanding as an existential, the
thing we are able to do is not a what, but being as existing. The mode of
being of Da-sein as a potentiality of being lies existentially in under­
standing. Da-sein is not something objectively present which then has as
an addition the ability to do something, but is rather primarily being-pos­
sible. Da-sein is always what it can be and how it is its possibility. The
essential possibility of Da-sein concerns the ways of taking care of the
"world" which we characterized, of concern for others and, always already
present in all of this, the potentiality of being itself, for its own sake.

The being-possible, which Da-sein always is existentially, is also distin­
guished from empty, logical possibility and from the contingency of
something objectively present, where this or that can "happen" to it. As a
modal category of objective presence, possibility means what is not yet real
and not always necessary. It characterizes what is only possible. Ontologi­
cally, it is less than reality and necessity. In contrast, possibility as an
existential is the most primordial and the ultimate positive ontological
determination of Da-sein; as is the case with existentiality, it can initially
be prepared for solely as a problem. Understanding as a potentiality of
being disclosive offers the phenomenal ground to see it at all.
As an existential, possibility does not refer to a free-floating poten­
tiality of being in the sense of the "liberty of indifference" ( libertas indif

ferentiae). As essentially attuned, Da-sein has always already got itself
into definite possibilities. As a potentiality for being which it is, it has let
some go by; it constantly adopts the possibilities of its being, grasps
them, and goes astray. But this means that Da-sein is a being-possible
entrusted to itself, thrown possibility throughout. Da-sein is the possibility
of being free for its ownmost potentiality of being. Being-possible is
transparent for it in various possible ways and degrees.
Understanding is the being of such a potentiality of being which is
never still outstanding as something not yet objectively present, but as
something essentially never objectively present, is together with the
being of Da-sein in the sense of existence. Da-sein is in the way that it
actually understands or has not understood to be in this or that way. As
this understanding, it "knows" what is going on, that is, what its poten­
tiality of being is. This "knowing" does not first come from an immanent
self-perception, but belongs to the being of the there which is essen­
tially understanding. And only because Da-sein, in understanding is its
there, can it go astray and fail to recognize itself. And since under­
standing is attuned and attunement is existentially surrendered to
thrownness, Da-sein has always already gone astray and failed to recog­
nize itself. In its potentiality of being, it is thus delivered over to the
possibility of first finding itself again in its possibilities.

Understanding is the existential being of the ownmost potentiality of being
of Da-sein in such a way that this being discloses in itself what its very being is
about. The structure of this existential must be grasped more precisely.
As disclosing, understanding always concerns the whole funda­
mental constitution of being-in-the-world. As a potentiality of being,
being-in is always a potentiality of being-in-the-world. Not only is the
world, qua world, disclosed in its possible significance, but innerworldly
beings themselves are freed, these beings are freed for their own possi­
bilities. What is at hand is discovered as such in its serviceabi lity , usab il
ity, detrimentality. The totality of relevance reveals itself as the categorial
­

144

136

Being and Time

whole of a possibility of the connection of things at hand. But the "unity,"
too, of manifold objective presence, nature, is discoverable only on the
basis of the disclosedness of one of its possibilities. Is it a matter of chance
that the question of the

being of nature aims at the "conditions of its pos­
sibility?" On what is this questioning based? It cannot omit the ques­
tion: Why are beings unlikeDa-sein understood in their being if they are

disclosed in terms of the conditions of their possibility? Kant presup­
posed something like this, perhaps correctly so. But this presupposi­
tion itself cannot be left without demonstrating how it is justified.
Why does understanding always penetrate into possibilities accord­
ing to all the essential dimensions of what can be disclosed to it? Because
understanding in itself has the existential structure which we call project.
It projects the being ofDa-sein upon its for-the-sake-of-which just as pri­
mordially as upon significance as the worldliness of its actual world.
The project character of understanding constitutes being-in-the-world
with regard to the disclosedness of its there as the there of a potentiality
of being. Project is the existential constitution of being in the realm of
factical potentiality of being. And, as thrown, Da-sein is thrown into the
mode of being of projecting. Projecting has nothing to do with being
related to a plan thought out, according to which Da-sein arranges its
being, but, as Da-sein, it has always already projected itself and is, as
long as it is, projecting. As long as it is, Da-sein always has understood
itself and will understand itself in terms of possibilities. Furthermore, the
project character of understanding means that understanding does not
thematically grasp that upon which it projects, the possibilities them­
selves. Such a grasp precisely takes its character of possibility away from
what is projected, it degrades it to the level of a given, intended content,
whereas in projecting project throws possibility before itself as possibil­
ity, and as such lets it

be. As projecting, understanding is the mode of

being of Da-sein in which it is its possibilities as possibilities.
Because of the kind of being which is constituted by the existential
of projecting, Da-sein is constantly "more" than it actually is, if one
wanted to and if one could register it as something objectively present in
its content of being. But it is nevermore than it factically is because its
potentiality of being belongs essentially to its facticity. But, as being­
possible, Da-sein is also never less. It is existentially that which it is

not yet

in its potentiality of being. And only because the being of the there gets
its constitution through understanding and its character of project, only
because it is what it becomes or does not become, can it say under­
standingly to itself: "become what you are!"*

*But who are "you"? The one who lets

go-and becomes.

Being and Time

Project always concerns the complete disclosedness of being-inthe-world. As a potentiality of being, understanding itself has possibilities which are prefigured by the scope of what can be essentially disclosed to it. Understanding can turn primarily to the disclosedness of
the world, that is, Da-sein can understand itself initially and for the
most part in terms of the world. Or else understanding throws itself pri­
marily into the for-the-sake-of-which, which means Da-sein exists as
itself.* Understanding is either authentic, originating from its own self
as such, or else inauthentic. The "in" does not mean that Da-sein cuts
itself off from itself and understands "only" the world. World belongs
to its being a self as being-in-the-world. Again, authentic as well as inau­
thentic understanding can be either genuine or not genuine. As a
potentiality of being understanding is altogether permeated with pos­
sibility. Turning to one of these fundamental possibilities of under­
standing, however, does not dispense with the other. Rather, because

understanding always has to do with the complete disclosedness of Da-sein as
being-in-the-world, the involvement of understanding is an existential modification ofproject as a whole_ In understanding the world, being-in is always
also understood. Understanding of existence as such is always an under­
standing of world.

As factical, Da-sein has always already transferred its potentiality of
being into a possibility of understanding.
In its character of project, understanding constitutes existentially
what we call the sight of Da-sein. In accordance with the fundamental
modes of its being which we characterized as the circumspection of tak­
ing care of things, the considerateness of concern, as the sight geared
toward being as such for the sake of which Da-sein is as it is, Da-sein is
equiprimordially the sight existentially existing together with the dis­
closedness of the there. We shall call the sight which is primarily and as
a whole related to existence transparency. We choose this term to desig­
nate correctly understood "self-knowledge" in order to indicate that it is
not a matter here of perceptually finding and gazing at a point which is
the self, but of grasping and understanding the full disclosedness of
being-in-the-world throughout all its essential constitutive factors. Existent
beings glimpse "themselves" only when they have become transparent to
themselves equiprimordially in their being with the world, in being
together with others as the constitutive factors of their existence.
Conversely, the opacity of Da-sein is not solely and primarily
rooted in "egocentric" self-deception, but also in lack of knowledge
about the world.

* But

not qua subject and individual or qua person.

146

138

I.v

Being and Time

We must, of course, guard against a misunderstanding of the

147

expression "sight." It corresponds to the clearedness characterizing the
disclosedness of the there. "Seeing" not only does not mean perceiving
with the bodily eyes, neither does it mean the pure, nonsensory percep­
tion of something objectively present in its objective presence. The only
peculiarity of seeing which we claim for the existential meaning of sight is
the fact that it lets the beings accessible to it be encountered in them­
selves without being concealed. Of course, every "sense" does this within
its genuine realm of discovery. But the tradition of philosophy has been
primarily oriented from the very beginning toward " seeing" as the mode
of access to beings and to being. To preserve the connection, one can
formalize sight and seeing to the point of gaining a universal term which
characterizes every access as access whatsoever to beings and to being.
By showing how all sight is primarily based on understanding­
the circumspection of taking care of things is understanding as common

sense [Vtmtiindigkeit]-we have taken away from pure intuition its priority
which noetically corresponds to the traditional ontological priority of
objective presence. "Intuition" and "thought"* are both already remote
derivatives of understanding. Even the phenomenological "intuition of
essences" is based on existential understanding. We can decide about
this kind of seeing only when we have gained the explicit concepts of
being and the structure of being, which only phenomena in the phe­
nomenological sense can become.
The disclosedness of the there in understanding is itself a mode of
the potentiality-of-being of Da-sein. In the projectedness of its being
upon the for-the-sake-of-which together with that upon significance
(world) lies the disclosedness of being in general.t An understanding of
being is already anticipated in the projecting upon possibilities. Being is
understood! in the project, but not ontologically grasped. Beings which
have the kind of being of the essential project of being-in-the-world have
as the constituent of their being the understanding of being. What we
asserted earlier9 dogmatically is now demonstrated in terms of the con­
stitution of the being in which Da-sein, as understanding, is its there. In
accordance with the limits of this whole inquiry, a satisfactory clarifica­
tion of the existential meaning of this understanding of being can only
be attained on the basis of the temporal interpretation of being.
As existentials, attunement and understanding characterize the

148

primordial disclosedness of being-in-the-world. In the mode of "being
attuned" Da-sein "sees" possibilities in terms of which it is. In the pro*

jective disclosure of such possibilities, it is always already attuned. The
project of its ownmost potentiality of being is delivered over to the fact
of thrownness into the there. With the explication of the existential
constitution of the being of the there in the sense of thrown project
does not the being of Da-sein become still more mysterious? Indeed. We
must first let the full mysteriousness of this being emerge, if only to be
able to get stranded in a genuine way in its "solution" and to raise the
question anew of the being of thrown-projecting being-in-the-world.
In order to sufficiently bring even only the everyday mode of being
of attuned understanding phenomenally to view, a concrete develop­
ment of these existentials is necessary.

32. Understanding and Interpretation
As understanding, Da-sein projects its being upon possibilities. This being
toward possibilities that understands is itself a potentiality for being because
of the way these disclosed possibilities come back to Da-sein. The project
of understanding has its own possibility of development. We shall call the
development of understanding interpretation. In interpretation under­
standing appropriates what it has understood in an understanding way.
In interpretation understanding does not become something different,
but rather itself. Interpretation is existentially based in understanding,
and not the other way around. Interpretation is not the acknowledg­
ment of what has been understood, but rather the development of pos­
sibilities projected in understanding. In accordance with the train of
these preparatory analyses of everyday Da-sein, we shall pursue the phe­
nomenon of interpretation in the understanding of the world, that is, in
inauthentic understanding in the mode of its genuineness.
In terms of the significance of what is disclosed in understanding the

world, the being of taking care of what is at hand learns to understand
what the relevance can be with what is actually encountered. Circum­
spection discovers, that is, the world which has already been understood is
interpreted. What is at hand comes explicitly before sight that understands.

All preparing,

arranging,

setting right, improving, rounding out, occur in

such a way that things at hand for circumspection are interpreted in their
in-order-to and are taken care of according to the interpretedness which
has become visible. What has been circumspectly interpreted with regard
to its in-order-to as such, what has been explicitly understood, has the
structure of something as something. The circumspectly interpretive answer
to the circwnspect question of what this particular thing at hand is

runs:

it

is for . . . . Saying what it is for is not simply naming something, but what
is named is understood

as

as

which what is in question is to be taken.

What is disclosed in understanding, what is understood is always already
accessible in such a way that in it its "as what" can be explicitly delin-

149

140

Being and Time

l.v

eated. The "as" constitutes the structure of the explicitness of what is
understood; it constitutes the interpretation. The circumspect, interpretive
association with what is at hand in the surrounding world which "sees" this
as

a table, a door, a

car,

a bridge does not necessarily already have to ana­

lyze what is circwnspectly interpreted in a particular statement. Any simple
prepredicative seeing of what is at hand is in itself already understanding
and interpretative. But does not the lack of this "as" constitute the sim­
plicity of a pure perception of something? The seeing of this sight is
always already understanding and interpreting. It contains the explicit­
ness of referential relation (of the in-order-to) which belong to the totality
of relevance in terms of which what is simply encountered is understood.
The articulation of what is understood in the interpreting approach to
beings guided by the "something as something" lies before a thematic state­
ment about it. The "as" does not first show up in the statement, but is only
first stated, which is possible only because it is there as something to be
stated. The fact that the explicitness of a statement can be lacking in sim­
ple looking, does not justify us in denying every articulate interpretation,
and thus the as-structure, to this simple seeing. The simple seeing of
things nearest to us in our having to do with ... contains the structure of
interpretation so primordially that a grasping of something which is, so to
speak, free

of the as requires a kind of reorientation. When we just stare at
as a failure to u'ntkr­
stand it any more. This grasping which is free of the as is a privation of sim­
ple seeing, which understands; it is not more primordial than the latter, but
something, our just-having-it-before-us lies before us

derived from it. The ontic inexplicitness of the "as" must not mislead us
into overlooking it as the

a primi existential constitution of understanding.

But if any perception of useful things at hand always understands
150

and interprets them, letting them be circumspectly encountered as
something, does this not then mean that initially something merely
objectively present is experienced which then is understood

as

a door,

as

a house? That would be a misunderstanding of the specific disclosive
function of interpretation. Interpretation does not, so to speak, throw a
"significance" over what is nakedly objectively present and does not
stick a value on it, but what is encountered in the world is always already
in a relevance which is disclosed in the understanding of world, a rele­
vance which is made explicit by interpretation.
Things at hand are always already understood in terms of a totality
of relevance. This totality need not be explicitly grasped by a thematic
interpretation. Even if it has undergone such an interpretation, it recedes
again into an undifferentiated understanding. This is the very mode in
which it is the essential foundation of everyday, circumspect interpreta­
tion. This is always based on a

fore-having. As

the appropriation of under­

standing in being that understands, the interpretation operates in being
toward a totality of relevance which has already been understood. When

J.v

Being and Tim.

141

something is understood but still veiled, it becomes unveiled by an act of
appropriation and this is always done under the guidance of a perspective
which fixes that with regard to which what has been understood is to be
i nter preted. The interpretation is grounded in a foresight that
"approaches" what has been taken in fore-having with a definite inter­
pretation in view. What is held in the fore-having and understood in a
"fore-seeing" view becomes comprehensible through the interpretation.
The interpretation can draw the conceptuality belonging to the beings to
be interpreted from these themselves or else force them into concepts to
which beings are opposed in accordance with their kind of being. The
interpretation has always already decided, finally or provisionally, upon a
definite conceptuality; it is grounded in afore-conception.
The interpretation of something as something is essentially
grounded in fore-having, fore-sight, and fore-conception. Interpreta­
tion is never a presuppositionless grasping of something previously
given. When the particular concretion of the interpretation in the sense
of exact text interpretation likes to appeal to what "is there," what is ini­
tially "there" is nothing else than the self-evident, undisputed prejudice
of the interpreter, which is necessarily there in each point of departure
of the interpretation as what is already "posited" with interpretation as
such, that is, pre-given with fore-having, fore-sight, fore-conception.
How are we to conceive the character of this "fore"? Have we done
this when we formally say "a priori"? Why is this structure appropriate to
understanding which we have characterized as a fundamental existential
of Da-sein? How is the structure of the "as" which belongs to what is
interpreted as such related to the fore-structure? This phenomenon is
obviously not to be dissolved "into pieces." But is a primordial analytic to
be ruled out? Should we accept such phenomena as "finalities"? Then
the question would remain, why? Or do the fore-structure of under­
standing and the as-structure of interpretation show an existential-onto­
logical connection with the phenomenon of project? And does this phe­
nomenon refer back to a primordial constitution of being of Da-sein?
Before answering these questions for which the preparation up to
this point is not at all sufficient, we must inquire whether what is visible as
the fore-structure of understanding and qua the as-structure of interpre­
tation does not itself already represent a unitary phenomenon which is
used copiously in philosophical problematics, though what is used so
universally falls short of the primordiality of ontological explication.
In the projecting of understanding, beings are disclosed in their
possibility. The character of possibility always corresponds to the kind of
being of the beings understood. Innerworldly beings in general are pro­
jected toward the world, that is, toward a totality of significance in whose
referential relations taking care, as being-in-the-world, has rooted itself
from the beginning. When with the being of Da-sein innerworldly beings

151

Being and Time

142

I.v

are discovered, that is, have come to be understood, we say that they
have

meaning.

But strictly speaking, what is understood is not the mean­

ing, but beings, or being. Meaning is that wherein the intelligibility of
something maintains itself. What can be articulated in disclosure that
understands we call meaning. The

concept of meaning includes

the formal

framework of what necessarily belongs to what interpretation that under­
stands articulates.

Meaning, structured by fore-having, fore-sight, and fore­
conception, is the upon which of the project in terms of which something becomes
intelligible as something. Since understanding and interpretation constitute

the existential constitution of the being of the there, meaning must be
understood as the formal, existential framework of the disclosedness
belonging to understanding. Meaning is an existential of Da-sein, not a
property which is attached to beings, which lies "behind" them or floats
somewhere as a "realm between." Only Da-sein "has" meaning in that
the disclosedness of being-in-the-world can be "fulfilled" through the
beings discoverable in it.

less.

Thus only Da-sein can be meaningful or meaning­

This means that its own being and the beings disclosed with that

being can be appropriated in understanding or they can be confmed to
incomprehensibility.

152

If we adhere to this interpretation of the concept of "meaning,"
that is in principle ontological-existential, all beings whose mode of
being is unlike Da-sein must be understood as

unmeaningful,

as essen­

tially bare of meaning as such. "Unmeaningful" does not mean here a
value judgment, but expresses an ontological determination.

what is unmeaningful can be absurd.

And only

Objectively present things encoun­

tered in Da-sein can, so to speak, run against its being, for example,
events of nature which break in on us and destroy us.
And when we ask about the meaning of being, our inquiry does
not become profound and does not brood on anything which stands
behind being, but questions being itself in so far as it stands within the
intelligibility of Da-sein. The meaning of being can never be contrasted
with beings or with being as the supporting "ground" of beings because
"ground" is only accessible as meaning, even if that meaning itself is an
abyss of meaninglessness.
As the disclosedness of the there, understanding always concerns
the whole of being-in-the-world. In every understanding of world, exis­
tence is also understood, and vice versa. Furthermore, every interpreta­
tion operates within the fore-structure which we characterized. Every
interpretation which is to contribute some understanding must already
have understood what is to be interpreted. This fact has always already
been noticed, if only in the realm of derivative ways of understanding
and interpretation, in philological interpretation. The latter belongs to
the scope of scientific cognition. Such cognition demands the rigor of

Being and Time

143

demonstration giving reasons. Scientific proof must not already pre­
suppose what its task is to found. But if interpretation always already has
to operate within what is understood and nurture itself from this, how
should it then produce scientific results without going in a circle, espe­
cially when the presupposed understanding still operates in the common
knowledge of human being and world? But according to the most ele­
mentary rules of logic, the

circle is a circulus vitios'lis. But the business of
apriori from the realm of exact

historical interpretation is thus banned

knowledge. If the fact of the circle in understanding is not removed, his­
toriography must be content with less strict possibilities of knowledge. It
is permitted more or less to replace this lack with the "spiritual signifi­
cance" of its "objects." It would be more ideal, of course, moreover
according to the opinion of the historiographers themselves, if the circle
could be avoided and if there were the hope for once of creating a his­
toriography which is· as independent of the standpoint of the observer as
the knowledge of nature is supposed to be.

But to see a vitiosum in this circle and to look for ways to avoid i� even to
"feel" that is an inevitable impeifection, is to misunderstand understanding
from the ground up. It is not a matter of assimilating understanding and
interpretation to a particular ideal of knowledge which is itself only a
degeneration of understanding which has strayed into the legitimate
grasping what is objectively present in its essential unintelligibility. The
fulfillment of the fundamental conditions of possible interpretation
rather lies in not mistaking interpretation beforehand with regard to the
essential conditions of its being done. What is decisive is not to get out of
the circle, but to get in it in the right way. This circle of understanding is
not a circle in which any random kind of knowledge operates, but it is
rather the expression of the existentialfore-structure of Da-sein itself. The
circle must not be degraded to a

vitiosum, not even to a tolerated one. A

positive possibility of the most primordial knowledge is hidden in it
which, however, is only grasped in a genuine way when interpretation has
understood that its first, constant, and last task is not to let fore-having,
fore-sight, and fore-conception be given to it by chance ideas and popu­
lar conceptions, but to guarantee the scientific theme by developing
these in terms of the things themselves. Because in accordance with its
existential meaning, understanding is the potentiality for being of Da-sein
itself, the ontological presuppositions of historiographical knowledge
transcend in principle the idea of rigor of the most exact sciences. Math­
ematics is not more exact than historiographical, but only narrower with
regard to the scope of the existential foundations relevant to it.
The "circle" in understanding belongs to the structure of meaning,
and this phenomenon is rooted in the existential constitution of Da­
sein, in interpretive understanding. Beings which, as being-in-the-world,

153

144

Being and Time

I.v

are concerned about their being itself* have an ontological structure
of the circle. However, if we note that the "circle" belongs ontologically
to a kind of being of objective presence (subsistence), we shall in general
have to avoid characterizing something like Da-sein ontologically with
this phenomenon.
33. Statement as a Derivative Mode of Interpretation
All interpretation is grounded in understanding. What is articulated as
154

such in interpretation and is prefigured as articulable in understanding in general is meaning. Since the statement (the "judgment") is based
on understanding and represents a derivative form of interpretation, it
also "has" a meaning. Meaning, however, cannot be defined as what
occurs "in" a judgment along with the act of judgment. The explicit
analysis of the statement has several goals in our context.
On the one hand, we can demonstrate in the statement in what
way the structure of the "as," which is constitutive for understanding and
interpretation, can be modified. Understanding and interpretation thus
come into sharper focus. Then, the analysis of the statement has a dis­
tinctive place in the fundamental-ontological problematic because in
the decisive beginnings of ancient ontology the logos functioned as the
sole guide for the access to true beings and for the determination of the
being of beings. Finally, the statement has been regarded from ancient
times as the primary and true "locus" of truth. This phenomenon is so
intimately connected with the problem of being that our inquiry neces­
sarily runs into the problem of truth as it proceeds; it already lies within
the dimension of that problem, although not explicitly. The analysis of
the statement is to make way for this problematic.
In what follows we shall assign to the term statement three signifi­
cations which are drawn from the phenomenon thus characterized.
They are interconnected and delineate in their unity the full structure of
the statement
I. Primarily, statement means pointing out. With this we adhere to
the primordial meaning of logos as apophansis: to let beings be seen from
themselves. In the statement "the hammer is too heavy," what is discov­
ered for sight is not a "meaning," but a being in the mode of its being at
hand. Even when this being is not near enough to be grasped and
"seen," pointing out designates the being itself, not a mere representa-

But this "its being itself" is intrinsically determined by the understanding of

being, that is, by standing within the dearing of presence, where neither the

tion of it, neither something "merely represented" nor even a psychical
condition of the speaker, his representing of this being.
2. Statement is tantamount to predication. A "predicate" is "stated"
about a "subject," the latter is determined by the fanner. What is stated in
this signification of statement is not the predicate, but the "h ammer
itself." What does the stating, that is, the determining, on the other hand,
lies in the "too heavy." What is stated in the second signification of statement, what is determined as such, has been narrowed down in its content
as opposed to what is stated in the first signification of this tenn. Every
predication is what it is only as a pointing out. The second signification of
statement has its foundation in the first. The elements which are articulated in predication, subject-predicate, originate within the pointing out.
Determining does not first discover, but as a mode of pointing out initially limits seeing precisely to what shows itself-hammer-as such, in
order to manifest explicitly what is manifest in its determinacy through,
the explicit limitation of looking. When confronted with what is already
manifest, with the hammer which is too heavy, determining must first
take a step back. "Positing the subject" dims beings down to focus on "the
hammer there" in order to let what is manifest be seen in its deter­
minable definite character through this dimming down. Positing the subject, positing the predicate, and positing them together are thoroughly
"apophantic" in the strict sense of the word.
3. Statement means communication, speaking forth. As such it has a
direct relation to statement in the first and second meanings. It is letting
someone see with us what has been pointed out in its definite character.
Letting someone see with us shares with the others the beings pointed
out in their defmiteness. What is "shared" is the being toward what is
pointed out which has a way of seeing common to all. We must keep in
mind that this being-toward is being-in-the-world, namely, in the world
from which what is pointed out is encountered. Any statement, as a
communication understood existentially, must have been expressed. As
something communicated, what is spoken can be "shared" by the others
with the speaker even when they themselves do not have the beings
pointed out and defmed in a palpable and visible range. What is spoken
can be "passed along" in further retelling. The scope of communica­
tion which sees is broadened. But at the same time what is pointed out
can become veiled again in this further retelling, although the knowl­
edge and cognition growing in such hearsay always means beings them­
selves and does not "affinn" a "valid meaning" passed around. Even
hearsay is a being-in-the-world and a being toward what is heard.
The theory of "judgment" prevalent today that is oriented toward
the phenomenon of "validity" shall not be discussed at any length here.
It is sufficient to refer to the very questionable character of this phe-

155

146

nomenon of "validity" which, ever since Lotze, people have been fond of
passing off as a "primal phenomenon" not to be traced further back. It
owes this role only to its ontological lack of clarity. The "problematic"
156

which has entrenched itself around this idolatry of the word is just as
opaque. On the one hand, validity means the

"form" of the reality

which

belongs to the content of the judgment since it has an unchangeable
existence as opposed to the changeable "psychic" act of judgment. In the
light of the position of the question of being in general characterized in
the introduction to this inquiry, we can hardly expect that "validity" as
"ideal being" is going to be distinguished by any special ontological clar­
ity. Then, at the same time, validity means the validity of the meaning of
the judgment which is valid for the "object" it has in view and thus

"objective validity" and objectivity in general.

itself, is said to be "valid" also in the sense of being valid for every person

"universal valid­

ity." If one then advocates a "critical" epistemological theory, according
to which the subject does not "truly" "come out" to the object, then
this valid character, as the validity of an object, objectivity, is based on
the valid content of true(!) meaning. The three meanings of "validity"
set forth, the way of being of the ideal, as objectivity and as bindingness,
are not only in themselves opaque, but constantly get confused with
one another. Methodological caution requires we do not choose such
unstable concepts as the guide for our interpretation. We make no
advance restriction on the concept of meaning which would confine it to
a signification of a "content of judgment," but we understand it as the
existential phenomenon characterized in which the formal framework of
what can be disclosed in understanding and articulated in interpretation
becomes visible as such.
When we collect the three meanings of "statement" analyzed here
in a unitary view of the complete phenomenon, the definition reads:

Statement is a pointing out which communicates and defines.

Now we must

ask: what right do we have at all to conceive the statement as a mode of
interpretation? If it is something of this sort, the essential structures of
interpretation must be repeated in it. The statement's pointing out is
accomplished on the basis of what is already disclosed in understanding,
or what is circumspectly discovered. The statement is not an unattached
kind of behavior which could of itself primarily disclose beings in gen­
eral, but always already maintains itself on the basis of being-in-the­
world. When we showed earlier10 with regard to world cognition is just as
157

true of the statement. It needs a fore-having of something disclosed in
general which it points out in the mode of determining. Furthermore,
when one begins to determine something, one has a directed viewpoint

I.v

Being and Time

147

of what is to be stated. The function of determining takes over the direc­
tion in which beings that have been presented are envisaged in the act of
determining. The statement needs a fore-sight in which the predicate
which is to be delineated and attributed is itself loosened, so to speak, in
its inexplicit enclosure in beings themselves. A significant articulation of
what is pointed out always belongs to the statement as communication
that defmes, it operates within a defmite set of concepts. The hammer is
heavy, heaviness belongs to the hammer, the hammer has the property
of heaviness. The fore-conception always also contained in the state­
ment remains mostly inconspicuous because language always already
contains a developed set of concepts. Like interpretation in general,
the statement necessarily has its existential foundations in fore-having,
fore-sight, and fore-conception.
But how does the statement become a

derivative mode

of inter­

pretation? What has been modified in it? We can point out the modifi­
cation by sticking with limiting cases of statements which function in
logic as normal cases and examples of the most "simple" phenomena of
statement. What logic makes thematic with the categorical statement, for
example, "the hammer is heavy," it has always already understood "log­
ically" before any analysis. As the "meaning" of the sentence, it has
already presupposed without noticing it the following: this thing, the
hammer, has the property of heaviness. "Initially" there are no such
statements in heedful circumspection. But it does have its specific ways
of interpretation which can read as follows as compared with the "the­
oretical judgment" just mentioned and may take some such form as
"the hammer is too heavy" or, even better, "too heavy, the other ham­
mer!" The primordial act of interpretation lies not in a theoretical sen­
tence, but in circumspectly and heedfully putting away or changing the
inappropriate tool "without wasting words." From the fact that words are
absent, we may not conclude that the interpretation is absent. On the
other hand, the circumspectly

essarily a statement in the sense defined.

The being held in fore-having, for example the hammer, is initially at hand as a useful thing. If this being is the "object" of a statement,
as soon as we begin the statement, a transformation in the fore-having is
already brought about beforehand . Something

at hand with which

we

have to do or perform something, turns into something "about which"

objectively present in what is at hand. Both by and for the way of looking,
what is at hand is veiled as something at hand. Within this discovering of
objective presence which covers over handiness, what is encountered as
objectively present is detennined in its being objectively present in such
and such a way. Now the access is first available for something like

qual·
ities. That as which the statement detennines what is objectively present
is drawn from what is objectively present as such. The as-structure of
interpretation has undergone a modification. The "as" no longer reaches
out into a totality of relevance in its function of appropriating what is
understood. It is cut off with regard to its possibilities of the articulation
of referential relations of significance which constitute the character of
the surrounding world. The "as" is forced back to the uniform level of
what is merely objectively present. It dwindles to the structure of just let­
ting what is objectively present be seen by way of determination. This
levelling down of the primordial "as" of circumspect interpretation to
the as of the detennination of objective presence is the speciality of the
statement. Only in this way does it gain the possibility of a pointing
something out in a way that we sheerly look at it.
Thus the statement cannot deny its ontological provenance from
an interpretation that understands. We call primordial the "as" of cir­
cumspect interpretation that understands

hermeneutical "as"

in distinction from the

(hermeneia}, the existential­
apophantical "as" of the state­

ment.
There are many interim stages between interpretation which is
quite enveloped in heedful understanding and the extreme opposite
case of a theoretical statement about objectively present things: state­
ments about events in the surrounding world, descriptions of what is at
hand, "reports on situations," noting and ascertaining a "factual situa­
tion," describing a state of affairs, telling about what has happened.
These "sentences" cannot be reduced to theoretical propositional state­
ments without essentially distorting their meaning. Like the latter, they
have their "origin" in circumspect interpretation.
With the progress of knowledge about the structure of the logos, it
was inevitable that this phenomenon of the apophantical "as" carne to
view in some form. The way in which it was initially seen is not a matter
of chance, nor did it fail to have its influence on the history of logic to
come.
159

When considered philosophically, the

logos is itself a being

and, in

accordance with the orientation of ancient ontology, something objec­
tively present. What is initially objectively present, that is, what can be
found like things, are words and the succession of words in which the

logos is

spoken. When we first seek for the structure of the

objectively present, we find an

objective presence together of several words.

Being and Time

I.v

149

What constitutes the unity of this together? As Plato knew, it consists in
the fact that the

logos is always logos tinos. With regard to the beings
logos, the words are combined to form one totality of
words. Aristotle had a more radical view; every logos is synthesis and
diairesis at the same time, not either the one-say, as a "positive judg­
manifest in the

ment"-or the other-as a "negative judgment." Rather, every statement,
whether affirmative or negative, whether false or true, is equiprimor­
dially

synthesis and diairesis. Pointing out is putting together and taking

apart. However, Aristotle did not pursue this analytical question fur­
ther to a problem: what phenomenon is it then within the structure of
the

logos that allows and requires us to characterize every statement as
synthesis and diairesis?
What is to be got at phenomenally with the formal structures of
"binding" and "separating," more precisely, with the unity of the two, is
the phenomenon of "something as something." In accordance with this
structure, something is understood with regard to something else, it is
taken together with it, so that this confrontation that understands, inter­
prets, and articulates, at the same time takes apart what has been put
together. If the phenomenon of the "as" is covered over and above all
veiled in its existential origin from the hermeneutical "as," Aristotle's
phenomenological point of departure disintegrates to the analysis of

logos in an external "theory of judgment," according to which judgment
is a binding or separating of representations and concepts.
Thus binding and separating can be further formalized to mean a
"relating." Logistically, the judgment is dissolved into a system of "co­
ordinations," it becomes the object of "calculation," but not a theme
of ontological interpretation. The possibility and impossibility of the
analytical understanding of

synthesis and diairesis, of "relation" in the

judgment in general, is closely bound up with the actual state of the
fundamental ontological problematic.
To what extent this problematic has an effect on the interpretation
of the

logos and, on the other hand, to what extent the concept of "judg-

ment" has, by a remarkable counter-movement, an effect on the onto­
logical problematic, is shown by the phenomenon of the copula. It
becomes evident in this "bond" that the structure of synthesis is initially
posited as a matter of course and that it has also maintained the decisive
interpretative function. But if the formal characteristics of "relation"
and "binding" cannot contribute anything phenomenally to the factual
structural analysis of the logos, the phenomenon intended with the term
copula finally has nothing to do with bond and binding. Whether
expressed explicitly in language or indicated in the verbal ending, the
"is" and its interpretation are moved into the context of problems of the
existential analytic if statements and an understanding of being are exis-

tential possibilities of being of Da-sein itself. The development of the
question of being (cf. division I, section

3) will then encounter again this

peculiar phenomenon of being within the logos.
For the time being, we wanted to clarify with this demonstration of
the derivation of the statement from interpretation and understanding
the fact that the "logic" of logos is rooted in the existential analytic of Da­
sein. Recognizing the ontologically insufficient interpretation of the

logos at the same time sharpens our insight into the lack of primordiality
of the methodical basis on which ancient ontology developed. The logos
is experienced as something objectively present and interpreted as such,
and the beings which it points out have the meaning "of objective pres­
ence as well. lbis meaning being itself is left undifferentiated and uncon­
trasted with other possibilities of being so that being in the sense of a
formal being-something is at the same time fused with it and we are
unable to obtain a clear-cut division between these two realms.*
34. Da-sein and Discourse: Language

The fundamental existentials which constitute the being of the there, the
disclosedness of being-in-the-world, are attunement and understanding.
Understanding harbors in itself the possibility of interpretation, that is,
the appropriation of what is understood. To the extent that attunement
is equiprimordial with understanding, it maintains itself in a certain
understanding. A certain possibility of interpretation also belongs to it.
An extreme derivative of interpretation was made visible with the state­

ment. The clarification of the third meaning of statement as communi­
cation (speaking forth) led us to the concept of saying and speaking, to
which we purposely paid no attention up to now. The fact that language

only now becomes thematic should indicate that this phenomenon has its
roots in the existential constitution of the disclosedness of Da-sein. The
161

existential-ontological foundation of language is discourse. In our previous
interpretation of attunement, understanding, interpretation, and state­
ment we have constantly made use of this phenomenon, but have, so to
speak, suppressed it in the thematic analysis.

Discourse is existentially equiprimordial with attunemen t and understand­
ing. Intelligibility is also always already articulated before its appropriative
interpretation. Discourse is the articulation of intelligibility. Thus it already
lies at the basis of interpretation and statement. We called what

As what is articulated of what can be articulated,significations are always
bound up with meaning.If discourse,the articulation of the intelligibility
of the there, is the primordial existential of disclosedness and if dis­
closedness is primarily constituted bybeing-in-the-world,discourse must
also essentially have a specificallyworldly mode of being. The attuned
intelligibility of being-in-the-world is expressed as discourse. The totality of sig­
nifications of intelligibility is put into words. Words accrue to significa­
tions.But word-things are not provided with significations.
The way in which discourse gets expressed is language.This total­
ity of words in which discourse has its own "worldly" being can thus be
found as an innerworldly being,like something at hand. Language can
be broken up into word-things objectively present.Discourse is existen­
tial language because the beings whose disclosedness it significantly
articulates have the kind of being of being-in-the-world which is thrown
and reliant upon the "world."*
As the existential constitution of the disclosedness ofDa-sein,dis­
course is constitutive for the existence of Da-sein. Hearing and keeping
silent are possibilities belonging to discoursing speech.The constitutive
function of discourse for the existentialityof existence first becomes
completely clear in these phenomena.First of all,we must develop the
structure of discourse as such.
Discoursing is the "significant " articulation of the intelligibility of
being-in-the-world, to which belongs being-with,and which maintains
itself in a particular way of heedful being-with-one-another.Being-with­
one-another talks in assenting,refusing,inviting,warning,as talking
things through,as getting back to someone,interceding,furthermore as
"making statements" and as talking in "giving a talk." Discourse is dis­
course about ....That which discourse is about does not necessarily
have the character of the theme of a definite statement; in fact,mostlyit
does not have it.Even command is given about something; a wish is
about something.And so is intercession.Discourse necessarily has this
structural factor because it also constitutes the disclosedness of being-in­
the-world and is prestructured in its own structure by this fundamental
constitution of Da-sein.What is talked about in discourse is always
"addressed " in a particular view and within certain limits. In all dis­
course there is what is spoken as such, what is said as such when one
actuallywishes,asks,talks things over about .... In this "something
said," discourse communicates.
As the analysis has already indicated, the phenomenon of commu­
nication must be understood in an ontologically broad sense."Commu-

nication" in which one makes statements, for example, giving informa­
tion, is a special case of the communication that is grasped in principle
existentially. Here the articulation of being-with-one-another under­
standingly is constituted. It brings about the"sharing" of being attuned
together and of the understanding of being-with. Communication is
never anything like a conveying of experiences, for example, opinions
and wishes, from the inside of one subject to the inside of another.

Mitda·sein is essentially already manifest in attunement-with and under­
standing-with. Being-with is "explicitly" shared in discourse, that is, it
already is, only unshared as something not grasped and appropriated.
All discourse about . .. which communicates in what it says has at
the same time the character of expressing itself In talking, Da-sein
expresses itself not because it has been initially cut off as "something
internal" from something outside, but because as being-in-the-world it is
already "outside" when it understands. What is expressed is precisely this
being outside,* that is, the actual mode of attunement (of mood) which
we showed to pertain to the full disclosedness of being-in. Being-in and
its attunement are made known in discourse and indicated in language
by intonation, modulation, in the tempo of talk, "in the way of speak­
ing." The communication of the existential possibilities of attunement,
that is, the disclosing of existence, can become the true aim of"poetic"
speech.
Discourse is the articulation in accordance with significance of the
attuned intelligibility of being-in-the-world. Its constitutive factors are:
what discourse is about (what is discussed}, what is said as such, com­
munication, and making known. These are not properties which can
be just empirically snatched from language, but are existential charac­
teristics rooted in the constitution of being of Da-sein which first make
163

something like language ontologically possible. Some of these factors
can be lacking or remain unnoticed in the factical linguistic form of a
particular discourse. The fact that they often are not"verbally" expressed
is only an indication of a particular kind of discourse which, insofar as it
is discourse, must always lie within the totality of these structures.
Attempts to grasp the "essence of language" have always taken
their orientation toward a single one of these factors and have under­
stood language guided by the idea of"expression,""symbolical forms,"
communication as "statement," "making known" experiences or the
"form" of life. But nothing would be gained for a completely sufficient
definition of language if we were to put these different fragmentary
definitions together in a syncretistic way. What is decisive is to develop

153

the ontological-existential totality of the structure of discourse before­
hand on the basis of the analytic of Da-sein.
The connection of discourse with understanding and intelligibility
becomes clear through an existential possibility which belongs to dis­
course itself, hearing. It is not a matter of chance that we say, when we
have not heard "rightly," that we have not "understood." Hearing is
constitutive for discourse. And just as linguistic utterance is based on dis­
course, acoustic perception is based on hearing. listening to . . . is the
existential being-open of Da-sein as being-with for the other. Hearing
even constitutes the primary and authentic openness of Da-sein for its
ownmost possibility of being, as in hearing the voice of the friend whom
every Da-sein carries with it. Da-sein hears because it understands. As
being-in-the-world that understands, with the others, it "listens to" itself
and to Mitda-sein, and in this listening belongs to these. listening to
each other, in which being-with is developed, has the possible ways of fol­
lowing, going along with, and the privative modes of not hearing, oppo­
sition, defying, turning away.
On the basis of this existentially primary potentiality for hearing,
something like hearkening becomes possible. Hearkening is itself phe­
nomenally more primordial than what the psychologist "initially" defines
as hearing, the sensing of tones and the perception of sounds. Hear­
kening, too, has the mode of being of a hearing that understands. "Ini­
tially" we never hear noises and complexes of sound, but the creaking
wagon, the motorcycle. We hear the column on the march, the north
wind, the woodpecker tapping, the crackling fire.
It requires a very artificial and complicated attitude in order to
"hear" a "pure noise." The fact that we initially hear motorcycles and
wagons is, however, the phenomenal proof that Da-sein, as being-in-theworld, always already maintains itself together with innerworldly things at
hand and initially not at all with "sensations" whose chaos would first
have to be formed to provide the springboard from which the subject
jumps off finally to land in a "world." Essentially understanding, Dasein is initially together with what is understood.
In the explicit hearing of the discourse of the other, too, we ini­
tially understand what is said: more precisely, we are already together
with the other beforehand, with the being which the discourse is about.
We do not, on the contrary, first hear what is expressed in the utterance.
Even when speaking is unclear or the language is foreign, we initially
hear unintelligible words, and not a multiplicity of tone data.
When what the discourse is about is heard "naturally," however, we
can at the same time hear the way in which it is said, the "diction," but
this, too, only by previously understanding what is spoken. Only thus is
there a possibility of estimating whether the way in which it is said is

164

154

Being and Time

l.v

appropriate to what the discourse is about thematically.
Similarly, speaking in turn as an answer initially arises directly
from understanding what the discourse is about, which is already
"shared" in being-with.
Only when the existential possibility of discourse and hearing are
given, can someone hearken. He who "cannot hear" and "must feel"
can perhaps hearken very well precisely for this reason. Just listening
around is a privation of the hearing that understands. Discourse and
hearing are grounded in understanding. Understanding comes neither
from a lot of talking nor from busy listening around. Only he who
already understands is able to listen.
Another essential possibility of discourse has the same existential
foundation, keeping silent. In talking with one another the person who is
silent can "let something be understood," that is, he can develop an
understanding more authentically than the person who never runs out
of words. Speaking a lot about something does not in the least guarantee
that understanding is thus furthered. On the contrary, talking at great
length about something covers things over and gives a false impression
of clarity to what is understood, that is, the unintelligibility of the trivial.
But to keep silent does not mean to be dumb. On the contrary, if a per-

165

son is dumb, he still has the tendency to "speak." Such a person has
not only not proved that he can keep silent, he even lacks the possibility
of proving this. And the person who is by nature accustomed to speak
little is no better able to show that he can be silent and keep silent. He
who never says anything is also unable to keep silent at a given moment.
Authentic silence is possible only in genuine discourse. In order to be
silent, Da-sein must have something to say,* that is, must be in com­
mand of an authentic and rich disclosedness of itself. Then reticence
makes manifest and puts down "idle talk." As a mode of discourse, reti­
cence articulates the intelligibility of Da-sein so primordially that it gives
rise to a genuine potentiality for hearing and to a being-with-one-another
that is transparent.
Since discourse is constitutive for the being of the there, that is,
attunement and understanding, and since Da-sein means being-in-the­
world, Da-sein as discoursing being-in has already expressed itself. Da­
sein has language. Is it a matter of chance that the Greeks, whose every­
day existence lay predominantly in speaking with one another and who
at the same time "had eyes" to see, determined the essence of human
being as zoon logon echont in the pre-philosophical

sophical interpretation of Da-sein? The later interpretation of this defi­
nition of human being in the sense of the animal rationale, "rational liv­
ing being," is not "false," but it covers over the phenomenal basis from
which this definition ofDa-sein is taken. The human being shows himself
as a being who speaks. This does not mean that the possibility of vocal
utterance belongs to him, but that this being is in the mode of discov­
ering world and Da-sein itself. The Greeks do not have a word for lan­
guage, they "initially" understood this phenomenon as discourse. How­
ever, since the logos came into their philosophical view predominantly as
statement, the development of the fundamental structures of the forms
and constituents of discourse was carried out following the guideline of
this logos. Grammar searched for its foundation in the "logic" of this
logos. But this logic is based on the ontology of obj ective presence. The
basic stock of "categories of significance" which were passed over in
subsequent linguistics and are fundamentally still accepted as the crite­
rion today is oriented toward discourse as statement. If, however, we
take this phenomenon in principle to have the fundamental primor­
diality and scope of an existential, the necessity arises of reestablishing
the linguistics on an ontologically more primordial foundation. The
task of freeing grammar from logic requires in advance a positive under­
standing of the a priori fundamental structure of discourse in general as
an existential and cannot be carried out subsequently by improving and
supplementing the tradition. Bearing this in mind, we must inquire into
the basic forms in which it is possible to articulate what is intellible in
general, not only of the innerworldly beings that can be known in theoretical observation and expressed in propositions. A doctrine of significance will not emerge automatically from a comprehensive comparison
of as many languages as possible and those that are most exotic. Nor is
it sufficient to adopt the philosophical horizon within which W. von
Humboldt took language as a problem. The doctrine of significance is
rooted in the ontology of Da-s ein. Whether it prosp ers or decays
depends upon the fate of this ontology. 11
In the end, philosophical research must for once decide to ask
what mode of being belongs to language in general. Is it an innerworldly
useful thing at hand or does it have the mode of being of Da-sein or nei­
ther of the two? What kind of being does language have if there can be
a "dead" language? What does it mean ontologically that a language
grows or declines? We possess a linguistics, and the being of beings
which it has as its theme is obscure; even the horizon for any investiga­
tive question about it is veiled. Is it a matter of chance that initially and
for the most part significations are "worldly," prefigured beforehand
by the significance of the world, that they are indeed often predomi­
nantly "spatial"? Or is this "fact" existentially and ontologically necessary

166

156

and why? Philosophical research will have to give up the "linguistics" if it
is to ask about the "things themselves" and attain the status of a prob­
lematic that has been clarified conceptually.
The foregoing interpretation of language has the sole function of
pointing out the ontological "place" for this phenomenon in the con­
stitution of being of Da-sein and above all of preparing the way for the
following analysis, in which, taking as our guideline a fundamental kind
of being belonging to discourse, in connection with other phenomena,
we shall try to bring the everydayness of Da-sein into view in a way that
is ontologically more primordial.

B. THE EVERYDAY BEING OF THE THERE
AND THE FALLING PREY OF DA-SEIN
In returning to the existential structures of the disclosedness of being-in­
the-world, our interpretation has in a way lost sight of the everydayness

167

of Da-sein. The analysis must again regain this phenomenal horizon
that was our thematic point of departure. Now the question arises: What
are the existential characteristics of the disclosedness of being-in-the­
world, to the extent that the latter, as something everyday, maintains
itself in the mode of being of the they? Is a specific attunement, a special
understanding, discourse, and interpretation appropriate to the they?
The answer to this question becomes all the more urgent when we
remember that Da-sein initially and for the most part is immersed in the
they and mastered by it. Is not Da-sein, as thrown being-in-the-world, ini­
tially thrown into the publicness of the they? And what else does this
publicness mean than the specific disclosedness of the they?
If understanding must be conceived primarily as the potentiality-for­
being of Da-sein, we shall be able to gather from an analysis of the under­
standing and interpretation belonging to the they which possibilities of its
being Da-sein as the they has disclosed and appropriated to itself. These
possibilities themselves, however, reveal an essential tendency of being of
everydayness. And everydayness must finally, when explicated in an onto­
logically sufficient way, unveil a primordial mode of being of Da-sein in
such a way that from it the phenomenon of thrownness which we have
pointed out

can

be exhibited in its existential concreteness.

What is initially required is to make visible the disclosedness of the
they, that is, the everyday mode of being of discourse, sight, and inter­
pretation, in specific phenomena. With regard to these, the remark may
not be superfluous that our interpretation has a purely ontological inten­
tion and is far removed from any moralizing critique of everyday Da-sein
and from the aspirations of a "philosophy of culture."

35. Idle Talk
The expression "idle talk" is not be used here in a disparaging sense.
Terminologically, it means a positive phenomenon which constitutes
the mode of being of the understanding and interpretation of every­
day Da-sein. For the most part, discourse expresses itself and has always
already expressed itself. It is language. But then understanding and
interpretation are always already contained in what is expressed. As
expression, language harbors in itself an interpretedness of the under­
standing of Da-sein. This interpretedness is no more merely obj ectively
present than language is, but rather its being is itself of the character of
Da-sein. Da-sein is initially and in certain limits constantly entrusted to
this interpretedness that directs and apportions the possibilities of the
average understanding and the attunement belonging to it. In the totality of its articulated contexts of signification, expression preserves an
understanding of the disclosed world and thus equiprimordially an
understanding of the Mitda-sein of the others and of one's own being-in.
The understanding already deposited in expression concerns the dis­
coveredness of beings actually reached and handed down, as well as the
actual understanding of being and the possibilities and horizons available to fresh interpretation and conceptual articulation. But above and
beyond a mere reference to the fact of this interpretedness of Da-sein,
we must now ask about the existential mode of being of the discourse
which is expressed and expressing itself. If it cannot be conceived as
something objectively present, what is its being, and what does this
being say in principle about the everyday mode of being of Da-sein?
Discourse expressing itself is communication. Its tendency of being
aims at bringing the hearer to participate in disclosed being toward
what is talked about in discourse.
In the language that is spoken when one expresses oneself, there
already lies an average intelligibility; and in accordance with this intelli­
gibility, the discourse communicated can be understood to a large extent
without the listener coming to a being toward what is talked about in di!r­
course so as to have a primordial understanding of it. One understands
not so much the beings talked about, but one does listen to what is spo­
ken about as such. This is understood, what is talked about is under­
stood, only approximately and superficially. One means
because it is in the

same

the same thing

averageness that we have a common under­

standing of what is said.
Hearing and understanding have attached themselves beforehand
to what is spoken about as such. Communication does not "impart" the
primary relation of being to the being spoken about, but being-with­
one-another takes place in talking with one another and in heeding

168

158

169

Being and Time

T.v

what is spoken about. What is important to it is that one speaks. The
being-said, the dictum, the pronouncement provide a guarantee for the
genuineness and appropriateness of the discourse and the understand­
ing belonging to it. And since this discoursing has lost the primary rela­
tion of being to the being talked about, or else never achieved it, it does
not communicate in the mode of a primordial appropriation of this
being, but communicates by gossiping and passing the word along. What is
spoken about as such spreads in wider circles and takes on a authorita­
tive character. Things are so because one says so. Idle talk is constituted
in this gossiping and passing the word along, a process by which its ini­
tial lack of grounds to stand on increases to complete groundlessness.
And this is not limited to vocal gossip, but spreads to what is written, as
" scribbling." In this latter case, gossiping is based not so much on
hearsay. It feeds on sporadic superficial reading: The average under­
standing of the reader will never be able to decide what has been drawn
from primordial sources with a struggle, and how much is just gossip.
Moreover, the average understanding will not even want such a distinc­
tion, will not have need of it, since, after all, it understands everything.
The groundlessness of idle talk is no obstacle to its being public,
but encourages it. Idle talk is the possibility of understanding every­
thing without any previous appropriation of the matter. Idle talk already
guards against the danger of getting stranded in such an appropriation.
Idle talk, which everyone can snatch up, not only divests us of the task of
genuine understanding, but develops an indifferent intelligibility for
which nothing is closed off any longer.
Discourse, which belongs to the essential constitution of being ofDa­
sein, and also constitutes its disclosedness, has the possibility of becoming
idle talk, and as such of not really keeping being-in-the-world open in an
articulated understanding, but of closing it off and covering over inner­
worldly beings. To do this, one need not aim to deceive. Idle talk does not
have the kind of being of consciously passing off something as something
else. The fact that one has said something groundlessly and then passes it
along is in further retelling sufficient to tum disclosing around into a
closing off. For what is said is initially always understood as "saying," that
is, as discovering. Thus, by its very nature, idle talk is a closing off since it
omits going back to the foundation of what is being talked about.
This closing off is aggravated anew by the fact that idle talk, in
which an understanding of what is being talked about is supposedly
reached, holds any new questioning and discussion at a distance because
it presumes it has understood and in a peculiar way it suppresses them
and holds them back.
This interpretedness of idle talk has always already settled itself
down in Da-sein. We get to know many things initially in this way, and

I.v

Being and Time

159

some things never get beyond such an average understanding. Da-sein
can never escape the everyday way of being interpreted into which Dasein has grown initially. All genuine understanding, interpreting and
communication, rediscovery and new appropriation come about in it
and out of it and against it. It is not the case that a Da-sein, untouched
and unseduced by this way of interpreting, was ever confronted by the
free land of a "world," merely to look at what it encounters. The domi­
nation of the public way in which things have been interpreted has
already decided upon even the possibilities of being attuned, that is,
about the basic way in which Da-sein lets itself be affected by the world.
The they prescribes that attunement, it determines what and how one
"sees."
Idle talk, which closes off in the way we described, is the mode of
being of the uprooted understanding of Da-sein. However, it does not
occur as the objectively present condition of something objectively pre­
s ent, but it is existentially uprooted, and this uprooting is constant.
Ontologically, this means that when Da-sein maintains itself in idle talk,
it is-as being-in-the-world-cut off from the primary and primordially
genuine relations of being toward the world, toward Mitda-sein, toward
being-in itself. It keeps itself in suspension and yet in doing so it is still
always together with the "world," with the others, and toward itself.
Only those beings whose disclosedness is constituted by attuned and
understanding discourse, that is, who are in this ontological constitution
their there, who are "in-the-world," have the possibility of being of such
uprooting which, far from constituting a nonbeing of Da-sein, rather
constitutes its most everyday and stubborn "reality. "
However, i t i s i n the nature of the obviousness and self-assurance
of the average way of being interpreted that under its protection, the
uncanniness of the suspension in which Da-sein can drift toward an
increasing groundlessness remains concealed to actual Da-sein itself.

36. Curiosity
In the analysis of understanding and the disclosedness of the there in
general, we referred to the
b eing-in the

clearing

lumen naturale and call ed the

disclosedness of

of Da-sein in which something like sight first

becomes possible. Sight was conceived with regard to the basic kind of
disclosing characteristic of Da-sein, understanding in the sense of the
genuine appropriation of beings to which Da-sein can be related in
accordance with its essential possibilities of being.
The basic constitution of being of sight shows itself in a peculiar
tendency of being which belongs to everydayness-the tendency toward
"seeing." We designate it with the term curiosity which is characteristically

170

160

I.v

Being and Time

not limited to seeing and expresses the tendency toward a peculiar way
of letting the world be encountered in perception. Our aim in inter­
preting this phenomenon is in principle existential and ontological. We
do not restrict ourselves to an orientation toward cognition. Even in
the early stages of Greek philosophy, and not by accident, cognition
was conceived in terms of the "desire to see." The treatise which stands

171

first in the collection of Aristotle's treatises on ontology begins with the
sentence:

pantes anthropoi tou eidenai oregontai phusei.12 The care for

see­

ing is essential to the being of human being. Thus an inquiry is intro­
duced which attempts to discover the origin of all scientific investigation
of beings and their being by deriving it from the kind of being of Da-sein
which we mentioned. This Greek interpretation of the existential gene­
sis of science is not a matter of chance. It brings to an explicit under­
standing what was prefigured in the statement of Parmenides:

auto noein estin

te

kai einai.

to gar

Being is what shows itself in pure, intuitive

perception, and only this seeing discovers being. Primordial and genuine
truth lies in pure intuition. This thesis henceforth remains the founda­
tion of Western philosophy. The Hegelian dialectic has its motivation in
it, and only on its basis is that dialectic possible.
Above all, it was Augustine who noted the remarkable priority of

concupiscentia.1! Ad
oculos enim videre proprie pertinet, seeing truly belongs to the eyes. Utimur
autem hoc verbo etiam in ceteris sensibus cum eos ad cognoscendum intendimus.
"seeing" in conjunction with his interpretation of

But we use this word "to see" for the other senses, too, when we use
them in order to know. Neque enim dicimus: audi quid rutilet; aut, olefac
quam niteat; auc, gusta quam splendeat; aut, palpa quam fulgeat: videri enim
dicunter haec omnia. For we do not say: hear how that glistens, or smell
how that shines, or taste how that glows, or feel how that gleams; but we
say of each: see, we say that all these things are seen. Dicimus autem non
solum, vide quid luceat, quod soli oculi sentire possunt, nor do we just say: see
how that glows when only the eyes can perceive it, sed etiam, vide quid
sonet; vide quid oleat, vide quid sapiat, vide quid durum sit. We also say:
see how that sounds, see how it smells, see how it tastes, see how hard

ldeoque generalis experientia sensuum concupiscentia sicut dictum est
oculorum vacatur, quia videndi officium in quo primatum oculi tenent, etiam
ceteri sensus sibi de similitudine usurpant, cum aliquid cognitionis explorant.
that is.

Thus because of experience of the senses in general is called "the plea­
sure of the eyes" because the other senses, by a certain resemblance, take
to themselves the function of seeing when it is a knowing something, a
function in which the eyes have priority.

What is it with this tendency to just-perceive? Which existential
constitution of Da-sein becomes intelligible in the phenomenon of
curiosity'

I.v

16 1

Being and Time

Being-in-the-world is initially absorbed in the world taken care of.
Taking care of things is guided by circumspection which discovers things
at hand and preserves them in their discoveredness. Circumspection
gives to all our teaching and performing its route of procedure, the
means of doing something, the right opportunity, the proper moment.
Taking care of things can rest in the sense of one's interrupting the
performance and taking a rest, or of one's finishing something. Taking
care of things does not disappear in rest, but circumspection becomes
free, it is no longer bound to the work-world. When it rests, care turns
into circumspection which has become free. The circumspect discov­

ery of the work-world has the character of being of de-distancing. Cir­
cumspection which has become free no longer has anything at hand
which it has to bring near. Essentially de-distancing, it provides new
possibilities of de-distancing for itself, that is, it tends to leave the things
nearest at hand for a distant and strange world. Care turns into taking
care of possibilities, resting and staying to see the "world" only its

ward appearance.

out­

Da-sein seeks distance solely to bring it near in its out­

ward appearance. Da-sein lets itself be intrigued just by the outward
appearance of the world, a kind of being in which it makes sure that it
gets rid of itself as being-in-the-world, get rid of being with the nearest
everyday things at hand.
When curiosity has become free, it takes care to see not in order to
understand what it sees, that is, to come to a being toward it, but only in
order to see. It seeks novelty only to leap from it again to another nov­
elty. The care of seeing is not concerned with comprehending and know­
ingly being in the truth, but with possibilities of abandoning itself to
the world. Thus curiosity is characterized by a specific

not-staying

with

what is nearest. Consequently, it also does not seek the leisure of reflec­
tive staying, but rather restlessness and excitement from continual nov­
elty and changing encounters. In not-staying, curiosity makes sure of
the constant possibility of distraction. Curiosity has nothing to do with the
contemplation that wonders at being,

thaumazein,

it has no interest in

wondering to the point of not understanding. Rather, it makes sure of
knowing, but just in order to have known. The two factors constitutive
for curiosity,

the surrounding world taken care of and dis-

by new. possibilities, are the basis of the third essential charac-

teristic of this phenomenon, which we call

never dwelling anywhere.

Curiosity is everywhere and nowhere. This mode of being-in-the-world
reveals a new kind of being of everyday

Da-sein,

one in which it con­

stantly uproots itself.
Idle talk also controls the ways in which one may be curious. It says
what one is to have read and seen. The being everywhere and nowhere
of curiosity is entrusted to idle talk. These two everyday modes of being

173

162

I.v

Being and Time

of discourse and sight are not only objectively present side by side in
their uprooting tendency, but

one

way of being drags the

other

with it.

Curiosity, for which nothing is closed off, and idle talk, for which there
is nothing that is not understood, provide themselves (that is, the Da-sein
existing in this way) with the guarantee of a supposedly genuine "lively
life." But with this supposition a third phenomenon shows itself as char­
acterizing the disclosedness of everyday Da-sein.

37. Ambiguity
When in everyday being with one another, we encounter things that
are accessible to everybody and about which everybody can say every­
thing, we can soon no longer decide what is disclosed in genuine under­
standing and what is not. This ambiguity extends not only to the world,
but likewise to being-with-one-another as such, even to the being of Da­
sein toward itself.
Everything looks as if it were genuinely understood, grasped, and
spoken whereas basically it is not, or it does not look that way, yet basi­
cally is. Ambiguity not only affects the way we avail ourselves of what is
accessible for use and enjoyment, and the way we manage it, but it has
already established itself in understanding as a potentiality for being, and
in the way Da-sein projects itself and presents itself with possibilities. Not
only does everyone know and talk about what is the case and what
occurs, but everyone also already knows how to talk about what has to
happen first, which is not yet the case, but "really" should be done.
Everybody has always already guessed and felt beforehand what others
also guess and feel. This being-on-the-track is based upon hearsay-who­
ever is "on the track" of something in a genuine way does not talk about
it-and this is the most entangling way in which ambiguity presents po�
sibilities of Da-sein so that they will already be stifled in their power.
Even supposing that what

they guessed and felt should one day be

actually translated into deeds, ambiguity has already seen to it that the

174

interest for what has been realized will immediately die away. This
interest persists only, after all, in a kind of curiosity and idle talk, only as
long as there is the possibility of a noncommittal just-guessing-with­
someone. When one is on the track, and as long

as

one is on it, being

"in on it" with someone precludes one's allegiance when what was
guessed at is carried out. For then Da-sein is actually forced back upon
itself. Idle talk and curiosity lose their power. And they do take their
revenge. In the light of the actualization of what they also guessed, idle
talk is quick to ascertain that they could have done that, too, for, after
all, they had guessed it, too. In the end, idle talk is indignant that what
it guessed and constantly demanded now

actually happens.

Mter all, the

I.v

Being and Time

163

opportunity to keep guessing is thus snatched away from it.
Since, however, the time span when Da-sein becomes involved in
the reticence of carrying something out, and even of genuinely getting
stranded, is different from that of idle talk which "lives at a quicker
pace, " so that viewed publicly it is essentially slower, idle talk will have
long since gone on to something else, to what is currently the very
newest. That which had been surmised earlier, and has now been carried
out, has come too late with regard to what is the very newest. In their
ambiguity, curiosity and idle talk make sure that what is done in a gen­
uine and new way is outdated as soon as it emerges before the public.
Only then can it become fre e in its positive possibilities, when the idle
talk covering it over has become ineffectual and the "common" interest
has died out.
The ambiguity of the way things have been interpreted publicly
passes off talking about things ahead of time and curious guessing as
what is really happening, and stamps carrying things out and taking
action as something subsequent and of no importance. The under­
standing of Da-sein in the they thus constantly

goes astray in

its proj ects

with regard to the genuine possibilities of being. Da-sein is always
ambiguously "there, " that is, in

the

public disclosedness of being-with­

one-another where the loudest idle talk and the most inventive curiosity
keep the "business" going, where everything happens in an everyday
way, and basically nothing happens at all.
Ambiguity is always tossing to curiosity what it seeks, and it gives to
idle talk the illusion of having everything decided in it.
This kind of being of disclosedness of being-in-the-world, how­
ever, also dominates being-with-one-another as such. The other is initially
"there" in terms of what they have heard about him, what they say and
know about him. Idle talk initially intrudes itself into the midst of primordial being-with-one-another. Everyone keeps track of the other, initially and first of all , watching how he will behave, what he will say to
something. Being-with-one-another in the they is not at all a self-con­
tained, indifferent side-by-sideness, but a tense, ambiguous keeping
track of each other, a secretive, reciprocal listening-in. Under the mask
of the for-one-another, the against-one-another is at play.
Here we must note that ambiguity does not first originate out of an
explicit intention to deceive and distort, that it is not called forth by
the individual Da-sein. It is already implied in being-with-one-another, as

thrown

being-with-one-another in a world. But publicly it is precisely

concealed, and

they

will always protest the possibility that this interpre­

tation of the kind of being of interpreting the they could be correct. It
would be a misunderstanding if the explication of these phenomena
were to seek to be confirmed by the approval of the they.

175

164

I.v

Being and Time

The phenomena of idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity were set
forth in such a way as to indicate that they are already interconnected in
their being. The kind of being of this connection must now be grasped
existentially and ontologically. The basic kind of being of everydayness is
to be understood in the horizon of the structures of the being of Da-sein
hitherto obtained.

38. Falling Prey and Thrownness
Idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity characterize the way in which Da-sein
is its "there," the disclosedness of being-in-the-world, in an everyday
way. As existential determinations, these characteristics are -not objec­
tively present in Da-sein; they constitute its being. In them and in the
connectedness of their being, a basic kind of the being of everydayness
reveals itself, which we call the

entanglement of Da-sein.

This term, which does not express any negative value judgment,
means that Da-sein is initially and for the most part

together with

the

"world" that it takes care of. This absorption in ... mostly has the char­
acter of being lost in the publicness of the they. As an authentic poten­
tiality for being a self, Da-sein has initially always already fallen away
from itself and fallen prey to the "world." Falling prey to the "world"
means being absorbed in being-with-one-another as it is guided by idle
talk, curiosity, and ambiguity. What we called the inauthenticity of Da-

176

sein14 may now be defined more precisely through the interpretation
of falling prey. But inauthentic and unauthentic by no means signify
"not really," as if Da-sein utterly lost its being in this kind of being. Inau­
thenticity does not mean anything like no-longer-being-in-the-world, but
rather it constitutes precisely a distinctive kind of being-in-the-world
which is completely taken in by the world and the Mitda-sein of the oth­
ers in the they. Not-being-its-self functions as a

positive

possibility of

beings which are absorbed in a world, essentially taking care of that
world. This

nonbeing must be conceived as

the kind of being of Da-sein

nearest to it and in which it mostly maintains itself.
Thus neither must the entanglement of Da-sein be interpreted as a
"fall" from a purer and higher "primordial condition." Not only do we
not have any experience of this ontically, but also no possibilities and
guidelines of interpretation ontologically.
As factical being-in-the-world, Da-sein, falling prey, has already
falle n

away from itself;

and it has not fallen prey to some being which it

first runs into in the course of its being, or perhaps does not, but it has
fallen prey to the

world which itself belongs to its being. Falling prey is an

existential determination of Da-sein itself, and says nothing about Da­
sein as something objectively present, or about objectively present rela-

I.v

Being and Time

165

tions to beings from which it is "derived" or to beings with which it has
subsequently gotten into a

commercium.

The ontological-existential structure of falling prey would also be
misunderstood if we wanted to attribute to it the meaning of a bad and
deplorable ontic quality which could perhaps be removed in the
advanced stages of human culture.
Neither in our first reference to being-in-the-world as the funda­
mental constitution of Da-sein nor in our characterization of its consti­
tutive structural factors, did we go beyond an analysis of the constitution
of this kind of being, and note its character as a phenomenon. It is true
that the possible basic kinds of being-in, taking care and concern, were
described. But we did not discuss the question of the everyday kind of
being of these ways of being. It also became evident that being-in is
quite different from a confrontation which merely observes and acts,
that is, the concurrent objective presence of a subject and an object.
Still, it must have seemed that being-in-the-world functions as a rigid
framework within which the possible relations of Da-sein to its world
occur, without the "framework" itself being touched upon in its kind of
being. But this supposed "framework" itself belong to the kind of being
of Da-sein.

An existential mode of being-in-the-world is documented in the

phenomenon of falling prey.
Idle talk discloses to Da-sein a being toward its world, to others and
to itself-a being in which these are understood, but in a mode of
groundless floating. Curiosity discloses each and every thing, but in
such a way that being-in is everywhere and nowhere. Ambiguity conceals nothing from the understanding of Da-sein, but only in order to
suppress being-in-the-world in this uprooted everywhere and nowhere.
With the ontological clarification of the kind of being of everyday
being-in-the-world discernible in these phenomena, we first gain an exis­
tentially adequate determination of the fundamental constitution of Da­
sein. What structure does the "movement" of falling prey show?
Idle talk and the public interpretedness contained in it are consti­
tuted in being-with-one-another. Idle talk is not objectively present for
itself within the world, as a product detached from being-with-one­
another. Nor can it be volatilized to mean something "universal" which,
since it essentially belongs to no one, "really" is nothing and "actually "
only occurs in individual Da-sein that speaks. Idle talk is the kind of
being of being-with-one-another itself, and does not first originate
through certain conditions which influence Da-sein "from the outside."
But when Da-sein itself presents itself with the possibility in idle talk
and public interpretedness of losing itself in the they, of falling prey to
groundlessness, that means that Da-sein prepares for itself the constant
temptation of falling prey. Being-in-the-world is in itself

tempting.

177

166

178

Being and Time

l.v

Having already become a temptation for itself in this way, the way
in which things have been publicly interpreted holds fast to Da-sein in its
falling prey. Idle talk and ambiguity, having-seen-everything and hav­
ing-understood-everything, develop the supposition that the disclosed­
ness ofDa-sein thus available and prevalent could guarantee to Da-sein
the certainty, genuineness, and fullness of all the possibilities of its
being. In the self-certainty and decisiveness of the they, it gets spread
abroad increasingly that there is no need of authentic, attuned under­
standing. The supposition of the they that one is leading and sustaining
a full and genuine "life" brings a tranquillization to Da-sein, for which
everything is in "the best order" and for whom all doors are open.
Entangled being-in-the-world, tempting itself, is at the same time tran­
quillizing.
This tranquillization in inauthentic being, however, does not
seduce one into stagnation and inactivity, but drives one to uninhibited "busyness." Being entangled in the "world" does not somehow
come to rest. Tempting tranquillization aggravates entanglement. With
special regard to the interpretation of Da-sein, the opinion may now
arise that understanding the most foreign cultures and "synthesizing"
them with our own may lead to the thorough and first genuine enlight­
enment ofDa-sein about itself. Versatile curiosity and restlessly knowing
it all masquerade as a universal understanding ofDa-sein. But funda­
mentally it remains undetermined and unasked what is then really to be
understood; nor has it been understood that understanding itself is a
potentiality for being which must become free solely in one's ownmostDa­
sein. When Da-sein, tranquillized and "understanding" everything, thus
compares itself with everything, it drifts toward an alienation in which its
ownmost potentiality for being-in-the-world is concealed. Entangled
being-in-the-world is not only tempting and tranquillizing, it is at the
same time alienating.
However, alienation cannot mean that Da-sein is factically torn
away from itself. On the contrary, this alienation drives Da-sein into a
kind of being intent upon the most exaggerated "self-dissection" which
tries out all kinds of possibilities of interpretation, with the result that the
"characterologies" and "typologies" which it points out are themselves too
numerous to grasp. Yet this alienation, which closes off to Da-sein its
authenticity and possibility, even if only that of genuinely getting
stranded, still does not surrender it to beings which it itself is not, but
forces it into its inauthenticity, into a possible kind of being of itself. The
tempting and tranquillizing alienation of falling prey has its own kind of
movement with the consequence thatDa-sein gets entangled in itself.
The phenomena pointed out of temptation, tranquillizing, alien­
ation, and self-entangling (entanglement) characterize the specific kind

I.v

Being and Time

167

of being of falling prey. We call this kind of "movement" ofDa-sein in its
own being the plunge. Da-sein plunges out of itself into itself, into the
groundlessness and nothingness of inauthentic everydayness. But this
plunge remains concealed from it by the way things have been publicly
interpreted so that it is interpreted as "getting ahead" and "living con­
cretely."
The kind of movement of plunging into and within the ground­
lessness of inauthentic being in the they constantly tears understanding
away from projecting authentic possibilities, and into the tranquillized
supposition of possessing or attaining everything. Since the under­
standing is thus constantly torn away from authenticity and into the
they (although always with a sham of authenticity), the movement of
falling prey is characterized by eddying.
Not only does falling prey determine being-in-the-world existentially; at the same time the eddy reveals the character of throwing and
movement of thrownness which can force i tself upon Da-sein in its
attunement. Not only is thrownness not a "finished fact," it is also not a
self-contained fact. The facticity ofDa-sein is such thatDa-sein, as long as
it is what it is, remains in the throw and is sucked into the eddy of the
they's inauthenticity. Thrownness, in which facticity can be seen phe­
nomenally, belongs toDa-sein, which is concerned in its being about that
being. Da-sein exists factically .
But now that falling prey has been exhibited, have we not set forth
a phenomenon which directly speaks against the definition in which the
formal idea of existence was indicated? Can Da-sein be conceived as a
being whose being is concerned with potentiality for being if this being
has lost itself precisely in its everydayness and "lives" away from itself in
falling prey? Falling prey to the world is, however, phenomenal "evi­
dence" against the existentiality ofDa-sein only ifDa-sein is posited as an
isolated !-subj ect, as a self-point from which it moves away. Then the
world is an object. Falling prey to the world is then reinterpreted onto­
logically as objective presence in the manner of innerworldly beings.
However, if we hold on to the being ofDa-sein in the constitution indi­
cated of being-in-the-world, it becomes evident that falling prey as the kind
of being of this being-in rather represents the most elemental proof for
the existentiality of Da-sein. In falling prey, nothing other than our
potentiality for being-in-the-world is the issue, even if in the mode of
inauthenticity. Da-sein can fall prey only because it is concerned with
understanding, attuned being-in-the-world. On the other hand, authentic
existence is nothing which hovers over entangled everydayness, but is
existentially only a modified grasp of everydayness.
Nor does the phenomenon of falling prey give something like a
"night view" ofDa-sein, a property occurring ontically which might serve

179

168

I.v

Being and Time

to round out the harmless aspect of this being. Falling prey reveals an

essential,

ontological structure of Da-sein itself. Far from determining

its nocturnal side, it constitutes all of its days in their everydayness.
Our existential, ontological interpretation thus does not make any
ontic statement about the "corruption of human nature," not because the

180

necessary evidence is lacking but because its problematic is prior

to

any

statement about corruption or incorruption. Falling prey is an ontologi­
cal concept of motion. Ontically, we have not decided whether human
being is "drowned in sin," in the status corru.ptionis, or whether he walks in
the status

integritatis

or finds himself in an interim stage, the status gratiae.

But faith and "worldview," when they state such and such a thing and
when they speak about Da-sein as being-in-the-world, must come back to
the existential structures set forth, provided that their statements at the
same time claim to be

conceptually comprehensible.

The leading question of this chapter pursued the being of the
there. Its theme was the ontological constitution of the disclosedness
essentially belonging to Da-sein. The being of disclosedness is consti­
tuted in attunement, understanding, and discourse. Its everyday mode of
being is characterized by idle

talk, curiosity, and ambiguity. These show

the kind of movement of falling prey with the essential characteristics of
temptation, tranquillization, alienation, and entanglement.
But with this analysis the totality of the existential constitution of
Da-sein has been laid bare in its main features and the phenomenal
basis has been obtained for a "comprehensive" interpretation of the
being of Da-sein as care.

clarified phenomenally as a whole and, always on this basis, in its con­
stitutive moments. The preview given at the beginning1 of the whole of
the phenomenon has now lost the emptiness of its first general prefig­
uration. However, the phenomenal

manifoldness

of the constitution of

the structural whole and its everyday kind of being can now easily distort
the

unified

phenomenological view of the whole as such. But this view

must be held in readiness more freely and more securely when we now
ask the question toward which the preparatory fundamental analysis of
Da-sein was striving in general: How

is the totality of the structural whole that
we pointed out to be determined existentially and ontologically?
Da-sein exists factically. We are asking about the ontological unity
of existentiality and facticity, namely, whether facticity belongs essentially
to existentiality. On the basis of the attunement essentially belonging to
it, Da-sein has a mode of being in which it is brought before itself and it
is disclosed to itself in its throwness. But throwness is the mode of being
of a being which always

is

itself its possibilities in such a way that it

understands itself in them and from them (projects itself upon them).
Being-in-the-world, to which being together with things at hand belongs
just as primordially as being-with others, is always for the sake of itself.
But the self is initially and for the most part inauthentic, the they-self.

169

181

170

I. VI

Being and Time

Being-in-the-world is always already entangled. The average everydayness of
Da-sein can thus be determined as entangled-disclosed, thrown-projecting
being-in-the-world which is concerned with its ownmost potentiality in its being
together with the "world" and in being-with with the others.
Can we succeed in grasping this structural whole of the everyday­
ness of Da-sein in its totality? Can the being of Da-sein be delineated in
a unified way so that in terms of it the essential equiprimordiality of
the structures pointed out becomes intelligible, together with the exis­
tential possibilities of modification which belong to it? Is there a way to
attain this being phenomenally on the basis of the present point of
departure of the existential analytic?
To put it negatively, it is beyond question that the totality of the
structural whole is not to be reached phenomenally by means of cob­
bling together elements. This would require a blueprint. The being of
Da-sein, which ontologically supports the structural whole as such,
becomes accessible by completely looking

through this whole at a pri­

mordially unified phenomenon which already lies in the whole in such a
way that it is the ontological basis for every structural moment in its
structural possibility. Thus a "comprehensive" interpretation cannot
consist of a process of piecing together what we have hitherto gained.
The question of Da-sein's existential character is essentially different
from the question of the being of something objectively present. Every­
day experience of the surrounding world, which is directed ontically
and ontologically to innerworldly beings, cannot present Da-sein onti-

182

cally and primordially for the ontological analysis. Similarly, our imma­
nent perception of experiences is lacking an ontologically sufficient
guideline. On the other hand, the being of Da-sein is not to be deduced
from an idea of human being. Can we gather from our previous inter­
pretation of Da-sein what antic-ontological access to itself it requires,

from itself, as the sole appropriate one?
An understanding of being belongs to the ontological structure
of Da-sein. In existing, it is disclosed to itself in its being. Attunement
and understanding constitute the kind of being of this disclosedness. Is
there

an

understanding attunement in Da-sein in which it is disclosed to

itself in a distinctive way?
If the existential analytic of Da-sein is to keep a fundamental clarity
as to its basic ontological function, it must search for one of the

most far­
reaching and most primordial possibilities of disclosure which lie in Da-sein
itself for mastering its preliminary task, that of setting forth the being of
Da-sein. The kind of disclosure in which Da-sein brings itself before itself
must be such that in it Da-sein becomes accessible to itself, so to speak, in
a simplified way. Together with what has been disclosed to it, the structural
whole of the being we seek must then come to light in an elemental way.

Being and Time

171

As a kind of attunement adequate for such methodical require­
ments, we shall take the phenomenon of

Angst as the basis of analysis.

The elaboration of this fundamental kind of attunement and the onto­
logical characteristics of what is disclosed in it as such take their point of
departure from the phenomenon of entanglement, and distinguish Angst
from the related phenomenon of fear analyzed earlier. As a possibility of
being of Da-sein, together with the Da-sein itself disclosed in it,

Angst

provides the phenomenal basis for explicitly grasping the primordial
totality of being of Da-sein. Its being reveals itself as care. The ontologi­
cal development of this fundamental existential phenomenon demands
that we differentiate it from phenomena which at first might seem to be
identified with care. Such phenomena are will, wish, predilection, and
urge. Care cannot be derived from them because they are themselves
founded upon it.
Uke any ontological analysis, the ontological interpretation of Da­
sein as care, with whatever can be gained from the interpretation, is far
removed from what is accessible to the pre-ontological understanding of
being or even to our ontic acquaintance with beings. That the common
understanding estranges what is known ontologically by referring it to
that with which it is solely ontically acquainted, is not surprising.
Nonetheless, even the ontic approach with which we have tried to interpret Da-sein ontologically as care might appear to be contrived in a far­
fetched and theoretical way; not to speak of the act of violence which
one might discern in the exclusion of the traditional and cherished def­
inition of human being. Thus we need a pre-ontological confirmation of
the existential interpretation of Da-sein as care. It lies in demonstrating
that as soon as Da-sein expressed anything about itself, it has already
interpreted itself as care

(cura), although only pre-ontologically.

The analytic of Da-sein which penetrates to the phenomenon of
care is to prepare the way for the fundamental, ontological problematic,

the question of the meaning of being in general. In order to direct our view
explicitly to this in the light of what we have gained, and go beyond the
special task of an existential, a priori anthropology, the phenomena which
are most intimately connected with the leading question of being must
be grasped more precisely in hindsight. They are the modes of being
explained hitherto: handiness and objective presence which determine
innerworldly beings unlike Da-sein. Because the ontological problematic
has hitherto understood being primarily in the sense of objective pres­
ence ("reality," "world"-actuality), while the being of Da-sein remained
ontologically undetermined, we need to discuss the ontological con­
nection of care, worldliness, handiness, and objective presence (real­
ity). That leads to a more exact determination of the concept of

reality in

the context of a discussion of the epistemological questions oriented

183

172

I. VI

Being and Time

toward this idea which have been raised by realism and idealism .
Beings

are

independently o f th e experience, cognition, and com­

prehension through which they are disclosed, discovered, and deter­
mined. But being "is" only in the understanding* of that being to whose
being something like an understanding of being belongs. Thus being can
be unconceptualized, but it is never completely uncomprehended. In
ontological problematics,

being and truth

have been brought together

since ancient times, if not even identified. This documents the necessary
connection of being and understanding,t although perhaps concealed in
its primordial grounds . Thus for an adequate preparation of the ques­
tion of being, we need an ontological clarification of the phenomenon of

truth.

This will be accomplished initially on the basis of that which our

interpretation hitherto has gained with the phenomena of disclosed­
ness and discoveredness, interpretation and statement.

40. The Fundamental Attunement of Angst

as

an

Eminent Disclosedness of Da-sein
One possibility of being of Da-sein is to give ontic "information" about
itself as a being. Such information is possible only in the disclosedness
belonging to Da-sein which is based on attunement and understanding.
To what extent is

Angst a distinctive attunement?

How is Da-sein brought

before itself in it through its own being so that phenomenologically the
b eing disclosed in

Angst

is defined as such in its b eing, or adequate

preparations can be made for doing so?
With the intention of penetrating to the being of the totality of the
structural whole, we shall take our point of departure from the con­
crete analysis of entanglement carried out in the las t chapter. The
absorption of Da-sein in the they and in the "world" taken care of reveals
something like a flight of Da-sein from itself as an authentic potentiality
for being itself. This phenomenon of the flight of Da-sein from

I. VI

173

Being and Time

its authenticity seems, however, to be least appropriate to serve as a
phenomenal foundation for the following inquiry. In this flight, Da-sein
precisely does not bring itself before itself. In accordance with its own­
most trait of entanglement, this turning away leads

away from

Da-sein.

But in investigating such phenomena, our inquiry must guard against
conflating ontic-existentiell characteristics with ontological-existential
interpretation, and must not overlook the positive, phenomenal foun­
dations provided for this interpretation by such a characterization.
It is true that existentielly the authenticity of being a self is closed
off and repressed in entanglement, but this closing off is only the priva­

tion

of a disclosedness which reveals itself phenomenally in the fact that

the flight of Da-sein is a flight from itself. That from which Da-sein flees
is precisely what Da-sein comes up "behind." Only because Da-sein is
ontologically and essentially brought before itself by the disclosedness
belonging to it, can it flee from that from which it flees. Of course, in this
entangled turning away, that from which it flees is
experienced in a turning toward it. But in

not grasped, nor is it
turning away from it, it is

"there," disclosed. On account of its character of being disclosed, this
existentielly-ontic turning away makes it phenomenally possible to grasp
existentially and ontologically what the flight is from. Within the ontic
"away from" which lies in turning away, that from which Da-sein flees
can be understood and conceptualized by "turning toward" in a way
which is phenomenologically interpretive.
Thus the orientation of our analysis toward the phenomenon of
entanglement is not condemned in principle to be without any prospect
of ontologically experiencing something about the Da-sein disclosed in
that phenomenon. On the contrary, it is just here that our interpretation
is the least likely to be surrendered to an artificial self-conception of
Da-sein. It only carries the explication of what Da-sein itself discloses
ontically. The possibility of penetrating to the being of Da-sein by going
along with it and pursuing it interpretatively in an attuned understand­
ing increases, the more primordially that phenomenon is which func­
tions methodologically as disclosive attunement. To say that

Angst

accomplishes something like this is only an assertion for now.
We are not completely unprepared for the analysis of

Ang-st.

It is

true that we are still in the dark as to how it is ontologically connected
with fear. Obviously they are kindred phenomena. What tells us this is
the fact that both phenomena remain mostly undifferentiated, and we
designate as Ang-st what is really fear and call fear what has the character
of

A ngst.

We shall attempt to penetrate to the phenomenon of

Ang-st

step by step.
The falling prey of Da-sein to the they and the "world" taken care
of, we called a "flight" from itself. But not every shrinking back from . . . ,

185

1 74

186

Being and Time

I. VI

not every turning away from . . . is necessarily flight. Shrinking back
from what fear discloses, from what is threatening, is founded upon fear
and has the character of flight. Our interpretation of fear as attunement
showed that what we fear is always a detrimental innerworldy being,
approaching nearby from a definite region, which may remain absent. In
falling prey, Da-sein turns away from itself. What it shrinks back from
must have a threatening character; yet this being has the same kind of
being as the one which shrinks back from it-it is Da-sein itself. What it
shrinks back from cannot be grasped as something "fearsome"; because
anything fearsome is always encountered as an innerworldly being. The
only threat which can be "fearsome" and which is discovered in fear
always comes from innerworldly beings.
The turning away of falling prey is thus not a flight which is based
on a fear of innerworldly beings. Any flight based on that kind of fear
belongs still less to turning away, as turning away precisely turns toward
innerworldly beings while absorbing itself in them. The turning away of
falling prey is rather based on Angst which in turn first makes fear possible.
In order to understand this talk about the entangled flight of Da­
sein from itself, we must recall that being-in-the-world is the basic con­
stitution of Da-sein. That about which one has Angst is being-in-the-world as
such. How is what An�t is anxious about phenomenally differentiated
from what fear is afraid of? What An�t is about is not an innerworldly
being. Thus it essentially cannot be relevant. The threat does not have
the character of a definite detrimentality which concerns what is threat­
ened with a definite regard to a particular factical potentiality for being.
What Angst is about is completely indefinite. This indefiniteness not
only leaves factically undecided which innerworldly being is threatening
us, but also means that innerworldly beings in general are not "rele­
vant." Nothing of that which is at hand and objectively present within the
world, functions as what Angst is anxious about. The totality of rele­
vance discovered within the world of things at hand and objectively pre­
sent is completely without importance. It collapses . The world has the
character of complete insignificance. In An�t we do not encounter this
or that thing which, as threatening, could be relevant
Thus neither does An�t "see" a definite "there" and "over here"
from which what is threatening approaches. The fact that what is threat­
ening is nowhere characterizes what Angst is about. An�t "does not know"
what it is about which it is anxious. But "nowhere" does not mean noth­
ing; rather, region in general lies therein, and disclosedness of the world
in general for essentially spatial being-in. Therefore, what is threatening
cannot approach from a definite direction within nearness, it is already
"there"-and yet nowhere. It is so near that it is oppressive and stifles
one's breath-and yet it is nowhere.

I. VI

175

Being and Time

In what

Angst

is about, the "it is nothing and nowhere" becomes

manifest. The recalcitrance of the innerworldly nothing and nowhere
means phenomenally that

what

Angst

is about is the world

as

such.

The

utter insignifican c e which makes itself known in the nothing and
nowhere does not signify the absence of world, but means that inner­
worldly beings in themselves are so completely unimportant that, on
the basis of this

insignificance of what is innerworldly,

the world is all that

obtrudes itself in its worldliness.
What oppresses us is not this or that, nor is it everything obj ec­
tively present together as a sum, but the
general, that is, the world itself. When

possibility of things at hand in
Angst has quieted down, in our

everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say "it was really nothing."
This way of talking, indeed, gets at

what

it was ontically. Everyday dis­

course aims at taking care of things at hand and talking about them.
That about which Angst is anxious is none of the innerworldly things at
hand. But this "none of the things at hand, " which is all that everyday,
circumspect discourse understands, is not a total nothing. The nothing
of handiness is based on the primordial "something, " * on the

world.

The world, however, ontologically belongs essentially to the being of
Da-sein as being-in-the-world. So if what

Angst is about exposes noth­
that about which Angst is

ing, that is, the world as such, this means that

anxious is being-in-the-world itself. t

Being anxious discloses, primordially and directly, the world as
world. It is not the case that initially we deliberately look away from
innerworldly beings and think only of the world about which
arises, but

world.

Angst

as a mode of attunement first discloses the

Angst
world as

However, that does not mean that the worldliness of the world is

conceptualized in

Angst.
A ngst is not only Angst about . . . , but is at the same time, as attune­
ment, Angst for . . . . That for which Angst is anxious is not a definite kind
of being and possibility of Da-sein. The threat itself is, after all, indefinite
and thus cann o t penetrate threateningly to this or that factically concrete
potentiality of being. What

Angst

is anxious for is b eing-in-the-world

itself. In Angst, the things at hand in the surrounding world sink away,
and so do innerworldly beings in general. The "world" can offer nothing
more, nor can the

Mitda-sein of others.

Thus Angst takes away from Da­

sein the possibility of understanding itself, falling prey, in terms of the
"world" and the public way of being interpreted. It throws Da-sein back
upon that for which it is anxious, its authentic potentiality-for-being-in*

I.v1

Angst individuates Da-sein to

its ownmost being-in-the-world

which, as understanding, projects itself essentially upon possibilities.
Thus along with that for which it is anxious,

Angst discloses Da-sein as
being-possible, and indeed as what can be individualized in individuation

of its own accord.

Angst reveals in Da-sein its being toward its ownmost potentiality of
beingfree for the freedom of choosing and grasping itself.
Angst brings Da-sein before its being free for . . . (propensio in ) , the authen­
being, that is,

ticity of its being as possibility which it always already is. But at the same
time, it is this being to which Da-sein as being-in-the-world is entrusted.
That

about which Angst is anxious reveals itself as that for which it is

anxious: being-in-the-world. The identity of that about which and that for
which one has

Angst

extends even to anxiousness itself. For as attune­

ment, anxiousness is a fundamental mode of being-in-the-world.

The
existential identity of disclosing and what is disclosed so that in what is disclosed
the world is disclosed as world, as being-in, individualized, pure, thrown poten­
tiality for being, makes it clear that with the phenomenon of Angst a distinctive
kind of attunement has become the theme of our interpretation. Angst individ­
ualizes and thus discloses Da-sein as "solus ipse." This existential "solip­
sism," however, is so far from transposing an isolated subject-thing into
the harmless vacuum of a worldless occurrence that it brings Da-sein in
an extreme sense precisely before its world as world, and thus itself
before itself as being-in-the-world.
Again, everyday discourse and the everyday interpretation of Da­
sein furnish the most unbiased evidence that

Angst

as a basic attune­

ment is disclosive in this way. We said earlier that attunement reveals
"how one is." In

Angst one has an " uncanny"

feeling. Here the peculiar

indefiniteness of that which Da-sein finds itself involved in with A ngst ini­
tially finds expression: the nothing and nowhere. But uncanniness
means at the same time not-being-at-home. In our first phenomenal
indication of the fundamental constitution of Da-sein and the clarifica­
tion of the existential meaning of being-in in contradistinction to the cat­
egorial signification of "insideness," being-in was defined as dwelling
with . . . , being familiar with . . .

.2

This characteristic of being-in was

then made more concretely visible through the everyday publicness of

1 89

the they which brings tranquillized self-assurance, "being-at-home" with
all its obviousness, into the average everydayness of Da-sein.'

Angst,

on

the other hand, fetches Da-sein back out of its entangled absorption in
the "world." Everyday familiarity collapses. Da-sein is individuated, but
being-in-the-world. Being-in enters the existential "mode" of

home.

as
not-being-at­

The talk about "uncanniness" means nothing other than this.
Now, however, what falling prey, as flight, is fleeing from becomes

phenomenally visible. It is not a flight from innerworldly beings, but

I. VI

177

Being and Time

precisely

toward

them as the beings among which taking care of things,

lost in the they, can linger in tranquillized familiarity. Entangled flight

into

the being-at-home of publicness is flight from not-being-at-home,

that is, from the uncanniness which lies in Da-sein as thrown, as being-in­
the-world entrusted to itself in its being. This uncanniness constantly
pursues Da-sein and threatens its everyday lostness in the they, although
not explicitly. This threat can factically go along with complete security
and self-sufficiency of the everyday way of taking care of things.

An83t

can arise in the most harmless situations. Nor does it have any need
for darkness, in which things usually become uncanny to us more easily.
In the dark there is emphatically "nothing" to see, although the world is

still " there" more obt1USively.
If we interpret the uncanniness of Da-sein existentially and onto­
logically as a threat which concerns Da-sein itself and which comes from
Da-sein itself, we are not asserting that uncanniness has always already
been understood in fac tical

An83t

in this sense. The everyday way in

which Da-sein understands uncanniness is the entangled turning away
which "phases out" not-being-at-home. The everydayness of this flee­
ing, however, shows phenomenally that A ngst as a fundamental kind of
attunement belongs to the essential constitution of Da-sein of being in
-

the-world which, as an existential one, is never obj ectively present, but

­

is

itself always in the mode of factical Da-sein, that is, in the mode of an
attunement. Tranquillized, familiar being-in-the-world is a mode of the
uncanniness of Da-sein, not the other way around. Not-being-at-home*
must be conceived existentially and ontologically as the more primordial phe­
nomenon.
And only because Angst always already latently detennines being-in­
the-world, can being-in-the-world, as being together with the "world"
taking care of things and attuned, be afraid. Fear is

Angst

which has

fallen prey to the "world." It is inauthentic and concealed from itself as
such.
Factically, the mood of uncanniness remains for the most part
existentielly uncomprehended. Moreover, with the dominance of falling
prey and publicness, "real"

An83t is rare. Often, Angst is "physiologiontological problem in its facticity, not

cally" conditioned. This fact is an

only with regard to its antic causes and course of development. The
physiological triggering of Angst is possible only because Da-sein is

anx-

ious in the very ground of its being.
Still more rare than the exis tentiell fact of real

Angst

are the

attempts to interpret this phenomenon in its fundamental, existential-

190

1 78

Being and Time

ontological constitution and function. The reasons for this lie partly in
the general neglect of the existential analytic of Da-sein, particularly in
the failure to recognize the phenomenon of attunement.4 The factical
rarity of the phenomenon of

Ang.5t,

however, cannot deprive it of its

suitability for taking over a methodical function

in principle for the exis­

tential analytic. On the contrary, the rarity of the phenomenon is an
indication of the fact that Da-sein, which mostly remains concealed from
itself in its authenticity on account of the public way of being inter­
preted of the they, can be disclosed in a primordial sense in its funda­
mental attunement.
It is true that it is the nature of every kind of attunement to disclose
complete being-in-the-world in all its constitutive factors (world, being-in,

191

self). However, in Ang.5t there lies the possibility of a distinctive disclosure,
since Angst individualizes. lbis individualizing fetches Da-sein back from its
falling prey and reveals to it authenticity and inauthenticity as possibilities
of its being. The fundamental possibilities of Da-sein, which is always my
own,* show themselves in

Ang.5t as

they are, undistorted by innerworldly

beings to which Da-sein, initially and for the most part, clings.
To what extent has this existential interpretation of Ang.5t, gained a
phenomenal basis for the answering the leading question of the being of
the totality of the structural whole of Da-sein?

41. The Being of Da-sein

as

Care

With the intention of grasping the totality of the structural whole onto­
logically, we must first ask whether the phenomenon of Ang.5t and what
is disclosed in it are able to give the whole of Da-sein in a way that is phe­
nomenally equiprimordial, so that our search for totality can be ful­
filled in this givenness. The total content of what lies in it can be enu­
merated: As attunement, being anxious is a way of being-in-the-world;
that about which we have

Ang.5t is thrown being-in-the-world; that for
Ang.5t is our potentiality-for-being-in-the-world. The com­
plete phenomenon of Ang.5t thus shows Da-sein as factical, existing being­
which we have

in-the-world. The fundamental, ontological characteristics of this being
are existentiality, facticity, and falling prey. These existential determi­
nations are not pieces belonging to something composite, one of which
might sometimes be missing, but a primordial content is woven in them
which constitutes the totality of the structural whole that we are seeking.
In the unity of the determinations of being of Da-sein that we have men­

Da-sein is a b eing which is concerned in its being about that b eing
The "is concerned about . . . " has become clearer in the constitution of
being of understanding as self-proj ective being toward its ownmost
potentiality-for-being. This potentiality is that for the sake of which any
Da-sein is as it is. Da-sein has always already compared itself, in its being,
with a possibility of itself. Being free for its ownmost potentiality-for­
being, and thus for the possibility of authenticity and inauthenticity,
shows itself in a primordial, elemental concretion in Ang.5t. But onto­
logically, being toward one's ownmost potentiality-for-being means that
Da-sein is always already ahead of itself in its being. Da-sein is always
already "beyond itself," not as a way of behaving toward beings which it
is not, but as being toward the potentiali ty-for-b e ing which it itself is.
This structure of being of the essential "being concerned about" we for­
mulate as the being-ahead-ofitself of Da-sein.
But this structure concerns the whole of the constitution of Da-sein.
Being-ahead-of-itself does not mean anything like an isolated tendency in a
worldless "subject," but characterizes being-in-the-world. But to being-in-the­
world b elongs the fact that it is entrusted to itself, that it is always already
thrown into a world. The fact that Da-sein is entrusted to itself shows itself
primordially and concretely in Anglt. More completely formulated, being­
ahead-ot:itself means being-ahead-()fU.selfin-already-being-in-a-world. As soon as
this essentially unitary structure is seen phenomenally, what we worked out
earlier in the analysis of worldliness also becomes clearer. There we found
that the referential totality of significance (which is constitutive for world­
liness) is "anchored" in a for-the-sake-ot:which. The fact that this referential
totality, of the manifold relations of the in-order-to, is bound up with that
which Da-sein is concerned about, does not signify that an objectively pre­
sent "world" of objects is welded together with a subject. Rather, it is the
phenomenal expression of the fact that the constitution of Da-sein, whose
wholeness is now delineated explicitly as being-ahead-of-itself-in-already­
being-in . . is primordially a whole. Expressed differently: existing is always
factical. Existentiality is essentially detennined by facticity.
Furthermore, the factical existing of Da-sein is not only in general
and indifferently a thrown po tentiality-for-being-in-the-world, but is
always already also absorbed in the world taken care of. In this entangled
being-together-with, fleeing from uncanniness (which mostly remains
covered over by latent Ang.5t be cau se the publicness of the they sup­
presses everything unfamiliar) announces i ts elf, whether it does so
explicitly or not, and whether it is understood or not. In being-ahead-of­
oneself-already-being-in-the-world, entangled being-togeth er with inner­
worldly things at hand taken care of lies essentially included.
The formal existential totality of the ontological structural whole of
Da-sein must thus be formulated in the following structure: The b eing of

Da-sein means being-ahead-of-oneself-already-in (the world) as being­
together-with (innerworldly beings encountered). This being fills in the
significance of the term care, which is used in a purely ontological and
existential way.Any ontically intended tendency of being, such as worry
or carefreeness, is ruled out.
193

Since being-in-the-world is essentially care, being-together-with
things at hand could be taken in our previous analyses as taking care of
them, being with the Mitda-sein of others encountered within the world
as concern. Being-together-with is taking care of things, because as a
mode of being-in it is determined by its fundamental structure, care.
Care not only characterizes existentiality, abstracted from facticity and
falling prey, but encompasses the unity of these determinations of being.
Nor does care mean primarily and exclusively an isolated attitude of
the ego toward itself. The expression "care for oneself," following the
analogy of taking care and concern, would be a tautology. Care cannot
mean a special attitude toward the self, because the self is already char­
acterized ontologically as being-ahead-of-itself; but in this determina­
tion the other two structural moments of care, already-being-in ...and
being-together-with, are also posited.
In being-ahead-of-oneself as the being toward one's ownmost
potentiality-of-being lies the existential and ontological condition of
the possibility of being free for authentic existentiell possibilities. It is
the potentiality-for-being for the sake of which Da-sein always is as it fac­
tically is. But since this being toward the potentiality-for-being is itself
determined by freedom, Da-sein can also be related to its possibilities
unwillingly, it can be inauthentic, and it is so factically initially and for

the most part. The authentic for-the-sake-of-which remains ungrasped,
the project of one's potentiality-of-being is left to the disposal of the
they. Thus in being-ahead-of-itself, the "self' actually means the self in
the sense of the they-self.Even in inauthenticity, Da-sein remains essen­
tially ahead-of-itself, just as the entangled fleeing of Da-sein from itself
still shows the constitution of being of a being that is concerned about its
being.

As a primordial structural totality, care lies "before" every factical
"attitude" and "position" of Da-sein, that is, it is always already in them
as an existential a priori. Thus this phenomenon by no means expresses
a priority of "practical" over theoretical behavior. When we determine
something objectively present by merely looking at it, this has the char­
acter of care just as much as a "political action," or resting and having a
good time. "Theory" and "praxis" are possibilities of being for a being
whose being must be defined as care.
The phenomenon of care in its totality is essentially something
that cannot be split up; thus any attempts to derive it from special acts or

I. VI

Being and Time

181

drives such as willing and wishing or urge and predilection, or of constructing it out of them, will be unsuccessful.
Willing and wishing are necessarily rooted ontologically in Da-sein
as care, and are not simply ontologically undifferentiated experiences
which occur in a "stream" that is completely indeterminate as to the
meaning of its being. This is no less true for predilection and urge.
They, too, are based upon care insofar as they are purely demonstrable
in Da-sein in general. This does not exclude the fact that urge and
predilection are ontologically constitutive even for beings which are
only "alive." The basic ontological constitution of "living," however, is a
problem in its own right and can be developed only reductively and
privatively in terms of the ontology of Da-sein
Care is ontologically "prior" to the phenomena we mentioned,
which can, of course, always be adequately "described" within certain
limits without the complete ontological horizon needing to be visible or
even known as such. For the present fundamental ontological study,
which neither aspires to a thematically complete ontology of Da-sein
nor even to a concrete anthropology, it must suffice to suggest how
these phenomena are existentially based in care.
The potentiality-for-being for the sake of which Da-sein is, has itself
the mode of being of being-in-the-world. Accordingly, the relation to
innerworldly beings lies in it ontologically. Even if only privatively, care is
always taking care of things and concern. In willing, a being that is under­
stood, that is, projected upon its possibility, is grasped as something to be
taken care of or to be brought to its being through concern. For this rea­
son, something willed always belongs to willing, something which has
already been determined in terms of a for the-sake-of-which. If willing is
to be possible ontologically, the following factors are constitutive for it:
the previous disclosedness of the for-the-sake-of-which in general {being­
ahead-of-oneself), the disclosedness of what can be taken care of (world as
the wherein of already-being), and the understanding self-projection of
Da-sein upon a potentiality-for-being toward a possibility of the being
"willed." The underlying totality of care shows through in the phe­
nomenon of willing.
As something factical, the understanding self-projection of Da-sein
is always already together with a discovered world. From this world it
takes its possibilities, initially in accordance with the interpretedness of
the they. This interpretation has from the outset restricted the possible
options of choice to the scope of what is familiar, attainable, feasible, to
what is correct and proper. The levelling down of the possibilities of Dasein to what is initially available in an everyday way at the same time
results in a phasing out of the possible as such. The average everydayness
of taking care of things becomes blind to possibility and gets tranquil-

194

195

182

196

Being and Time

I. VI

lized with what is merely "real." This tranquillization not only does not
rule out a high degree of busyness in taking care of things, it arouses it.
It is not the case that positive, new possibilities are then willed, but what
is available is "tactically" changed in such a way that there is an illusion of
something happening.
All the same, under the leadership of the they, this tranquillized
"willing" does not signify that being toward one's potentiality-for-being
has been extinguished, but only that it has been modified. Being toward
possibilities then shows itself for the most part as mere wishing. In the
wish, Da-sein projects its being toward possibilities which not only
remain ungrasped in taking care of things, but whose fulfillment is not
even thought about and expected. On the contrary, the predominance
of being-ahead-of-itself in the mode of mere wishing brings with it a
lack of understanding of factical possibilities. Being-in-the-world whose
world is primarily projected as a wish-world has lost itself utterly in what
is available, but in such a way that in the light of what is wished for,
what is available (all the things at hand) is never enough. Wishing is an
existential modification of understanding self-projection which, having
fallen prey to thrownness, solely hankers after possibilities. This hankering
after closes off possibilities; what is "there" in such wishful hankering
becomes the "real world." Ontologically, wishing presupposes care.
In hankering, being-in-the-world-already-among .. . has priority.
Being-ahead-of-itself-in-already-being-in is modified accordingly. Entan­
gled hankering reveals the predilection of Da-sein to be "lived" by the
world in which it actually is. Predilection shows the character of being
out for something. Being-ahead-of-itself has gotten lost in a just-always­
already-among. The "toward" of predilection lets itself be attracted by
what predilection hankers after. When Da-sein, so to speak, sinks down
into predilection, a predilection is not just objectively present, but the
complete structure of care is modified. Blinded, it puts all possibilities in
the services of the predilection.
On the other hand, the urge "to live" is a "toward" which brings its
own drive along with it. It is "toward at any cost." Urge seeks to crowd
out other possibilities. Here, too, being-ahead-of-oneself is inauthentic if
one is invaded by an urge coming from the very thing that is urging
one on. The urge can outrun one's actual attunement and understanding. But then Da-sein is not-and never is-a "mere urge" to which other
relations of dominating and leading are sometimes added, but as a mod­
ification of complete being-in-the-world, it is always already care.
In pure urge, care has not yet become free, although it first makes
it ontologically possible for Da-sein to be urged on by itself. On the
other hand, in predilection care is always already bound. Predilection
and urge are possibilities rooted in the thrownness of Da-sein. The urge

I. VI

Being and Timl!

183

"to live" is not to be destroyed; the predilection to be "lived" by the
world is not to be eradicated. But because and only because they are
ontologically based in care, both are to be modified ontically and exis­
tentielly by care as something authentic.
The expression "care" means an existential and basic ontological
phenomenon which is yet is not simple in its structure. This ontologi­
cally elemental totality of the care structure cannot be reduced to an
ontic "primal element," just as being certainly cannot be "explained" in
terms of beings. Finally, we shall see that the idea of being in general is no
more "simple" than the being of Da-sein. The characterization of care as
"being-ahead-of-itself-in-already-being-in"-as being-together-with-makes
it clear that this phenomenon, too, is yet structurally articulated in itself.
But is that not a phenomenal indication that the ontological question
must be pursued still further until we can set forth a still more primordial
phenomenon which ontologically supports the unity and totality of the
structural manifold of care? Before we follow up this question, we need
to appropriate in hindsight and more precisely what has been inter­
preted up to now with the intention of seeing the fundamental ontolog­
ical question of the meaning of being in general. But first we must show
that what is ontologically "new" in this interpretation is ontically rather
old. The explication of the being of Da-sein as care does not force Da-sein
under a contrived idea, but brings us existentially nearer to the concept
of what has already been disclosed ontically and existentielly.
42.

Confirmation of the Existential Interpretation of Da-sein as
Care in Terms of the Pre-ontological Self-interpretation of Da-sein

In the foregoing interpretations, which finally led to exposing care as the
being of Da-sein, the most important thing was to arrive at the appropriate ontological foundations of the being which we ourselves actually
are and which we call "human being." For this purpose, it was necessary
from the outset to change the direction of our analysis from the
approach presented by the traditional defmition of human being, which
is an approach ontologically unclarified and fundamentall y questionable. In comparison with this definition, the existential and ontological
interpretation might seem strange, especially if "care" is understood
just ontically as "worry" and "troubles." Accordingly, we shall cite a doc­
ument that is pre-ontological in character, even though its demonstrative
power is "only historical."
Let us bear in mind, however, that in this document Da-sein
expresses itself about itself "primordially," unaffected by any theoretical
interpretation and without aiming to propose any. Furthermore, let us
observe that the being of Da-sein is characterized by historicality, though

1 97

184

Being and Time

I. VI

this must first be demonstrated ontologically. .lf Da-sein is "historical" in
the basis of its being, a statement that comes from its history and goes
back to it and that, moreover, is prior to any scientific knowledge takes
on a special importance which, however, is never purely ontological.
The understanding of being which lies in Da-sein itself expresses itself
pre-ontologically. What is cited in the following document is to make
clear the fact that our existential interpretation is not a mere fabrication,
but as an ontological "construction" it is well grounded and has been
sketched out beforehand in elemental ways.
The following self-interpretation of Da-sein as "care" is preserved
in an old fable:5

198

Cura cum fluvium transiret, videt cretosum lutum sustulitque cog­
itabunda atque coepit fingere. dum deliberat quid iam fecisset.
Jovis interventi. rogat eum Cura ut det spiritum, et facile impe­
trat. cui cum vellet Cura nomen ex sese ipsa imponere, Jovis pro­
hibuit suumque nomen ei dandum esse dictitat. dum Cura etjovis
disceptant, Tellus surrexit simul suumque nomen esse volt cui corpus praebuerit suum. sumpserunt Saturnum iudicem, is sic aecus
iudicat; "tu Jovis quia spiritum dedisti, in morte spiritum, tuque
Tellus, quia dedisti corpus, corpus recipito, Cura enim quia prima
finxit, teneat quamdiu vixerit. sed quae nunc de nomine eius vobis
controversia est, homo vocetur, quia videtur esse factus ex humo."
Once when "care" was crossing a river, she saw some clay; she
thoughtfully took a piece and began to shape it. While she was
thinking about what she had made, jupiter came by. "Care" asked
him to give it spirit, and this he gladly granted. But when she
wanted her name to be bestowed upon it, jupiter forbade this and
demanded that it be given his name instead. While "Care" and
Jupiter were arguing, Earth (Tellus) arose, and desired that her
name be conferred upon the creature, since she had offered it
part of her body. They asked Saturn to be the judge. And Saturn
gave them the following decision, which seemed to be just: "Since
you, Jupiter, have given its spirit, you should receive that spirit at
death; and since you, Earth, have given its body, you shall receive
its body. But since 'Care' first shaped this creature, she shall pos­
sess it as long as it lives. And because there is a dispute among you
as to its name, let it be called 'homo,' for it is made out of humus
(earth)."
This pre-ontological document becomes especially significant not
only in that "care" is here seen as that to which human Da-sein belongs

I.VI

Being and Time

185

"for its lifetime," but also because this priority of "care" emerges in con­
nection with the familiar interpretation of human being as a compound
of body (earth) and spirit. Cura primafinxit. This being has the "origin"
of its being in care. Cura teneat, quamdiu vixerit: this being is not released
from its origin, but retained, dominated by it as long as this being "is in
the world." "Being-in-the-world" has the character of being of "care." It
does not gets its name (homo) with regard to its being, but in relation to
that of which it consists (humus). The decision as to wherein the "pri­
mordial, being of this creature is to be seen is left to Saturn, "time."6 The
pre-ontological characterization of the essence of human being
expressed in this fable thus has envisaged from the very beginning the
mode of being which rules its temporal sojourn in the world.
The history of the signification of the ontic concept of "cura" per­
mits us to see still further fundamental structures of Da-sein. Burdach7
calls our attention to an ambiguity of the term "cura, " according to
which it means not only "anxious effort," but also "carefulness," "dedi­
cation." Thus Seneca writes in his last letter (Ep. 1 24): "Of the four
existing natures (tree, animal, human being, God), the last two, which
alone are endowed with reason, are distinguished in that God is immor­
tal, human being mortal. The good of the One, namely of God, is ful­
filled by its nature; but that of the other, human being, is fulfilled by care
(cura): uniu.s bonum natura perjicit, dei sciliet, alteriu.s cura, hominis."
The peifectio of human being-becoming what one can be in being
free for one's ownmost possibilities (project)-is an "accomplishment" of
"care." But, equiprimordially , care determines the fundamental mode of
this being according to which it is delivered over (thrownness) to the
world taken care of. The "ambiguity" of "care" means a single basic con­
stitution in its essentially twofold structure of thrown project.
As compared with the ontic interpretation, the existential and onto­
logical interpretation is not only a theoretical and antic generalization.
That would only signify that ontically all the human being's behavior is
"full of care" and guided by his "dedication" to something. The "gener­
alization" is an a priori-ontological one. It does not mean ontic qualities
that constantly keep emerging, but a constitution of being which always
already underlies. This constitution first makes it ontologically possible
that this being can be addressed ontically as cura. The existential condi­
tion of the possibility of "the cares of life" and "dedication" must be con­
ceived in a primordial, that is, ontological sense as care.
The transcendental "universality" of the phenomenon of care and
all fundamental existentials has, on the other hand, that broad scope
through which the basis is given on which every antic interpretation of
Da-sein with a worldview moves, whether it understands Da-sein as "the
cares of life" and need, or in an opposite manner.

1 99

200

186

Being and Time

I. VI

The "emptiness" and "generality" of the existential structures
which obtrude themselves ontically have their own ontological definite­
ness and fullness. The whole of the constitution of Da-sein itself is not
simple in its unity, but shows a structural articulation which is expressed
in the existential concept of care.
Our ontological interpretation of Da-sein has brought the pre­
ontological self-interpretation of this being as "care" to the existential
concept of care. The analytic of Da-sein does not aim, however, at an
ontological basis for anthropology; it has a fundamental, ontological
goal. This is the purpose that has inexplicitly determined the course of
our considerations, our choice of phenomena, and the limits to which
our analysis may penetrate. With regard to our leading question of the
meaning of being and its development, our inquiry must now, however,
explicitly secure what has been gained so far. But something like this
cannot be attained by an external synopsis of what has been discussed.
Rather, what could only be roughly indicated at the beginning of the
existential analytic must be sharpened to a more penetrating under­
standing of the problem with the help of what we have gained.
43.

201

Da-sein, Worldliness, and Reality

The question of the meaning of being is possible at all only if some­
thing like an understanding of being is. An understanding of being
belongs to the kind of being of the being which we call Da-sein. The
more appropriately and primordially we have succeeded in explicating
this being, the surer we are to attain our goal in the further course of
working out the problem of fundamental ontology.
While following the tasks of a preparatory existential analytic of
Da-sein, we developed an interpretation of understanding, meaning,
and interpretation. Our analysis of the disclosedness of Da-sein showed
furthermore that, with that disclosedness, Da-sein is revealed equipri­
mordially in accordance with its fundamental constitution of being-in­
the-world with regard to the world, being-in, and the self. Furthermore,
in the factical disclosedness of world, innerworldly beings are also dis­
covered. This means that the being of these beings is always already
understood in a certain way, although not appropriately conceived ontologically. The pre-ontological understanding of being comprehends all
beings which are essentially disclosed in Da-sein, but the understanding
of being itself has not yet gotten articulated according to the various
modes of being.
At the same time, our interpretation of understanding showed
that, in accordance with its entangled kind of being, it has initially and
for the most part transposed itself into an understanding of "world."

I.VI

Being and Time

187

Even when it is not only a matter of ontic experience, but of ontological
understanding, the interpretation of being initially orients itself toward
the being of innerworldly beings.* Here the being of things initially at
hand is passed over and beings are first conceived as a context of things
(res) objectively present. Being acquires the meaning of reality.8 Substan­
tiality becomes the basic characteristic of being. Corresponding to this
diversion in the understanding of being, even the ontological under­
standing of Da-sein moves into the horizon of this concept of being.
Like other beings, Da-sein is also objectively present as real. Thus being in
general acquires the meaning of reality .t Accordingly, the concept of
reality has a peculiar priority in the ontological problematic. This pri­
ority diverts the path to a genuine existential analytic of Da-sein, it also
diverts our view of the being of innerworldly things initially at hand.
Finally, it forces the problematic of being in general into a direction
which lies off course. The other modes of being are defined negatively
and privatively with regard to reality.
Therefore, not only the analytic of Da-sein, but the development of
the question of the meaning of being in general must be wrested from a
one-sided orientation toward being in the sense of reality. We must
demonstrate that reality is not only one kind of being among others, but
stands ontologically in a definite foundational context with Da-sein,
world, and handiness. To demonstrate this, we must discuss in principle
the problem of reality, its conditions and limitations.
Under the heading "the problem of reality" various questions are
clustered: (1) whether the beings which are supposedly "transcendent to
consciousness" are at all; (2) whether this reality of the "external world"
can be sufficiently proved; (3) to what extent this being, if it is real, is to
be known in its being-in-itself; (4) what the meaning of this being, reality,
signifies in general. The following discussion of the problem of reality
treats three things with regard to the question of fundamental ontology:
(a) reality as a problem of being and the demonstrability of the "external
world," (b) reality as an ontological problem, (c) reality and care.

(a) Reality as a Problem of Being and the Demonstrability of the "External
World." Of these questions enumerated about reality, the one which
comes first is the ontological question of what reality signifies in general.
However, as long as a pure ontological problematic and methodology
was lacking, this question (if it was asked explicitly at all) was necessarily

confounded with a discussion of the "problem of the external world";
for the analysis of reality is possible only on the basis of an appropriate
access to what is real. But intuitive cognition has always been viewed as
the way to grasp what is real. Intuitive cognition "is" as a kind of behav­
ior of the soul, of consciousness. Since the character of the in-itself and
independence belongs to reality, the question of the possible indepen­
dence "from consciousness" of what is real, or of the real possible tran­
scendence of consciousness in the "sphere" of what is real, is coupled
with the question of the meaning of reality. The possibility of an ade­
quate ontological analysis of reality depends on how far that .from which
there is independence, what is to be transcended, is itself clarified with
regard to its being. Only in this way can the kind of being that belongs to
transcendence be ontologically grasped. And, finally, the primary kind of
access to what is real must be secured by deciding the question whether
cognition can take over this function at all.
These inquiries which take precedence over any possible ontological
question about reality have been carried out in the foregoing existential
analytic. Accordingly, cognition is a founded mode of access to what is
real. The real is essentially accessible only as innerworldly beings. Every
access to such beings is ontologically based on the fundamental consti­
tution of Da-sein, on being-in-the-world. This has the primordial consti­
tution of being of care (being-ahead-of-itself-already-being-in-a-world-as
being together with innerworldly beings).
The question of whether there is a world at all and whether its
being can be demonstrated, makes no sense at all if it is raised by Da-sein
as being-in-the-world-and who else should ask it? Moreover, it is encumbered with an ambiguity. World as the wherein of being-in, and "world"
as innerworldly beings, that in which one is absorbed in taking care of
things, are confused or else not distinguished at all. But world is essen­
tially disclosed with the being of Da-sein; "world" is always already dis­
covered with the disclosedness of world, too. Of course, innerworldly
beings in the sense of what is real, as merely objectively present, can still
remain covered over. However, what is real, too, is discoverable only on
the basis of a world already disclosed. And only on this basis can what is
real still remain concealed. One asks the question about the "reality" of
the "external world" without previously clarifying the phenomenon of
world as such. Factically, the problem of the external world is constantly
oriented toward innerworldly beings (things and objects). Thus these dis­
cussions drift into a problematic which ontologically can hardly be dis­
entangled.
The entanglement of these questions and the confusion of what
one would like to demonstrate with what is demonstrated and with what
guides the demonstration, is shown in Kant's "Refutation of Idealism. "9

I. VI

Being and Time

189

Kant calls it "a scandal of philosophy and human reason in general"10
that there is still no cogent proof for "the existence of things outside us"
which will do away with any skepticism. He himself proposes such a
proof as the foundation of his "theorem" that "the mere consciousness
of my own existence which, however, is empirically determined, proves
the existence of objects outside of me in space."11
First we must explicitly note that Kant uses the term "existence"
[Dasein] to designate the kind of being which we have called "objective
presence" in our present inquiry. "Consciousness of my existence"
means for Kant consciousness of my objective presence in the sense of
Descartes. The term "existence" means both the objective presence of
consciousness and the objective presence of things.
The proof for the "existence of things outside of me" is supported
by the fact that change and persistence belong equiprimordially to the
nature of time. My objective presence, that is, the objective presence
given in the inner sense of a manifold of representations, is change
objectively present. But the definiteness of time presupposes something
objectively present which persists. This, however, cannot be "in us,"
"because precisely my existence in time can first be determined by this
persisting thing."12 With the objectively present change "in me" which is
posited empirically, an objectively present thing which persists "outside
of me" is also posited. This persisting thing is the condition of the pos­
sibility of the objective presence of change "in me." The experience of
the being-in-time of representations equiprimordially posits changing
things "in me" and persisting things "outside of me."
Of course, this proof is not a causal inference and, accordingly,
not burdened with the prejudices of such proof. Kant gives, so to speak,
an "ontological proof' in terms of the idea of temporal beings. At first, it
appears as if Kant has abandoned the Cartesian position of a prediscov­
ered isolated subject. But that is only illusion. The fact that Kant requires
any proof at all for the "existence of things outside of me" already shows
that he takes the subject, the "in me," as the starting point for this prob­
lematic. The proof itself is then carried out by departing from the empir­
ically given change "in me." For only "in me" is "time" experienced, and
time carries the burden of the proof. It provides the foundation for leap­
ing into the "outside of me" in the course of the proof. Moreover, Kant
emphasizes the fact that "the problematic kind of [Idealism] which . . .
only alleges our inability to prove an existence outside of our own by
immediate experience is reasonable and in accordance with a funda­
mental, philosophical way of thinking; namely, before a sufficient proof
has been found, never to permit a decisive judgment."13
But even if the ontic priority of the isolated subject and of inner
experience were given up, ontologically the position of Descartes would,

204

after all, be retained. What Kant proves-if we admit that his proof and
its basis are correct at all-is that beings that are changing and beings
that are permanent are necessarily present together. But ordering two
objectively present things on the same level does not as yet mean that
subject and object are objectively present together. And even if this
were proved, what is ontologically decisive would still remain covered
over: the fundamental constitution of the "subject," of Da-sein, as being­
in-the-world. The objective presence together of the physical and the psychical is
ontically and ontologically completely different from the phenomenon of being-in­
the-world.
Kant presupposes the difference and the connection of the "in me"
and "outside of me" factically with justification, but in the sense of the
tendency of his proof without justification. It has not been proved that
whatever is decided about the objective presence together of what
changes and what persists when one takes time as a guideline also
applies to the connection between the "in me" and the "outside of me."
But if the whole of the difference and connection of the "inside" and
"outside" presupposed in the proof were seen, if what is presupposed
with this presupposition were ontologically understood, the possibility
for believing that a proof of the "existence of things outside of me" was
still lacking and necessary would collapse.
The "scandal of philosophy" does not consist in the fact that this
proof is still lacking up to now, but in the fact that such prooft are expected
and attempted again and again. Such expectations, intentions, and
demands grow out of an ontologically insufficient way of positing what it
is from which, independently and "outside" of which, a "world" is to be
proven as objectively present. It is not that the proofs are insufficient,
but the kind of being of the being that does the proving and requests
proofs is not definite enough. For this reason the illusion can arise that
with this demonstration of the necessary objective presence together
of two objectively present things something is proved or even demon­
strable about Da-sein as being-in-the-world. Correctly understood, Da­
sein defies such proofs, because it always already is in its being what
the later proofs first deem necessary to demonstrate for it.
If one wanted to conclude from the impossibility of the proofs
for the objective presence of things outside of us that this is thus "merely
to be accepted on faith,"14 the distortion of the problem would not be
overcome. The preconceived opinion would persist that basically and
ideally a proof must be possible. The inappropriate way of approaching
the problem is still endorsed when one confmes oneself to a "faith in the
reality of the external world," even if this faith is explicitly "acknowl­
edged." Although one is not offering a stringent proof, one is still in
principle demanding a proof and trying to satisfy that demand. 15

I. VI

191

Even if one wanted to fall back on the fact that the subject must
presuppose, and indeed always already does unconsciously presuppose,
the fact that the "external world" is objectively present, one would still be
starting with the construct of an isolated subject. The phenomenon of
being-in-the-world would no more be met with than it would be by
demonstrating that the physical and the psychical are objectively present
together. With such presuppositions, Da-sein always already comes "too
late," because, in that it carries out this presupposition as a being (and
otherwise this would not be possible); as a being, it is always already in a
world. "Earlier" than any presupposition that Da-sein makes, or any of its
ways of behavior, there is the "a priori" of its constitution of being in the
mode of being of care.
Faith in the reality of the "external world," whether justified or
not, proves this reality for it, whether sufficiently or insufficiently, it pre­
supposes it, whether explicitly or not, such attempts that have not mas­
tered their own ground with complete transparency, presuppose a sub­
ject which is initially worldless, or not certain of its world, and which
basically must first make certain of a world. Here being-in-the-world is
from the very beginning geared to interpreting, opining, being certain,
and having faith, a kind of behavior which is in itself always already a
founded mode of being-in-the-world.
The "problem of reality" in the sense of the question of whether an
external world is objectively present or demonstrable, turns out to be an
impossible one, not because its consequences led to inextricable
impasses, but because the very being which serves as its theme repudi­
ates such a line of questioning, so to speak. It is not a matter of proving
that and how an "external world" is objectively present, but of demon­
strating why Da-sein as being-in-the-world has the tendency of "initially"
burying the "external world" in nullity "epistemologically" in order first
to prove it. The reason for this lies in the falling prey of Da-sein and in
the diversion motivated therein of the primary understanding of being
to the being of objective presence. If the line of questioning in this
ontological orientation is "critical," it fmds a mere "inner thing" as what
is objectively present and alone certain. After the primordial phe­
nomenon of being-in-the-world has been shattered, the isolated subject
is all that remains, and becomes the basis for being joined together with
a "world."
The multiplicity of attempts at a solution of the "problem of
reality" developed through the various kinds of realism and idealism,
and in the positions which mediate between them, cannot be dis­
cussed in this inquiry at any great length. Just as certainly as a core of
genuine understanding is to be found in all of them, it would be just
as wrong if one wanted to achieve a tenable solution of the problem

206

by calculating what is actually correct. Rather, what is needed is the
basic insight that the various epistemological directions do not so
much go off the track epistemologically, but, that, because they
neglect the existential analytic of Da-sein in general, they do not even
attain the basis for a phenomenally secured problematic. Nor is this
basis to be attained by subsequent phenomenological improvements
of the concept of the subject and consciousness.* Such a procedure
would not guarantee that the inappropriate line of questioning would
not, after all, remain.
With Da-sein as being-in-the-world, innerworldly beings have
already been disclosed. This existential and ontological statement seems
to agree with the thesis of realism that the external world is objectively
present in a real way. Since the objective presence of innerworldly beings
is not denied in this existential statement, it agrees in its result, so to
speak, doxographically, with the thesis of realism. But it is distinguished
in principle from all realism in that realism believes that the reality of the
"world" needs proof, and at the same time is capable of proof. Both
views are directly negated in the existential statement. But what com­
pletely separates it from realism is the lack of ontological comprehension
in realism. Mter all, it tries to explain reality ontically by real connections
of interaction between real things.
As opposed to realism, idealism, no matter how contraryt and
untenable it might be, has a fundamental priority, if it does not misun­
derstand itself as "psychological" idealism. If idealism emphasizes the
fact that being and reality are only "in consciousness," this expresses
the understanding that being cann ot be explained by beings. But to the
extent that it remains unclarified that understanding of being occurs
here and what this understanding of being means ontologically, how it is
possible, and that it belongs to the constitution of being of Da-sein,t
idealism constructs the interpretation of reality in a vacuum. The fact
that being cannot be explained by beings, and reality is only possible in
the understanding of being, does not absolve us from asking about the
being of consciousness, of . the res cogitans itself. If the idealist thesis is to
be followed consistently, the ontological analysis of consciousness is
prescribed as an inevitable prior task. Only because being is "in con­
sciousness," that is, intelligible in Da-sein, can Da-sein also understand
and conceptualize characteristics of being such as independence, "in
itself," reality in general. Only for that reason are "independent" beings
accessible to circumspection as encountered in the world.

If the term idealism amounts to an understanding of the fact that
being is never explicable* by beings, but is always already the "tran­
scendental" for every being, then the sole correct possibility of a philo­
sophical problematic lies in idealism. Then Aristotle was no less of an
idealist than Kant. If idealism means the reduction of all beings to a
subject or a consciousness which are only distinguished by the fact that
they remain

undetermined

in their being and are characterized at best

negatively as "unthinglike," then this idealism is methodologically no
less naive than the grossest realism.
It is still possible that one may give the problematic of reality pri­

ority

over any orientation in terms of "standpoints" by maintaining the

thesis that every subject is what it is only for an object and vice versa. But
with this formal position the terms of the correlation and the correlation
itself remain undetermined ontologically. But at bottom the whole cor­
relation is necessarily thought as "somehow"

existent, thus

thought with

regard to a definite idea of being. Of course, if the existential and onto­
logical basis is secured beforehand with the evidence of being-in-the­
world, this correlation can be known subsequently as a formalized, onto­
logically indifferent relation.
Our discussion of the unexpressed presuppositions of efforts to
solve the problem of reality in ways which are merely "epistemologi­
cal," shows that this problem must be taken back into the existential
analytic of Da-sein as an ontological problem. 16

(b) Reality

as

an Ontological Problem.

If the term realityt refers to the

being ofinnerworldly beings (res) objectively present (and nothing else is

this), that means for the analysis of this mode of being that
innerworldly beings are ontologically to be comprehended only when the

understood by

phenomenon of innerworldliness has been clarified. But innerworldliness
is based on the phenomenon of

world,

which in tum belongs to the fun­

damental constitution of Da-sein as an essential structural factor of being­
in-the-world. Again, being-in-the-world is ontologically bound up with
the structural totality of the being of Da-sein which we characterized as
care. But thus we have characterized the foundations and the horizons
that must be clarified if an analysis of reality is to be possible. In this
connection the character of the in-itself first becomes ontologically intel­
ligible. By taking our orientation toward this context of problems, we
have interpreted the being of innerworldly beings in our earlier analyses.

16

To be sure, within certain limits a phenomenological characteri­
zation of the reality of what is real can already be given without an

explicit existential and ontological basis. Dilthey tried this in the treatise
which we mentioned above. What is real is experienced in impulse and
will. Reality is resistance, more exactly the character of resistance. The
analytic elaboration of the phenomenon of resistance is what is posi­
tive in Dilthey's treatise, and is the best concrete substantiation of his
idea of a "descriptive and analytic psychology." But he is kept from cor­
rectly working out the analysis of the phenomenon of resistance by the
epistemological problematic of reality. The "principle of phenomenality"
does not let Dilthey get to an ontological interpretation of the being of
consciousness. "The will and its inhibition emerge within the same con­
sciousness. "18 What kind of being belongs to "emerging" ? What is the
meaning of the being of the "within" ? What relation of being does con­
sciousness bear to what is real itself? All this needs an ontological deter­
mination. That this was not done can be fmally explained by that fact
that Dilthey left "life" standing in such a way that it is ontologically
undifferentiated, and one cannot go back "behind" life. However, an
ontological interpretation of Da-sein does not mean an antic return to
some other being. The fact that Dilthey was epistemologically refuted
cannot prevent us from making fruitful use of what is positive in his
analyses, which is precisely what has not been understood in these refu­
tations.
Thus recently Scheler took up Dilthey's interpretation of reality.19
He champions a "voluntative theory of Da-sein." Here Da-sein is under­
stood in the Kantian sense as objective presence. The "being of objects
is given immediately only in relation to drive and will." Scheler, like
Dilthey, not only emphasizes the fact that reality is never primarily given
in thinking and grasping, above all he also refers to the fact that knowl­
edge itself is, again, not judgment and that knowing is a "relation of
being."
Fundamentally , what we have already said about the ontological
indefiniteness of Dilthey's foundations is valid for this theory too. Nor
can the fundamental ontological analysis of "life" be inserted afterwards
as a support. It bears and conditions the analysis of reality, the full expli­
cation of resistance and its phenomenal presuppositions. We encounter
resistance in not-getting-through, as an obstacle to wanting-to-get­
through. But with this willing, something must already have been dis­
closed, something which drive and will are out to get. The antic indefi­
niteness of what they are out to get must not, however, be overlooked
ontologically or, for that matter, be understood as if it were nothing.
Being out to get . . . , which comes up against resistance and must "come
up against it," is itself already together with a totality of relevance. But the
discoveredness of that totality is grounded in the disclosedness of the ref­
erential totality of significance. The experience of resistance, that is, the dis-

I.VI

Being and Time

195

covery of resistance in striving, is ontologically possible only on the basis of the
disclosedness of world. Resistance characterizes the being of innerworldly
beings. Experiences of resistance factically determine only the extent
and direction in which beings encountered within the world are discov­
ered. Their sum does not first introduce the disclosure of world, but pre­
supposes it. The "against" and the "counter to" are supported in their
ontological possibility by disclosed being-in-the-world.
Nor is resistance experienced in a drive or a will "emerging" in its
own right. These tum out to be modifications of care. Only beings with
this kind of being are able to run up against something resistant in the
world. Thus, if reality is defined by resistance, we must consider two
things. On the one hand, we have only gotten at one characteristic of
reality among others, and on the other hand the already disclosed world
is necessarily presupposed for resistance. Resistance characterizes the
"external world" in the sense of innerworldly beings, but never in the
sense of world. "Consciousness of reality" is itself a way of being-in-the-world.
Every "problematic of the external world" necessarily goes back to this
basic existential phenomenon.
If the "cogito sum" is to serve as the point of departure for the exis­
tential analytic, we need not only to tum it around, but we need a new
ontological and phenomenal confirmation of its content. Then the first
statement is "sum," in the sense of l-am-in-a-world. As such a being, "I
am" in the possibility of being toward various modes of behavior (cogi­
tationes) as ways of being together with innerworldly beings. In contrast,
Descartes says that cogitationes are indeed objectively present and an
ego is also objectively present as a worldless res cogitans.
(c) Reality and Care. As an ontological term, reality is related to inner­
worldly beings. If it serves to designate this kind of being in general, then
handiness and objective presence function as modes of reality. But if one
lets this word keep its traditional* meaning, it means being in the sense of
the pure, objective presence of things. But not all objective presence is the
objective presence of things. "Nature," which "surrounds" us, is indeed an
innerworldly being, but it shows neither the kind of being of handiness
nor of objective presence as "natural things." However one interprets
this being of "nature," all modes of being of innerworldly beings are onto­
logically founded in the worldliness of the world, and thus in the phe­
nomenon of being-in-the-world. From this there arises the insight that
neither does reality have priority within the modes of being of inner­
worldly beings nor can this mode of being even characterize something
like world and Da-sein in an ontologically adequate way.
*Prevalent today.

21 1

196

212

Being and Time

I.VI

Reality is referred back to the phenomenon of care in the order of onto­
logical foundational contexts and possible categorial and existential
demonstration. The fact that reality is ontologically grounded in the
being of Da-sein cannot mean that something real can only be what it is
in itself when and as long as Da-sein exists.
However, only as long as Da-sein is, that is, as long as there is the
ontic possibility of an understanding of being, "is there" [gibt es] being. If
Da-sein does not exist, then there "is" no "independence" either, nor "is"
there an "in itself." Such matters are then neither comprehensible nor
incomprehensible. Innerworldly beings, too, can neither be discovered,
nor can they lie in concealment. Then it can neither be said that beings
are, nor that they are not. Now, as long as there is an understanding of
being and thus an understanding of objective presence, we can say that
then beings will still continue to be.
As we have noted, being (not beings) is dependent upon the
understanding of being, that is, reality (not the real) is dependent upon
care. This dependency protects our further analytic of Da-sein from an
uncritical interpretation of Da-sein constantly obtruding itself-an inter­
pretation that follows the guideline of the idea of reality. Only the ori­
entation toward existentiality as interpreted in an ontologically positive
way guarantees that in the factical course of the analysis of "conscious­
ness," of "life," some meaning of reality is not made basic, even if it is
one that has not been further differentiated.
The fact that beings having the kind of being of Da-sein cannot be
comprehended in terms of reality and substantiality has been expressed
by the thesis that the substance of human being is existence. Interpreting
existentiality as care and distinguishing it from reality do not, however,
signal the end of the existential analytic, but only lets the maze of prob­
lems in the question of being and its possible modes, and the meaning
of such modifications, emerge more sharply. Only if an understanding
of being is, are beings accessible as beings; only if beings of the kind of
being of Da-sein are, is an understanding of being possible as beings
[Seinsverstiindnis als Seiendes].

Da-sein, Disclosedness, and Truth

From time immemorial, philosophy has associated* truth with being.
The first discovery of the being of beings by Parmenides "identifies"
being with the perceptive understanding of being: to gar auto noein estin
te kai einai.20 Aristotle emphasizes in his sketch of the history of the
discovery of archai21 the fact that the philosophers before him were led

by "the things thems elves" to ques tion further: auto to pragma
hiidopoiesen autois kai sunenagka.se zetein.22 He also characterizes the same
fact with the words: anagkazomenos d 'akolouthein tois phainomenois/� he
(Pannenides) was compelled to follow what showed itself in itself. In
another passage he says: hup ' autes tes aletheia.s anagkazomenoi,24 com­
pelled by "truth" itself, they inquired. Aristotle designates this inquiry as
philosophein peri tes aletheia.s,25 philosophizing" about the "truth" or even
as apophainesthia peri tes aletheia.s,26 as demonstrating something and
letting it be seen with regard to the "truth" and in the scope of "truth."
Philosophy itself is defined as episteme tis tes aletheia.s/7 the science of
"truth." But at the same time it is characterized as an episteme, he theiJrei
to on he on/8 as the science that considers beings as beings, that is, with
regard to their being.
What does "inquiring into 'truth'" mean here, the science of
"truth"? Is "truth" made thematic in this inquiry in the sense of a theory
of knowledge or of judgment? Obviously not, for "truth" means the
s ame thing as "matter" ["Sache"], "what shows itself." But then what
does the expression "truth" mean if it can be used as a tenn for "beings"
and "being"?
But if truth rightfully has a primordial connection with being, the
phenomenon of truth moves into the scope* of the problematic of fun­
damental ontology. But must not this phenomenon have been encoun­
tered already within our preparatory fundamental analysis, the analytic
of Da-sein? What antic-ontological connection does "truth" have with Da­
sein and with its antic characteristic which we call the understanding of
being? Can the reason why being necessarily goes together with truth
and vice versa be pointed out in tenns of this understanding?
These questions cannot be avoided. Because being actually "goes
together" with truth, the phenomenon of truth has already been one of
the themes of our earlier analysis, although not explicitly under this
name. Now we must explicitly delimit the phenomenon of truth giving
precision to the problem of being and fixing the problems contained
therein. In doing this, we shall not simply summarize what we have said
previously. The investigation takes a new point of departure.t
Our analysis starts from (a) the traditional concept of truth and
attempts to lay bare its ontological foundations. In tenns of these foun­
dations the primordial phenomenon of truth becomes visible. On the
basis of this, (b) the derivativeness of the traditional concept of truth can
be indicated. Our investigation makes clear that the question of the
kind of being of truth also necessarily belongs to the question of the

truth.
Three

theses characterize the traditional interpretation of the essence of truth
and the way it is supposed to have been first defined:

1.

The "locus" of truth is the proposition (judgment).

2. The essence of truth lies in the "agreement" of the judgment with its
object.

3.

Aristotle, the father of logic, attributed truth to judgment as its pri­
mordial locus, he also started the definition of truth as "agreement."
A history of the concept of truth, which could only be presented

on the basis of a history of ontology, is not intended here. A few char­
acteristic references to familiar matters may serve to introduce our ana­
lytical discussions .
Aristotle says: pathemata

tes psyches ton pragmaton homoiomata/9 the
noemata ( "representations"} , are corre­

" experiences" of the soul, the
spondences

[Angleichungen]

to things. This assertion, which is by no

means presented as an explicit essential definition of truth, also became
the occasion for the development of the later formulation of the essence
of truth as

adaequatio intellectus et rei. Thomas Aquinas,30 who refers

this

definition to Avicenna (who adopted it, in turn, from Isaak Israeli's

Book of Definitions

[tenth century] }, als o uses the terms

( correspondence) and

convenentia

adaequatio

( coming together) for

(agreement) .

21 5

The neo-Kantian epis temology of the nineteenth century frequently characterized this definition of truth as an expression of a
methodologically retarded naive realism, and declared it to be incom­
mensurable with any line of questioning which had gone through Kant's
"Copernican revolution." But Kant, too, retained this concept of truth,
so much so that he did not even start to discuss it. This has been over­
looked, though Brentano had already call e d our attention to it. "The old
and celebrated ques tion with which it was supposed that one might
drive the logicians into a corner is this: 'what is truth?' The explanation
of the name of truth-namely, that it is the agreement of knowledge

with its obj ect-will be here granted and presupposed. "!1

"If truth consists in the agreement of knowledge with its object,
then this object must be distinguished from others; for knowledge is
false if it does not agree with the obj ect to which it is related, even if it
should contain something which might well be valid for other objects . " 32

And in the introduction to the transcendental dialectic Kant says: "Truth
and illusion are not in the object so far as it is intuited, but in the judg­
ment about it so far as it is thought. ""
Of course the characterization of truth as "agreement, "

tio, homoiosis,

is very general and empty. But it will still have s ome justi­

fication if it can hold its own without prejudice to any of the most varied
interpretations this distinctive predicate "knowledge" will support. We
now ask about the foundations of this "relation. "

et rei?

What does the term "agreement" mean in general? The agree­
ment of something with something has the formal character of the rela­
tion of something to something. Every agreement, and thus "truth" as
well, is a relation. But not every relation is an agreement. A sign points
to what is shown. Showing is a relation, but not an agreement between
the sign and what is shown. But obviously every agreement does not
mean something like the

convenentia laid down in the definition of truth.

The number 6 agrees with 16 minus 10. These numbers agree; they are
equal with regard to the question of how much. Equality is

one kind

of

agreement. Structurally, something like a "with regard to" belongs to it.
What is that with regard to which what is related in the

adequatio agrees?

In clarifying the "truth relation" we must notice also what is peculiar to
the terms of this relation. With regard to what do

intellectus

and

res

agree? In their kind of being and essential content do they supply anything at all with regard to which they can agree? If it is impossible for

intellectus

and

res

to be equal because they are not of the same species,

are they then perhaps similar? But knowledge is supposed to "give" the
matter just as it is. "Agreement has the relational character of ·�ust-as." In
what way is this relation possible, as a relation between

intellectus and res?

From these questions it becomes clear that it is not sufficient for the clar­
ification of the structure of truth simply to presuppose this relational
totality, but we must rather ask about the context of being which supports this totality as such.
Do we need for this purpose to unfold the "epistemological" prob­
lematic with regard to the subject-object relation, or can our analysis be
limited to an interpretation of the "immanent consciousness of truth, "
thus remaining "within the sphere" of the subj ect? According to general
opinion, what is true is knowledge. But knowledge is judging. In judging,
one must distinguish between judging as a real psychical procedure and
what is judged as an

ideal

content. It is of the latter that we say it is

"true." In contrast, the real psychical procedure is either objectively pre­
sent or not. Accordingly, the ideal content ofjudgment stands in a rela­
tion of agreement. Thus this relation pertains to a connection between

an

216

ideal content of judgment and the real thing as that

about

which one

judges . Is agreement real or ideal in its kind of being, or neither of the
two? Haw is

the relation between an ideal being and a real thing objectively pre­
sent to be grasped ontologicaUy? It does, after all , subsist and it: subsists in fac­

ti cal judging not only between the content of judgment and the real
object, but rather at the same time between the ideal content and the real
act ofjudgment, and here obviously even more "intimately"?
Or are we not all owed to ask about the ontological meaning of
the relation between the real and the ideal

Why should this not be a legitimate question? Is it a matter of chance

217

that this problem has not made any headway for more than tw o thou­
sand years? Does the distortion of the question already lie

in the begin­

ning, in the ontologically unclarified separation of the real and the ideal?
And is it not the separation of the real act and the ideal content
thoroughly illegitimate with regard to the "actual" judging of what is
judged? Is not the reality of knowing and judging sundered into two
kinds of being, two "levels" that can never be pieced together so as to get
at the kind of being of knowing? Is not psychologism correct in rejecting

this separation even if it neither clarifies ontologically the kind of being
that belongs to the thinking of what is thought, nor is even familiar
with it as a problem?
If we go back to the separation between the act ofjudgment and its
content, we shall not further our dis cussion of the kind of being that
b elongs to the

adequatio,

but only make plain the indispensability of

clarifying the kind of being of knowing itself. The analysis necessary
for this must attempt to bring to view the phenomenon of the truth
that characterizes knowledge. When does truth become phenomenally
explicit in knowing itself? When knowing proves to be true. By demon­
s trating itself, it is assured of its truth. Thus the relation of agreement
must become visible in the phenomenal connection of demonstration.
Let someone make the true statement with his back to the wall :
"The picture on the wall is hanging crookedly." This statement demon­
strates itself when the speaker turns around and perceives the picture
hanging crookedly on the wall. What is proved in this demonstration?
What is the meaning of confirming this statement? Do we perhaps ascer­
tain an agreement between "knowledge" or "what is known" with the
thing on the wall ? Yes and no, depending on whether our interpreta­
tion of the expression "what is known" is phenomenally adequate. To
what is the speaker related when he judges without perceiving the pic­
ture, but "only representing" it? Possibly to "representations"? Certainly
not, if representation is supposed to mean here representing as a psy­
chical event. Nor is he related to representations in the sense of what is

itself. And what is demonstrated by perception? Nothing other than the
fact

that

is

this very being that one has in mind in one's statement.

This is further confirmed by the fact that this is pointed out by the being
in which the statement is made-which is being toward what is put forward in the statement. What is to be confirmed is

that

the

being toward which it is. What is demonstrated is the discovering being of
the assertion. Here knowing remains related solely to the being itself in
the act of demonstration. It is in this being, so to speak, that the confir­
mation takes place. The being that one has in mind shows itself os it is in
itself, that is, it shows that it, in its selfsameness, is just as

it

is discov-

ered or pointed out in the assertion. Representations are not compared,
neither among themselves nor in

relation to

the real thing. What is to be

demonstrated is not an agreement of knowing with its obj ect, still less
s omething psychical with something physical, but neither is it an agreement between the "contents of consciousness" among themselves. What

is to be demonstrated is solely the bein g-discovered of the being itself,

that being in the how of its being discovered. 'Ibis is

that what is stated (that is, the being itself) shows itself os

discovering being toward real beings in its ontological meaning.
To say that a statement is true means that it discovers the beings in
themselves. It asserts, it shows, it lets beings "be seen" (apophansis) in
their discoveredness . The being true (truth) of the statement must be
understood as discovering. Thus, truth by no means has the structure of
a

an agreement between knowing and the obj ect in the sense of a correspondence o f one being (subject) to another (object).
Being-true as discovering is in tum ontologically possible only on
the basis of being-in-the-world. This phenomenon, in which we recog­
nized a basic constitution of Da-sein, is the

foundation of the primordial

phenomenon of truth. This is now to be followed up in a more pene­
trating manner.

Traditional Concept of Truth. Being-true (truth) means to-be-discovering.

But is that not a highly arbitrary definition of truth? With such drastic
definitions of the concept we might succeed in eliminating the idea of
agreement from the concept of truth. Must we not pay for this dubious
gain by letting the "good" old tradition fall into nothingness? However,
this seemingly

arbitrary definition

contains only the

necessary

interpreta­

tion of what the oldest tradition of ancient philosophy primordially sur­
mised and even understood in a pre-phenomenological way. The being­
true of the

logos as apophansis is aletheuein in the manner of apophainesthai:

to let beings be seen in their unconcealment ( discoveredness ) , taking
them out of their concealment. The

aletheia which is

equated by Aristotle

in the passages cited above signifies the

" things themselves," that which shows itself, beings in the how of their dis­
coveredness . And is it a coincidence that in one of the fragments of Hera­
clitusg5-the oldest fragments of philosophical doctrine which explicitly
treat the logos-the phenomenon of truth in the sense of discoveredness
(unconcealment), as we have set it forth, shows through? Those who do

logos and understands it. The logos is phrazfm hokOs echei, it tells how beings

(epilanthanontai), that is,
aletheia,

for them it sinks back into concealment. Thus unconcealment,
b elongs to the

logos.

To translate this word as "truth, " and especially to

define this expression conceptually in theoretical ways, is to cover over
the meaning of what the Greeks posited at the basis-as "self-evident"
and as pre-philosophical-of the tenninological use of aletheia.

220

In citing such evidence we must guard against uninhibited wordmysticism. Still, in the end it is the business of philosophy to protect
the

power of the most elemental words

in which Da-sein expresses itself

from b eing flattened by the common unders tanding to the point of
unintelligibility, which in its turn functions as a s ource for illusory
problems .
What we presented earlier,� so to speak in a dogmatic interpreta­
tion, about

logos

and

aletheia

has now gained its phenomenal demon­

stration. The " definition" of truth presented does not shake off the tra­
dition, but is rather its primordial

appropriation;

and this will be even

more the case if we succeed in demonstrating whether and how the
theory had to arrive at the idea of agreement on the basis of the pri­
mordial phenomenon of truth.
Nor is the "definition" of truth as disclosedness and disclosing a
mere explanation of words, but grows out of the analysis of the relations
of Da-sein which we are initially accustomed to call "true."
Being true as discovering is a manner of being of Da-sein. What
makes this discovering itself possible must necessarily be call ed "true" in

a s till more primordial sense;

Discovering is a way of being of being-in-the-world. Taking care of
things, whether in circumspection or in looking in a leisurely way, dis­
covers innerworldly beings. The latter become what is discovered. They
are " true" in a secondary sense. Primarily "true, " that is, discovering, is
Da-sein. Truth in the secondary sense does not mean to be discovering
( discovery), but to be discovered (discoveredness).
But we showed in our earlier analysis of the worldliness of the
world and innerworldly beings that the discoveredness of innerworldly
b eings is

grounded

in the disclosedness of the world. However, dis­

closedness is the basic character of Da-sein in accordance with which it

is

its there. Disclosedness is constituted by attunement, understanding,
and discourse, and pertains equiprimordially to the world, being-in, and
the self. The structure of care as being ahead tif-itself already-being-in-a­

closedness of Da-sein.

truth attained. What was shown earlier with regard to the existential
constitution of the there'7 and in relation to the everyday being of the
there'8 pertains to nothing other than the most primordial phenomenon
of truth. In that Da-sein essentially

is its

disclosedness, and, as disclosed,

discloses and discovers, it is essentially "true. " Da-sein

is "in the truth."

This s tatement has an ontological meaning. It does not mean that Dasein is ontically always or at times introduced to "all truth," but that the
disclosedness of its owmnost being belongs to its existential constitution.
By considering what we have gained so far, the full existential
meaning of the statement "Da-sein is in the truth" can be summarized by
the following considerations:

1. Disclosedness in general belongs

essentially to the constitution of

being of Da-sein. It comprehends the totality of the structure of being
that has become explicit through the phenomenon of care . To care
b elongs not only being-in-the-world, but being together with inner­
worldly beings. The being of Da-sein and its disclosedness belong equi­
primordially to the discoveredness of innerworldly beings.

2. Thrownness

belongs to the constitution of being of Da-sein as a

constituent of its disclosedness . In thrownness the fact is revealed that
Da-sein, as my Da-sein and this Da-sein, is always already in a definite
world and together with a definite range of definite innerworldly beings.
Disclosedness is essentially factical .

3. Project belongs

to the constitution of being of Da-sein: disclosive

being toward its own potentiality-of-being. Da-sein

204

else in terms of its ownmost potentiality-of-being. This possibility means
that Da-sein discloses itself to itself in and as its ownmost potentiality-of­
being. This

authentic disclosedness shows the phenomenon of the most pri­

mordial truth in the mode of authenticity. The most primordial and
authentic disclosedness in which Da-sein can be as a potentiality-of-being
is the

truth of existence. Only in the context of an analysis of the authentic­

ity of Da-sein does it receive its existential, ontological definiteness.

222

4. Falling prey belongs to the constitution of being of Da-sein. Ini·
tially and for the most part, Da-sein is lost in its "world. " As a project
upon possibilities of being, understanding has diverted itself there.
Absorbing oneself in the they signifies that it is dominated by public
interpretedness. What is discovered and disclosed stands in the mode

in

which it has been disguised and closed off by idle talk, curiosity, and
ambiguity. Being toward beings has not been extinguished but uprooted.
Beings are not completely concealed, but precisely discovered, and at
the same time distorted. They show themselves, but in the mode of illu­
sion. Similarly, what was previously discovered sinks back again into

used here ontologically, as is the expression "falling prey." Any onti­
cally negative "value judgment" is to be avoided in its existential and ana­
lytical use. Being closed off and covered over belong to the

facticity

of

Da-sein. The full existential and ontological meaning of the statement
"Da-sein is in the truth" also says equiprimordially that "Da-sein is in
untruth. " But only insofar as Da-sein is disclosed, is it also closed off, and
insofar as innerworldly beings are always already discovered with Da­
sein, are such b eings covered over (hidden) or disguised as possible
innerworldly beings to be encountered.
Thus, Da-sein must explicitly and essentiall y appropriate what has
also already been discovered, defend it

against

illusion and distortion,

and ensure itself of its discoveredness again and again. All new discovery
takes place not on the basis of complete concealment, but takes its point
of departure from discoveredness in the mode of illusion. Beings look
like . . . , that is, they are in a way already discovered, and yet they are
still distorted.
Truth, (discoveredness) must always first be wrested from beings.
Beings are tom from concealment. The actual factical discoveredness is,
so to speak, always a kind of

robbery.

Is it a matter of chance that the

Greeks express themselves about the essence of truth with a
expression

The fact that the goddess of truth who leads Parmenides places
him before two paths, that of discovering and that of concealment, sig­
nifies nothing other than the fact that Da-sein is always already both in
the truth and the untruth. The path of discovering is gained only in

223

in distinguishing between them understandingly and in

deciding for the one rather than the other.�9
The existential and ontological condition for the fact that being-in­
the-world is determined by "truth" and "untruth" lies in
tion of being of Da-sein* which we characterized as

the constitu­
throum project. It is a

constituent of the structure of care.
The exi s te n tial and ontologi cal interpre tation of the p he­
nomenon of truth has shown: (1) Truth in the most primordial sense is
the disclosedness of Da-sein to which belongs the discoveredness of
innerworldly beings.

( 2 ) Da-sein is equiprimordially in truth and

untruth.
Within the horizon of the traditional interpretation of the phe­
nomenon of truth our insight into these statements will not be com­
pletet until it can be shown:

being of disclosedness itself leads to the fact that initially its derivative
modification comes into view and guides the theoretical explication of
the structure of truth.
Statement and its structure, the apophantical "as," are based on
interpretation and its structure, the hermeneutical "as," and further­
more on understanding, on the disclosedness of Da-sein. But here truth
is regarded as an eminent determination of statements thus derived.
Accordingly, the roots of the truth of statement reach back to the dis­
closedness of understanding.4° But now the phenomenon of

their discoveredness. Da-sein, perceiving the communication, brings
itself to a discovering being toward the beings discussed. The statements
made are made about something, and in what they are about they contain the discoveredness of beings . This discoveredness is preserved in
what is expressed. What is expressed becomes, so to speak, an inner* Of Da-sein and thus of standing·in [Irutandigkeit] .

worldly thing at hand that can be taken up and spoken about further.
Because the discoveredness has been presenred, what is expressed (what
is thus at hand) has in itself a relation to any beings about which it is a
statement. Discoveredness is always a discoveredness of . . . . Even when
Da-sein repeats what has been said, it comes into a being toward the very
beings that have been discussed. But it is and believes itself exempt
from a primordial repetition of the act of discovering.
Da-sein does not need to bring itself to beings in " original" expe­
rience, but it nevertheless remains in a being toward these beings . Dis­
coveredness is appropriated to a large extent not by one's own discov­
ering, but by hearsay of what has been said. Absorption in what has
been said belongs to the kind of being of the they. What is expressed as
such takes over the being toward these beings discovered in the state­
ment. But if they are to be explici tly appropriated with regard to their
discoveredness, this means that the s tatement is to be demonstrated as
one that discovers. But the statement expressed is something at hand, in
such a way that, preserving discoveredness, it has in itself a relation to
the beings discovered. To demonstrate that it is something that discov­
ers, means to demonstrate how the statement that presetves discov­
eredness is related

to

these beings. The statement is something at hand.

The beings to which it has a discovering relation are innerworldly things
at hand or objectively present. Thus the relation presents itself as some­
thing objectively present. But this relation lies in the fact that the dis­
coveredness presenred in the statement is always a discoverednes s
of . . . . The judgment "contains something valid for the objects" ( Kant).
But the relation itself now acquires the character of objective presence
by getting switched over to a relation between objectively present things.
Discoveredness of . . . becomes the objectively present conformity of
something objectively present, of the statement expressed,

to something

obj ectively present, the being spoken about. And if this conformity is
then viewed only as the relation between objectively present things, that
is, if the kind of being of the terms of the relation is understood without
differentiation as merely objectively present things, then the relation
shows itself as the obj ectively present conformity of two objectively pre­
s ent things .

225

When the statement has been expressed, the discoveredness of beings moves
into the kind of being of inneroJorldly things at hand. But to the extent that in
this discoveredness, as a discoveredness of . . . , a relation to things objectively
present persists, discoveredness (truth) in its turn becomes an objectively present
relation between objectively present things (intellectus et res).
The existential phenomenon of discoveredness based on the dis­
closedness of Da-sein becomes an obj ectively present property that still
contains the character of relation and, as such, is split up into an objec-

I. VI

Being and Time

207

tively present relation. Truth as disclosedness and as a being toward
discovered beings-a being that itself discovers-has become truth as the
agreement b e tween innerworldly things objectively present. Thus we
have shown the ontological derivation of the traditional concept of
truth.
However, what comes last in the order of the existential and onto­
logical foundational context is regarded ontically and factically as what is
firs t and nearest. But the necessity of this fact is again based in the kind
of being of Da-sein itself. Absorbed in taking care of things, Da-sein
understands itself in terms of what it encounters within the world. The
discoveredness belonging to discovering is initially found within the
world in what has been

express ed.

But not only is truth encountered as

something objectively present, but the understanding of being in general
initially understands all beings as something objectively present. If the
"truth" that we encounter initially in an antic way is understood onto­
logically

in the way nearest to us, the logos (statement) gets understood as

logos tinos

(statement about . . . , discoveredness of . . . ), but the phe­

nomenon gets interpreted as something objectively present with regard
to its possible objective presence. But becaus e obj ective presence is
equated with the meaning of being in general, the question whether
this kind of being of truth, and its initially encountered structure, are pri­

can not arise at all. The understanding of being of Da-sein
which was initially dominant, and has still not been overcome today in a fun­
damental and explicit way, itself covers over the primordial phenomenon of

mordial or not

At the s ame time, we must not overlook the fact that for the
Greeks, who were the first to develop this initial understanding of being
as a branch of knowledge and to bring it to dominance, this primordial
understanding of truth was also alive, even if pre-ontologically , and it
even held its own against the concealment implicit in their ontology-at
leas t in Aristotle.42
Aristode never defended the thesis that the primordial "place" of

logos is the kind of being
of Da-sein which can either discover or cover over. This double possibility
is what is distinctive about the truth of the logos; it is the attitude which
can also cover over. And since Aristode never asserted this thesis, he was
never in the p osition of "expanding" the concept of truth of logos to
pure noein. The "truth" of aesthesis and of the seeing of the "Ideas," is the
primordial discovering. And only because noesis primarily discovers, can
the logos, too, have the function of discovering as dianoein.

only invokes Aristotle unjustly, it also fails with regard to i ts content to

2 08

Being and Time

"locus" of truth, but the

I.VJ

other way around,

the s tatement as a mode of

appropriation of discoveredness and as a way of being-in-the-world is
based in discovering, or in the

disclosedness

of Da-sein. The most pri­

mordial " truth" is the "locus" of the statement and the ontological con­
dition of the possibility that statements can be true or false (discovering
or covering over).
Understood in its most primordial sense, truth belongs to the fun­
damental constitution of Da-sein. The term signifies an existential. But
thus we have already sketched out our answer to the question of the
kind of being of truth and the meaning of the necessity of the presup­
position

that " there is truth."

(c) The Kind ofBeing of Truth and the Presupposition of Truth.

Constituted

by disclosedness, Da-sein is essentially in the truth. Disclosedness is an
essential kind of being of Da-sein. "There is" ["gibt es" ] truth only insofar as
Da-sein is and as long as it is. Beings are discovered only when Da-sein is,
and only as long as Da-sein is are they disclosed. Newton's laws, the law of
contradiction, and any truth whatsoever, are true only as long as Da-sein

is. Before there was any Da-sein, there was no truth;

nor will there be any

after Da-sein is no more. For in such a case truth as disclosedness, dis­
covering, and discoveredness

cannot be.

Before Newton's laws were dis­

covered, they were not "true." From this it does not follow that they
were false or even that they would become false if ontically no discov-

227

eredness were possible any longer. Just as little does this "restriction"
imply a diminution of the being true of " truths . "
The fact that before Newton his laws were neither true nor fals e
cannot mean that th e beings which they point o u t i n a discovering way
did not previously exist. The laws became true through Newton, through
them beings in themselves became accessible for Da-sein. With the dis­
coveredness of beings, they show themselves precisely as the beings that
previously were. To discover in this way is the kind of being of " truth . "
T h e fact that there are " eternal truths " will n o t be adequately
proven until it is successfully demonstrated that Da-sein has been and
will be for all eternity. As long as this proof is lacking, the s tatement
remains a fantasical assertion which does not gain in legitimacy by being
generally "believed" by the philosophers.

In accordance with the essential kind of being appropriate to Da-sein,
all truth is relative to the being ofDa-sein. Is this relativity tantamount to say­
ing that all truth is " subjective"? If one interprets "subjective" to mean
"left to the arbitrariness of the subject, " then certainly not. For in accor­
dance with its very meaning, discovering exempts statements from the
province of "subjective" arbitrariness and brings discovering Da-sein
before beings themselves. And only because "truth," as discovering,

is a

I.VI

Being and Time

kind of being of Da-sein,

209

can it be removed from the arbitrariness of Da­

sein. The "universal validity" of truth, too, is rooted solely in the fact that
Da-sein can discover and free beings in themselves . Only thus can this
being in itself be binding for every possible statement, that is, for every
possible way of pointing them out. If truth has been correctly under­
stood, is it not in the least j eopardized by the fact that it is ontically
possible only in the "subject," and stands or falls with the being of that
" subject"?
The meaning of the presupposition of truth, too, becomes intelli­
gible in terms of the existentially conceived kind of being of truth.

must we presuppose that there is truth?

Why

What does " presuppose" mean?

What do "must" and "we" mean? What does it mean " there is truth"?
"We" presupposes truth because, "we," existing in the kind of being of
Da-sein,

are "in the truth."

We do not presuppose it as something "out­

side" and "above" us to which we are related along with other "values"

truth makes it ontologically posbe in such a way that we "presuppose" something.
Truth first makes possible something like presupposition.
too. We do not presuppose truth, but*

sible that we can

What does "presupposing" mean? To understand something as the
ground of the being of another being. Such understanding of a being in
its context of being is possible only on the basis of disdosedness, that is,
the discovering of Da-sein. To presuppose "truth" then means to under­
stand it as something for the sake of which Da-sein is. But Da-sein is
always already ahead of itself; that lies in its constitution of being as care.
It is a being that is concerned in its being about its ownmost potentiality­
of-being. Disdosedness and discovering belong essentially to the being
and potentiality-for-being of Da-sein as being-in-the-world. Da-sein is con­
cerned with its potentiality-for-being-in-the-world, and this includes cir­
cumspectly discovering and taking care of innerworldly beings. In the
constitution of being of Da-sein as care, in being ahead of itself, lies the

Because this presupposing itself belongs to
the being of Da-sein, "we" have to also presuppose "ourselves" as determined by

related to beings unlike Da-sein, which are there in addition, but solely to
itself. The truth which is presupposed, or which "is there, " by which its
being is to be defined, has the kind of being, or meaning of being, of Da­
sein itself. We have to "make" the presupposition of truth because it

is

already " made" with the being of the "we."

Da-sein. This belongs to the essential thrownness of Da-sein into the
world.

Has Da-sein as itself everfreely decided and will it euer be able to decide
whether it wants to come into "Da·sein" or not? "In itself' we cannot see
why beings should be discovered, why truth and Da-sein must be. The
usual refutation of scepticism, that denies either the being or the knowa­
bility of "truth," gets stuck halfway. What it shows in formal argumen­
tation is simply the fact that when someone judges, truth has been pre­
supposed: this suggests that "truth" belongs to statements, that pointing
out is a discovering according to its meaning.
gets

clarified,

Why

that must be never

it has never been clarified wherein the ontological ground

for this necessary connection of being of statement and truth lies. Simi­
larly, the kind of being of truth and the meaning of presupposing and its
ontological foundation in Da-sein itself remain completely obscure.

229

Moreover, one fails to recognize the fact that truth is already presup­
posed even when no one is judging, insofar as Da-sein is at all.

A skeptic can no more be refuted than the being of truth can ever
be "proved." If the skeptic, who denies the truth, factically is, he does

even need

to be refuted. Insofar as he

is

not

and has understood himself in

this being, he has obliterated Da-sein, and thus truth, in the despair of
suicide. The necessity of truth cannot be proven because Da-sein cannot
first be subjected to proof for its own part. It has no more been demon­
strated that there has ever "been" a "real" skeptic (although that is what

has at bottom been believed in the refutations of skepticism, in spite of
what these undertake to do) than it has been demonstrated that there
are any "eternal truths." Perhaps such skeptics have been more frequent
than one would innocently like to believe when one tries to overturn
"skepticism" by formal dialectics.
Thus with the question of the being of truth and the necessity of its
presupposition as well as that of the essence of knowledge,

an

"ideal sub­

ject" has generally been posited. The explicit or inexplicit motive for this
lies in the requirement that philosophy should have the

"a prion'"

as its

theme, rather than "empirical facts" as such. There is some justification for

this requirement, though it still needs to be grounded ontologically. But is
this requirement satisfied by positing an "ideal subject"? Is it not a fantas­

tically idealized subject?

Is not precisely the

a priori character of the merely

"factual" subject, of Da-sein, missed with the concept of such a subject? Is
it not an attribute of the a priori character of the factical subject (that is, of
the facticity of Da-sein) that it is equiprimordially in truth and untruth?
The ideas of a "pure ego" and
far from including the

a priori

a

"consciousness in general" are so

character of "real" subjectivity that they

pass over the ontological character of facticity of Da-sein and its consti­
tution of being, or do not see it at all. Rejection of a "consciousness in
general" does not mean the negation of the

a priori,

any more than the

Being and Time

I. VI

positing of an idealized subject guarantees a factually based

a

211

priori

character of Da-sein.
The contention that there are "eternal truths," as well as the con­
fusion of the phenomenally based "ideality" of Da-sein with an ideal­
ized absolute subject, belong to the remnants of Christian theology
within the philosophical problematic that have not yet been radically
eliminated.
The being of truth stands in a primordial connection with Da-sein.
And only because Da-sein exists as constituted by disclosedness (that is,
by understanding) can something like being be understood, only so is an
understanding of being possible at all.
"There is"[.& gibt] being-not beings-only insofar as truth is. And
truth

is

only because and as long as Da-sein is. Being and truth "are"

equiprimordially. What does it mean that being "is," where being is,
after all, supposed to be distinguished from all beings?* One can inquire
into this only when the meaning of being and the scope of the under­
standing of being in general have been clarified. Only then can one
also analyze primordially what belongs to the concept of a science of

being as such,

its possibilities and transformations. And in the definition

of this inquiry and its truth, the inquiry will have to be ontologically
defined as the discovery of

beings and their truth.

The answer to the question of the meaning of being is still lacking.
What has the fundamental analysis of Da-sein so far accomplished for
the development of that question? By freeing the phenomenon of care,
we clarified the constitution of being of that being to whose being some­
thing like an understanding of being belongs. The being of Da-sein was
thus at the same time distinguished from the modes of being (handiness,
objective presence, reality) that characterize beings unlike Da-sein. We

Da-sein and Temporality

The Result of the Preparatory Fundamental Analysis
of Da-sein and the Task of a Primordia�
Existential Interpretation of This Being

What was gained by our preparatory analysis of Da-sein, and what are we
looking for? We have

found the fundamental constitution of

the being in

question, being-in-the-world, whose essential structures are centered in
disclosedness. The totality of this structural whole revealed itself as care.
The being of Da-sein is contained in care. The analysis of this being
took as its guideline existence, 1 which was defined by way of anticipation
as the essence of Da-sein. The term
sein

existence formally indicates that Da­
is as an understanding potentiality-of-being which is concerned in its

being about its being. Thus existing, I myself am that being. The devel­
opment of the phenomenon of care provided an insight into the con­
crete constitution of existence, that is, into its equiprimordial connection
with facticity and with the falling prey of Da-sein.
We are

looking for

the answer to the question of the meaning of

being in general, and above all the possibility of radically developing
this basic question* of all ontology. But freeing the horizon in which
something like being in general becomes intelligible amounts to clarify­
ing the possibility of the understanding of being in general, an under­
standing which itself belongs to the constitution of that being which we

the Problem of Metaphysics, section IV).

call Da-sein.2 The understanding of being, however, cannot be

radically

clarified as an essential factor in the being of Da-sein, unless the being to
whose being it belongs has been

primordially

interpreted in itself with

regard to its being.
Are we entitled to the claim that in characterizing Da-sein onto­
logically as care we have given a primordial interpretation of this being?
By what standard is the existential analytic of Da-sein to be measured
with regard to its primordiality or nonprimordiality? What then do we
mean by the primordiality of an ontological interpretation?
Ontological inquiry is a possible way of interpretation which we
characterized as

232

a

development and appropriation of an understand-

ing.' Every interpretation has its fore-having, its fore-sight, and its fore­
conception. If such an interpretation becomes an explicit task of an
inquiry, the totality of these "presuppositions" (which we call the

hermeneutical situation)

needs to be clarified and made secure before­

hand both in a fundamental experience of the "object" to be disclosed,
and in terms of that experience. In ontological interpretation beings
are freed with regard to their own constitution of being. Such an inter­
pretation obliges us first to give a phenomenal characterization of the
being we have taken as our theme and thus bring it into the scope of our
fore-having with which all the subsequent steps of our analysis are to
conform. But at the same time these steps need to be guided by the
possible fore-sight of the kind of being of the being in question. Fore­
having and fore-sight then prefigure at the same time the conceptuality
(fore-conception) to which all the structures of being are to be brought.
But a

primordial,

ontological interpretation requires not only in

general that the hermeneutical situation be secured in conformity with
the phenomena, but also the explicit assurance that

the totality

of the

beings taken as its theme have been brought to a fore-having. Similarly,
it is not sufficient just to make a first sketch of the being of these beings,
even if it is phenomenally based. If we are to have a fore-sight of being,
we must see it with respect to the

unity of the possible structural factors

belonging to it. Only then can the question of the meaning of the unity
that belongs to the totality of being of all beings be asked and answered
with phenomenal certainty.
Did the existential analysis of Da-sein which we made, arise from
such a hermeneutical situation as will guarantee the primordiality that
fundamental ontology requires? Can we proceed from the results
attained-that the being of Da-sein is care-to the question of the pri­
mordial unity of this structural totality?
What is the status of the fore-sight which has been guiding our
ontological procedure up to now? We defined the idea of existence as a
potentiality of being, a potentiality that understands and is concerned

Being and Time

II

about its own being. But this

potentiality-ofbeing

that is always

215

mine

is

free for authenticity or inauthenticity, or for a mode in which neither of
these has been differentiated.• Our previous interpretation was limited
to an analysis of indifferent or inauthentic existence, starting out with
average everydayness. Of course, it was possible and necessary to reach
a concrete definition of the existentiality of existence in this way. Still,
our ontological characterization of the constitution of existence was
flawed by an essential lack. Existence means potentiality-of-being, but
also authentic potentiality-of-being. As long as the existential structure of
authentic potentiality-of-being is not incorporated in the idea of existence, the fore-sight guiding an

existential

interpretation lacks primor­

diality.
And what is the situation with the fore-having of the hermeneutical
situation up to now? When and how did our existential analytic make
sure that by starting with everydayness it forced

all ofDa-sein-this being

from its "beginning" to its "end"-into the phenomenological view giving
us our theme? We did assert that care is the totality of the structural
whole of the constitution of being of Da-sein.5 But have we not at the
very beginning of our interpretation renounced the possibility of bring­
ing Da-sein as a whole to view? Everydayness is, after all, precisely the
being "between" birth and death. And if existence determines the being
of Da-sein and if its essence is also constituted* by potentiality-of-being,
then, as long as Da-sein exists, it must always, as such a potentiality, not
yet be something? A being whose essence is made up of existence essen­
tially resists the possibility of being comprehended as a total being. Not
only has the hermeneutical situation given us no assurance of "having"
the whole being up to now; it is even questionable whether the whole
being is attainable at all, and whether a primordial, ontological inter­
pretation of Da-sein must not get stranded-on the kind of being of the
thematic being itself.
One thing has become unmistakable. Our existential analytic of Da­
sein up to now cannot lay claim to primordiality. Its fore-having never
included more than the inauthentic being of Da-sein, of Da-sein as frag­
mentary. If the interpretation of the being of Da-sein is to become pri­
mordial as a foundation for the development of the fundamental ques­
tion of ontology, it will have to bring the being of Da-sein in its possible

authenticity and totality existentially to light beforehand.
Thus the task arises of placing Da-sein as a whole in our fore-hav­
ing. However; that means that we must first unpack the question of this
being's potentiality-for-being-a-whole. As long as Da-sein is, something is

* at the same time: already-being.

233

always still outstanding, what it can and will be. But the "end" itself
belongs to what is outstanding. The "end" of being-in-the-world is death.
This end, belonging to the potentiality-of-being, that is, to existence,
limits and defines the possible totality of Da-sein. The being-at-an-end*
of Da-sein in death, and thus its being a whole, can, however, be
included in our discussion of the possible being whole in a phenomenally
appropriate way only if an ontologically adequate, that is, an existential
concept of death has been attained. But as far as Da-seint goes, death is
only in an existentiell being toward death. t The existential structure of
this being turns out to be the ontological constitution of the potentiality­
for-being-a-whole of Da-sein. Thus, the whole existing Da-sein can be
brought into our existential fore-having. But can Da-sein also exist as a
whole authentically? How is the authenticity of existence to be defined at
all if not with reference to authentic existing? Where do we get our cri­
terion for this? Obviously Da-sein itself in its being must present the
possibility and way of its authentic existence, if such existence is nei­
ther imposed upon it ontically, nor ontologically fabricated. But an
authentic potentiality-of-being is attested by conscience. Like death, this
phenomenon of Da-sein requires a genuinely existential interpretation.
It leads to the insight that an authentic potentiality-of-being of Da-sein
lies in wanting-to-have-a-conscience. This existentiell possibility, how­
ever, tends, from the meaning of its being, to be made definite in an
existentiell way by being toward death.
With the demonstration of an authentic potentialityfor-being-a-whole
of Da-sein our existential analytic has secured the constitution of the pri­
mordial being of Da-sein. But the authentic potentialityfor-being-a-whole

becomes visible as a mode of care. With this the phenomenally ade­
quate basis for a primordial interpretation of the meaning of being of
Da-sein is also secured.
The primordial ontological ground of the existentiality of Da-sein,
however, is temporality. The articulated structural totality of the being of
Da-sein as care first becomes existentially intelligible in terms of tem­
porality. The interpretation of the meaning of being of Da-sein cannot
stop with this fact. The existential-temporal analysis of this being needs
concrete confirmation. We must go back and free the ontological struc­
tures of Da-sein already gained with regard to their temporal meaning.
Everydayness reveals itself as a mode of temporality. But by thus repeat­
ing our preparatory fundamental analysis of Da-sein, the phenomenon
235

of temporality itself will at the same time become more transparent. In

tenns of temporality, it becomes intelligible why Da-sein is and can be
historical in the ground of its being and, being historical, it can develop
historiography.
If temporality constitutes the primordial meaning of being of Dasein, and if this being is concerned about its being in its very being, then
care must need "time" and thus reckon with "time." The temporality of
Da-sein develops a "time calculation." The "time" experienced in such
calculation is the nearest phenomenal aspect of temporality. From it
originates the everyday, vulgar understanding of time. And that develops
into the traditional concept of time.
The clarification of the origin of the "time" "in which" innerworldly beings are encountered, of time as within-timeness, reveals an
essential possibility of the temporalization of temporality. Now the
understanding is being prepared for a still more primordial temporalization of temporality. In it is based the understanding of being that is
constitutive for the being of Da-sein. The project of a meaning of being
in general can be accomplished in the horizon of time.*
Thus the inquiry comprised in this division will traverse the following stages: The possible being whole of Da-sein and being toward
death (chapter I); the attestation of Da-sein of an authentic potentialityof-being and resolution (chapter II); the authentic potentiality-for-beinga-whole of Da-sein and temporality as the ontological meaning of care
(chapter III); temporality and everydayness (chapter IV); temporality
and historicity (chapter V); temporality and within-timeness as the origin
of the vulgar concept of time (chapter VI). 6

The Possible Being-a- Whole of Da-sein
and Being-toward-Death

46. The Seeming Impossibility of Ontologically Grasping

and Determining Da-sein as a Whole
The inadequacy of the hermeneutical situation from which the foregoing
analysis originated must be overcome. With regard to the fore-having,
which must necessarily be obtained, of the whole of Da-sein, we must ask
whether this being, as something existing, can become accessible at all in
its being. There seem to be important reasons that speak against the possibility of our required task, reasons that lie in the constitution of Da-sein
itself.
Care, which forms the totality of the structural whole of Da-sein,
obviously contradicts a possible being whole of this being according to
its ontological sense. The primary factor of care, "being ahead of itself,"
however, means that Da-sein always exists for the sake of itself. "As long
as it is," up until its end, it is related to its potentiality-of-being. Even
when it, still existing, has nothing further "ahead of it," and has "settled
its accounts," its being is still influenced by "being ahead of itself." Hope­
lessness, for example, does not tear Da-sein away from its possibilities,
but is only an independent mode of being toward these possibilities. Even
when one is without illusions and "is ready for anything," the "ahead of
itself' is there. This structural factor of care tells us unambiguously that
something is always still outstanding in Da-sein which has not yet become
"real" as a potentiality-of-its-being. A constant unfinished quality thus lies in

219

236

220

237

Being and Time

11.1

the essence of the constitution of Da-sein. 1bis lack of totality means that
there is still something outstanding in one's potentiality-for-being.
However, if Da-sein "exists" in such a way that there is absolutely
nothing more outstanding for it, it has also already thus become no­
longer-being-there. Eliminating what is outstanding in its being is equiv­
alent to annihilating its being. As long as Da-sein if as a being, it has
never attained its "wholeness." But if it does, this gain becomes the
absolute loss of being-in-the-world. It is then never again to be experi­
enced as a being.
The reason for the impossibility of experiencing Da-sein ontically
as an existing whole and thus of defining it ontologically in its wholeness
does not lie in any imperfection of our cognitive faculties. The hindrance
lies on the side of the being of this being. What cannot even be in such a
way that an experience of Da-sein could pretend to grasp it, fundamen­
tally eludes being experienced. But is it not then a hopeless undertaking
to try to discern the ontological wholeness of being of Da-sein?
As an essential structural factor of care, "being ahead of itself'
cannot be eliminated. But is what we concluded from this tenable? Did
we not conclude in a merely formal argumentation that it is impossible
to grasp the whole of Da-sein? Or did we not at bottom inadvertently
posit Da-sein as something objectively present ahead of which some­
thing not yet objectively present constantly moves along? Did our argu­
mentation grasp not-yet-being and the "ahead-of-itself' in a genuinely
existential sense? Did we speak about "end' and "totality" in a way phe­
nomenally appropriate to Da-sein? Did the expression "death" have a
biological significance or one that is existential and ontological, or
indeed was it sufficiently and securely defined at all? And have we actu­
ally exhausted all the possibilities of making Da-sein accessible in its
totality?
We have to answer these questions before the problem of the
wholeness of Da-sein can be dismissed as nothing. The question of the
wholeness of Da-sein, both the existentiell question about a possible
potentiality-for-being-a-whole, as well as the existential question about
the constitution of being of "end" and "wholeness," contain the task of
a positive analysis of the phenomena of existence set aside up to now. In
the center of these considerations we have the task of characterizing
ontologically the being-toward-the-end of Da-sein and of achieving an
existential concept of death. Our inquiry related to these topics is struc­
tured in the following way: The possibility of experiencing the death of
others, and the possibility of grasping the whole of Da-sein (section 47);
what is outstanding, end and wholeness (section 48); how the existential
analysis of death is distinguished from other possible interpretations of
this phenomenon (section 49); preliminary sketch of the existential and

4 7. The Possibility of Experiencing the Death of Others

and the Possibility of Grasping Da-sein as a Whole
When Da-sein reaches its wholeness in death, it simultaneously loses
the being of the there. The transition to no-longer-being-there lifts Da­
sein right out of the possibility of experiencing this transition and of
understanding it as something experienced. This kind of thing is denied
to actual Da-sein in relation to itself. The death of others, then, is all the
more penetrating. In this way, an end ofDa-sein becomes "objectively"
accessible.Da-sein can gain an experience of death, all the more because
it is essentially being-with with others. This "objective" givenness of
death must then make possible an ontological analysis of the totality of
Da-sein.
Thus from the kind of being that Da-sein possesses as being-withone-another, we might glean the fairly obvious information that when
the Da-sein of others has come to an end, it might be chosen as a substitute theme for our analysis of the totality of Da-sein. But does this lead
us to our intended goal?
Even the Da-sein of others, when it has reached its wholeness in
death, is a no-longer-being-there in the sense of no-longer-being-in-the­
world. Does not dying mean going-out-of-the-world and losing being­
in-the-world? Yet, the no-longer-being-in-the-world of the deceased
(understood in an extreme sense) is still a being* in the sense of the
mere objective presence of a corporeal thing encountered. In the dying
of others that remarkable phenomenon of being can be experienced
that can be defmed as the transition of a being from the kind of being of
Da-sein (or of life) to no-longer-being-there. The end of the being qua Da­
sein is the

beginning of this being qua something

objectively present.

This interpretation of the transition from Da-sein to something
merely objectively present, however, misses the phenomenal content in
that the being still remaining does not represent a mere corporeal thing.
Even the objectively present corpse is, viewed theoretically, still

a

possi­

ble object for pathological anatomy whose understanding is oriented
toward the idea of life. Merely-being-objectively-present is "more" than

lifeless,

material thing. In it we encounter something

lost its life.

But even this way of characterizing what still remains does not
exhaust the complete phenomenal findings with regard to Da-sein.
The "deceased, " as distinct from the dead body, has been torn
away from "those remaining behind," and is the object of "being taken
care of" in funeral rites, the burial, and the cult of graves. And that is so
because he is "still more" in his kind of being than an innerworldly
thing at hand to be taken care of. In lingering together with him in
mourning and commemorating, those remaining behind are with him, in
a mode of concern which honors him. Thus the relation of being to
the dead must not be grasped as a being together with something at
hand which takes care of it.
In such being-with with the dead, the deceased himself is no longer
factically "there." However, being-with always means being-with-one­
another in the same world. The deceased has abandoned our "world"
and left it behind. It is in terms of this world that those remaining can still

be with him.

239

The more appropriately the no-longer-being-there of the deceased
is grasped phenomenally, the more clearly it can be seen that in such
being-with with the dead, the real having-come-to-an-end of the deceased
is precisely not experienced. Death does reveal itself as a loss, but as a
loss experienced by those remaining behind. However, in suffering the
loss, the loss of being as such which the dying person "suffers" does
not become accessible. We do not experience the dying of others in a
genuine sense; we are at best always just "there" too.
And even if it were possible and feasible to clarify "psychologi­
cally" the dying of others, this would by no means let us grasp the way of
being we have in mind, namely, coming-to-an-end. We are asking about
the ontological meaning of the dying of the person who dies, as a poten­
tiality-of-being of his being, and not about the way of being-with and the
still-being-there of the deceased with those left behind. If death as expe­
rienced in others is to be the theme of our analysis of the end of Da-sein
and its totality, this cannot give us what it presumes to give, either onti­
cally or ontologically.
After all, taking the dying of others as a substitute theme for the
ontological analysis of the finished character of Da-sein and its totality
rests on an assumption that demonstrably fails altogether to recognize
the kind of being of Da-sein. That is what one presupposes when one is
of the opinion that any Da-sein could arbitrarily be replaced by another,
so that what cannot be experienced in one's own Da-sein is accessible in
another Da-sein. But is this assumption reall y so groundless?
Indubitably, the fact that one Da-sein can be represented by another
belongs to the possibilities-of-being of being-with-one-another in the
world. In the everydayness of taking care of things, constant use of such

11.1

Being and Time

223

representability is made in many ways. Any going to ... , any fetching
of .. . , is representable in the scope of the "surrounding world" initially
taken care of. The broad multiplicity of ways of being-in-the-world in
which one person can be represented by another extends not only to the
used-up modes of public being with one another, but concerns as well
the possibilities of taking care of things limited to definite circles, tai­
lored to professions, social classes, and stages of life. But the very mean­
ing of such representation is such that it is always a representation "in"
and "together with" something, that is, in taking care of something.
Everyday Da-sein understands itself initially and for the most part, how­
ever, in terms of

what it is accustomed to take care of. "One is" what one

does. With regard to this being (the everyday being-absorbed-with-one­
another in the "world" taken care of), representability is not only possible in general, but is even constitutive for being-with-one-another.Here
one Da-sein can and must, within certain limits,

"be"

another Da-sein.

However, this po ssibility of representation gets completely
stranded when it is a matter of representing the possibility of being that
constitutes the coming-to-an-end of Da-sein and gives it its totality as
such.

No one can take the other's dying away from him.

Someone can go "to

his death for an other." However, that always means to sacrifice oneself
for the other

"in a definite matter." Such dying for ...

can never, however,

mean that the other has thus had his death in the least taken away.
Every Da-sein must itself actually take dying upon itself. Insofar as it
"is," death is always essentially my own.And it indeed signifies a peculiar
possibility of being in which it is absolutely a matter of the being of my
own Da-sein. In dying, it becomes evident that death* is ontologically
constituted by mineness and existence! Dying is not an event, but a
phenomenon to be understood existentially in an eminent sense still
to be delineated more closely.
But if "ending," as dying, constitutes the totality of Da-sein, the
being of the totality itself must be conceived as an existential phe­
nomenon of my own Da-sein. In "ending," and in the totality thus con­
stituted of Da-sein, there is essentially no representation. The way out
suggested fails to recognize this existential fact when it proposes the
dying of others as a substitute theme for the analysis of totality.
Thus the attempt to make the totality of Da-sein phenomenally
accessible in an appropriate way gets stranded again. But the result of
these considerations is not just negative. They were oriented toward
the phenomena, even if rather crudely. We have indicated that death is
an existential phenomenon. Our inquiry is thus forced into a purely

*

240

224

II. I

Being and Time

existential orientation toward my own Da-sein. For the analysis of death
as dying, there remains only the possibility of bringing this phenomenon
either to a purely

existential concept or,

on the other hand, of renounc­

ing any ontological understanding of it.
Furthermore, it was evident in our characterization of the transi­
tion from Da-sein to no-longer-being-there as no-longer-being-in-the­
world that the going-out-of-the-world of Da-sein in the sense of dying
must be distinguished from a going-out-of-the-world of what is only
alive. The ending of what is only alive we formulate terminologically as

241

perishing. The distinction can become visible only by distinguishing the
ending characteristic of Da-sein from the ending of a living thing.2 Dying
can, of course, also be conceived physiologically and biologically. But the
medical concept

of"exitus"

does not coincide with that of perishing.

From the previous discussion of the ontological possibility of con­
ceiving of death, it becomes clear at the same time that substructures of
beings of a different kind of being (objective presence or life) thrust
themselves to the fore unnoticeably and threaten to confuse the inter­
pretation of the phenomenon, even the first appropriate

presentation of

it. We can cope with this problem only by looking for an ontologically
adequate way of defining constitutive phenomena for our further anal­
ysis, such as end and totality.

48. What is Outstanding, End, and Totality
Our ontological characterization of end and totality can only be pre­
liminary in the scope of this inquiry. To perform this task adequately we
must not only set forth the formal structure of end in general and total­
ity in general. At �e same time, we must disentangle the structural vari­
ations possible for them in different realms, that is, deformalized varia­
tions which are related to definite beings with content and structurally
determined in terms of their being. This task again presupposes a suffi­
ciently unequivocal and positive interpretation of the kinds of being
that require a regional separation of the whole of beings. The under­
standing of these ways of being, however, requires a clarified idea of
being in general. The task of adequately carrying out the ontological
analysis of end and totality gets stranded not only because the theme is
so far-reaching, but because there is a difficulty in principle: in order to
master this task, we must presuppose that precisely what we are seeking
in this inquiry (the meaning of being in general) is something that we
have found already and with which we are quite familiar.
In the following considerations, the "variations" in which we are
chiefly interested are those of end and totality; these are ontological
determinations of Da-sein which are to lead to a primordial interpreta-

Being and Time

11.1

225

tion of this being. With constant reference to the existential constitution
of Da-sein already developed, we must initially try to decide how onto­
logically inappropriate to Da-sein are the concepts of end and totality initially forcing themselves upon us, no matter how indefinite they are categorially. The rejection of such concepts must be further developed to a
positive

directive

to their specific realms. Thus our understanding of

end and totality in their variant forms as existentials will be strengthened, and this guarantees the possibility of an ontological interpretation
of death.
But if the analysis of the end and totality of Da-sein takes an ori­
entation of such broad scope, this nevertheless cannot mean that the
existential concepts of end and totality are to be gained by way of a
deduction. On the contrary, it is a matter of taking the existential mean­
ing of the coming-to-an-end of Da-sein from Da-sein itself and of showing
how this "ending" can constitute a

being whole of that being that exists.

What has been discussed up to now about death can be formulated
in three theses:

1. As long as Da-sein is, a not-yet belongs to it, which it will be-what is
constantly outstanding.

2. The coming-to-its-end of what is not-yet-at-an-end (in which what is
outstanding is liquidated with regard to its being) has the character of
no-longer-being-there.

3. Coming-to-an-end implies a mode of being in which the actual Da-sein
absolutely cannot be represented by someone else.
In Da-sein there is inevitably a constant "fragmentariness" which
finds its end in death. But may we interpret the phenomenal fact that
this not-yet "belongs" to Da-sein as long as it is to mean that it is some­
thing

outstanding?

With regard to what kind of beings do we speak of

something outstanding? The expression means indeed what "belongs" to
a being, but is still lacking. Outstanding, as lacking, is based on a belong­
ingness. For example, the remainder of a debt still to be paid is out­
standing. What is outstanding is not yet available. Liquidating the "debt"
as paying off what is outstanding means that the money "comes in,"
that is, the remainder is paid in sequence, whereby the not-yet is, so to
speak, filled out until the sum owed is "all together." Thus, to be out­
standing means that what belongs together is not yet together. Onto­
logically, this implies the unhandiness of portions to be brought in
which have the same kind of being of those already at hand. The latter in
their turn do not have their kind of being modified by having the
remainder come

in. The existing untogethemess is liquidated by a cumu­

lative placing together.

243

We characterize the together, or the

The untogether belonging to such a mode of the together, lacking
as something outstanding, can, however, by no means ontologically
define the not-yet that belongs to Da-sein as its possible death. Da-sein
does not have the kind of being of a thing at hand in the world at all.
The together of the being that Da-sein is "in running its course" until it
ha8 completed "its course" is not constituted by a "progressive" piecing­
on of beings that, somehow and somewhere, are already at hand in
their own right. That Da-sein should

been fille d out is so far from being the case that precisely then it no
longer is. Da-sein always already exists in such a way that its not-yet

belongs to it.

But are there not beings which are as they are and to which

a not-yet can belong, without these beings necessarily having the kind of
being of Da-sein?
For example, one

can

say that the last quarter of the moon is out­

standing until it is full. The not-yet decreases with the disappearance of
the shadow covering it. And yet the moon is, after all, always already
objectively present as a whole. Apart from the fact that the moon is
never

wholly

to be grasped even when it is full, the not-yet by no means

signifies a not-yet-being-together of parts belonging together, but rather
pertains only to the way we

grasp

it perceptually. The not-yet that

belongs to Da-sein, however, not only remains preliminarily and at
times inaccessible to one's own or to others' experience, it "is" not yet
"real" at all. The problem does not pertain to the grasp of the not-yet of
the character of Da-sein, but rather its possible

we must reflect on beings to whose kind of being becoming

belongs.
For example, the unripe fruit moves toward its ripeness. In ripen­
ing, what it not yet is is by no means pieced together as something not­
yet-objectively-present. The fruit ripens itself, and this ripening charac­
terizes its being as fruit. Nothing we can think of which could be added
on could remove the unripeness of the fruit, if this being did not ripen

of itself The not-yet of unripeness does not mean something other which
is outstanding that could be objectively present in and with it in a way
indifferent to the fruit. It means the fruit itself in its specific kind of
being. The sum that is not yet complete is, as something at hand, "indif­
ferent" to the unhandy remainder that is lacking. Strictly speaking, it can
be neither indifferent to it nor not indifferent. The ripening fruit, how-

244

ever, is not only not indifferent to its unripeness as an other to itself,
but, ripening, it

is the unripeness. The not-yet is

already included in its

227

own being, by no means as an arbitrary determination, but as a con­
stituent. Correspondingly, Da-sein, too,

is always already its not-yef

as

long as it is.
What constitutes the "unwholeness" in Da-sein, the constant being­
ahead-of-itself, is neither a summative together which is outstanding,
nor even a not-yet-having-become-accessible, but rather a not-yet that
any Da-sein always has to be, given the being that it is. Still, the com­
parison with the unripeness of the fruit does show essential differences
despite some similarities. To reflect on these differences means that we
shall recognize how indefinite our previous discussion of end and end­
ing has hitherto been.
Ripening is the specific being of the fruit. It is also a kind of being
of the not-yet (unripeness}, and is formally analogous to Da-sein in that
the latter, as well

as

the former, always already

is its not-yet in a sense yet

to be defined. But even then, this does not mean that ripeness as "end"
and death as "end" coincide with regard to the their ontological struc­
ture as ends. With ripeness, the fruit fulfills itself. But is the death at
which Da-sein arrives a fulfillment in this sense? It is true that Da-sein has
"completed its course" with its death. Has it thus necessarily exhausted
its specific possibilities? Rather, are these not precisely what gets taken
from it? Even "unfulfilled" Da-sein ends. On the other hand, Da-sein
so little needs to ripen only with its death that it can already have gone
beyond that ripeness before the end. For the most part, it ends in unful­
fillment, or else disintegrated and used up.
Ending does not necessarily mean fulfilling oneself. It thus
becomes more urgent to ask

in what sense, if any, death must be grasped as

the ending of Da-sein.
Initially, ending means stopping, and it means this in senses that are
ontologically different. The rain stops. It is no longer objectively present.
The road stops. This ending does not cause the road to disappear, but
this stopping rather determines the road as this objectively present one.
Hence ending, as stopping, can mean either to change into the absence
of objective presence or, however, to be objectively present only when
the end comes. The latter kind of ending
an

unfinished

again be determinative for

thing objectively present, as a road under construction

breaks off, or it may rather constitute the "finishedness" of something
objectively present-the painting is finished with the last stroke of the
brush.
But ending as getting finished does not include fulfillment. On
the other hand, whatever has got to be fulfilled must reach its possible
finishedness. Fulfillment is the mode of "finishedness," and is founded
upon it. Finishedness is itself possible only as a determination of some­
thing objectively present or at hand.

Even ending in the sense of disappearing can still be modified
according to the kind of being of the being. The rain is at an end, that is,
it has disappeared. The bread is at an end, that is, used up, no longer
available as something at hand.
as

246

None of these modes of ending are able to characterize death appropriately
the end of Da-sein. If dying were understood as being-at-an-end in the

sense of an ending of the kind discussed, Da-sein would be posited as
something objectively present or at hand. In death, Da-sein is neither ful­
filled nor does it simply disappear; it has not become finished or com­
pletely available as something at hand.
Rather, just as Da-sein constantly already is its not-yet as long as it
is, it also always already is its end. The ending that we have in view when
we speak of death, does not signify a being-at-an-end of Da-sein, but*
rather a being toward the end of this being. Death is a way to be that Da­
sein takes over as soon as it is. "As soon as a human being is born, he is
old enough to die right away. "4
Ending, as being toward the end, must be clarified ontologically in
terms of the kind of being of Da-sein. And supposedly the possibility of an
existing being of the not-yet that lies "before" the "end" will become intel­
ligible only if the character of ending has been determined existentially.
The existential clarification of being toward the end first provides the ade­
quate basis for defining the possible meaning of our discussion of a totality
of Da-sein, if indeed this totality is to be constituted by death as an "end."
The attempt to reach an understanding of the totality of Da-sein by
starting with a clarification of the not-yet and proceeding to a characterization of ending has not yet attained its goal. It showed only nega­
tively that the not-yet which Da-sein always is resists an interpretation as
something outstanding. The end toward which Da-sein is, as existing,
remains inappropriately defined by being-at-an-end. At the same time,
however, our reflections should make it clear that their course must be
reversed. A positive characterization of the phenomena in question (not­
yet-being, ending, totality) can be successful only when it is unequivocally
oriented toward the constitution of being of Da-sein. This unequivocal
character, however, is protected in a negative way from being side­
tracked when we have an insight into the regional belonging together of
the structures of end and totality which belong to Da-sein ontologically.
The positive, existential, and ontological interpretation of death
and its character of end are to be developed following the guideline of
the fundamental constitution of Da-sein, attained up to now-the phe­
nomenon of care.

49. How the Existential Analysis of Death Differs from

Other Possible Interpretations of This Phenomenon
The unequivocal character of the ontological interpretation* of death
should be made more secure by explicitly bringing to mind what this
interpretation can

not ask about and where it would be useless to

expect

information and instructions.
In the broadest sense, death is a phenomenon of life. t life must be
understood as a kind of being to which belongs a being-in-the-world. It
can only be defined in a privative orientation to Da-sein. Da-sein, too,
can be considered as pure life. For the biological and physiological line
of questioning, it then moves into the sphere of being which we know as
the world of animals and plants. In this field, dates and statistics about
the life-span of plants, animals, and human beings can be ontically ascer­
tained. Connections between the life-span, reproduction, and growth
can be known. The "kinds" of death, the causes, "arrangements," and
ways of i ts occurrence can be investigated.5
An ontological problematic underlies this biological and ontic
investigation of death. We must still ask how the essence of death is
defined in terms of the essence of life. The ontic inquiry into death has
always already decided about this. More or less clarified preconceptions
of life and death are operative in it. These preliminary concepts need to
be sketched out in the ontology of Da-sein. Within the ontology of Dasein, which has priority over an ontology of life, the existential analytic of
death is subordinate to the fundamental constitution of Da-sein. We
called the ending of what is alive perishing. Da-sein, too, "has" its physi­
ological death of the kind appropriate to anything that lives and has it
not ontically in isolation, but as also determined by its primordial kind of
being. Da-sein, too, can end without authentically dying, though on the
o ther hand, qua Da-sein, it does not simply perish. We call this inter­
mediate phenomenon its

being in which

Da-sein

demise. Let the term dying stand for the way of
is toward its death. Thus we can say that Da-sein

never perishes . Da-sein can only demise as long as it dies. The medical
and biological inquiry into demising can attain results which can also
b e come significant ontologically if the fundamental ori entation is
ensured for an existential interpretation of death. Or must sickness and
death in general-even from a medical point of view-be conceived primarily as existential phenomena?
The existential interpretation of death is prior to any biology and
ontology of life. But it also is the foundation for any biographico-his-

24 7

230

Being and Time

11.1

torical or ethnologico-psychological inquiry into death. A " typology" of
" dying" characterizing the states and ways in which a demise is " experi­
enced," already presupposes the concept of death. Moreover, a psy­
chology of "dying" rather gives information about the "life" of the "dying
person" than about dying itself. That is only a reflection of the fact that
when Da-sein dies-and even when it dies authentically-it does not have
to do so with an experience of its factical demise, or in such an experi­
ence. Similarly, the interpretations of death in primitive peoples, of
their behavior toward death in magic and cult, throw light primarily on
the understanding of Da-sein; but the interpretation of this understand­
ing already requires an existential analytic and a corresponding con­
cept of death.
The ontological analysis of being-toward-the-end, on the o ther
hand, does not anticipate any existentiell stance toward death. If death is
defined as the "end" of Da-sein, that is, of being-in-the-world, no ontic
decision has been made as to whether "after death" another being is still

248

possible, either higher or lower, whether Da-sein " lives on" or even,
"outliving itself," is "immortal." Nor is anything decided ontically about
the " otherworldly" and its possibility any more than about the " this­
worldly"; as if norms and rules for behavior toward death should be
proposed for "edification. " But our analysis of death remains purely
" this-worldly" in that it interprets the phenomenon solely with respect to
the question of how it

ask with any methodological assurance about what "is

Whether such a question presents a possible

theoretical question at all is

not to be decided here . The this-worldly, ontological interpretation of
death comes before any ontic, other-worldly speculation.
Finall y , an existential analysis of death lies outside the scope of
what might be discussed under the rubric of a "metaphysics of death. "
The questions of how and when death " came into the world, " what
"meaning" it can and should have

an evil and suffering in the whole of

beings-these are ques tions that necessarily presuppose an understand­
ing not only of the character of being of death, but the ontology of the
whole of beings as a whole and the ontological clarification of evil and
negativity in particular.
The existential analysis is methodically prior to the questions of a
biology, psychology theodicy, and theology of death. Taken ontically, the
results of the analysis show the peculiar formality and emptiness of any
ontological characterization. However, that must not make us blind to
the rich and complex structure of the phenomenon. Since Da-sein never
becomes accessible at all as something objectively present, because being
possible belongs in its own way to its kind of being, even less may we

Being and Time

11.1

23 1

expect to simply read off the ontological structure of death, if indeed
death is an eminent possibility of Da-sein.
On the other hand, our analysis cannot be supported by an idea of
death that has been devised arbitrarily and at random. We can restrain
this arbitrariness only by giving beforehand an ontological characteri­
zation of the kind of being in which the "end" enters into the average
everydayness of Da-sein. For this we need to envisage fully the struc­
tures of everydayness worked out earlier. The fact that existentiell pos­
sibilities of being toward death have their resonance in an existential
analysis of death, is implied by the essence of any ontological inquiry. All
the more explicitly, then, must an existentiell neutrality go together
with the existential conceptual definition, especially with regard to death,
where the character of possibility of Da-sein can be revealed most clearly

249

of all . The existential problematic aims solely at developing the onto­
logical structure of the being-toward the-end of Da-sein.6
-

50. A Preliminary Sketch of the Existential

and Ontological Structure ofDeath
From our considerations of something outstanding, end, and totality
there has resulted the necessity of interpreting the phenomenon of
death as being-toward-the-end in terms of the fundamental constitution
of Da-sein. Only in this way can it become clear how a wholeness con­
stituted by being-toward-the-end is possible in Da-seiil itself, in accordance with its structure of being. We have seen that care is the funda­
mental consti tution of Da-sein. The ontological significance of this
expression was expressed in the "definition": being-ahead-of-itself­
already-being-in ( the world) as being-together-with beings encountered
(within the world) .7 Thus the fundamental characteristics of the being of
Da-sein are expressed: in being-ahead-of-itself, existence, in alreadybeing-in .. . , facticity, in being-together-with . .. , falling prey. Provided
that death belongs to the being of Da-sein in an eminent sense, it (or
being-toward-the-end) must be able to be defined in terms of these char­
acteristics.
We must, in the first instance, make it clear in a preliminary sketch
how the existence, facticity, and falling prey of Da-sein are revealed in
the phenomenon of death.
The interpretation of the not-yet, and thus also of the most extreme
not-yet, of the end of Da-sein in the sense of something outstanding was
rejected as inappropriate. For it included the ontological distortion of Da­
sein as something obj ectively present. Being-at-an-end means existen­
tially being-toward-the-end. The most extreme not-yet has the character of
something to

which Da-sein relates. The end is imminent for Da-sein.

Death

250

232

Being and Time

11.1

is not something not yet objectively present, nor the last outstanding
element reduced to a minimum, but rather an

imminence.

However, many things can be imminent for Da-sein as being-in-the­
world. The character of imminence is not in itself distinctive for death.
On the contrary, this interpretation could even make us suspect that
death would have to be understood in the sense of an imminent event to
be encountered in the surrounding world. For example, a thunderstorm
can be imminent, remodeling a house, the arrival of a friend, accord­
ingly, being which are objectively present, at hand or Da-sein-with.Immi­
nent death does not have this kind of being.
But a journey, for example, can also be imminent for Da-sein, or a
discussion with others, or a renouncing something which Da-sein itself can
be-its own possibilities-of-being which are founded in being-with others.
Death is a possibility of being that Da-sein always has to take upon
itself. With death, Da-sein stands before itself in its ownmost potentiality­
of-being.In this possibility, Da-sein is concerned about its being-in-the­
world absolutely.Its death is the possibility of no-longer-being-able-to-be­
there. When Da-sein is imminent to itself as this possibility, it is

completely

thrown back upon its ownmost potentiality-of-being. Thus imminent to
i tself, all relations to other Da-sein are dissolved in it. This nonrelational
ownmost possibility is at the same time the most extreme one. As a
potentiality of being, Da-sein is unable to bypass the possibility of death.
Death is the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Da-sein. Thus

251

death reveals itself as the uwnmost nonrelational possibility not to be bypassed.
As such, it is an eminent imminence. Its existential possibility is grounded
in the fact that Da-sein is essentially disclosed to itself, in the way of
being-ahead-of-itself.This structural factor of care has its most primor­
dial concretion in being-toward-death. Being-toward-the-end becomes
phenomenally clearer as being toward the eminent possibility of Da­
sein which we have characterized.
The ownmost nonrelational possibility not to be bypassed is not
created by Da-sein subsequently and occasionally in the course of its
being. Rather, when Da-sein exists, it is already

thrown

into this possi­

bility. Initially and for the most part, Da-sein does not have any explicit
or even theoretical knowledge of the fact that it is delivered over to its
death, and that death thus belongs to being-in-the-world. Thrownness
into death reveals itself to it more primordially and penetratingly in the
attunement of Ang.s-t. 8 Ang.s-t in the face of death is

Being and Time

11.1

233

Da-sein, the disclosedness of the fact that Da-sein exists as thrown being­
toward-i�nd. Thus the existential concept of dying is clarified as thrown
being toward the ownmost nonrelational potentiality-of-being not to be
bypassed. Precision is gained by distinguishing this from pure disap­
pearance, and also from merely perishing, and finally from the "experi­
ence" of a demise.
Being-toward-the-end does not first arise through some attitude
which occasionally turns up, rather it belongs essentially to the thrown­
ness of Da-sein which reveals itself in attunement (mood) in various
ways. The factical "knowledge" or "lack of knowledge" prevalent in Da­
sein as to its ownmost being-toward-the-end is only the expression of the
existentiell possibility of maintaining itself in this being in different
ways. The fact that factically many people initially and for the most part
do not know about death must not be used to prove that being-toward­
death does not "generally" belong to Da-sein, but only proves that Da­
sein, fleeingfrom it, initially and for the most part covers over its own­
most being-toward-death. Da-sein dies factically as long as it exists, but
initially and for the most part in the mode of falling prey. For factical
existing is not only generally and without further differentiation a
thrown potentiality-for-being-in-the-world, but it is always already
absorbed in the "world" taken care of. In this entangled being together
with . .. , the flight from uncanniness makes itself known, that is, the
flight from its ownmost being-toward-death. Existence, facticity, falling
prey characterize being-toward-the-end, and are accordingly constitutive for the existential concept of death.

With regard to its ontological pos­

sibility, dying is grounded in care. *
But if being toward death belongs primordially and essentially to
the being of Da-sein, it must also be demonstrated in everydayness,
although initially in an inauthentic way. And if being-toward-the-end is
even supposed to offer the existential possibility for an existentiell whole­
ness of Da-sein, this would give the phenomenal confirmation for the
thesis that care is the ontological term for the wholeness of the structural
totality ofDa-sein. However, for the complete phenomenal justification
of this statement, a preliminary

sketch

of the connection between being­

toward-death and care is not sufficient. Above all , we must be able to see
this connection in the

concretion nearest toDa-sein,

its everydayness.

toward-death, Da-sein is related

to itself as

an eminent potentiality-of­

being. But the self of everydayness is the they9 which is constituted in
public interpretedness which expresses itself in idle talk. Thus, idle talk
must make manifest in what way everyday Da-sein interprets its being­
toward-death. Unders tanding, which is also always attuned, that is,
mooded, always forms the basis of this interpretation. Thus we must
ask how the attuned understanding lying in the idle talk of the they has
disclosed being-toward-death. How is the they related in an under­
standing way to its ownmost nonrelational possibility not-to-be-bypassed
of Da-sein? What attunement discloses to the they that it has been deliv­
ered over to death, and in what way?
The publicness of everyday being-with-one-another "knows" death

253

as a constantly occurring event, as a " case of death . " Someone or
another "dies," be it a neighbor or a stranger. People unknown to us
"die" daily and hourly. "Death" is encountered as a familiar event occur­
ring within the world. As such, it remains in the inconspicuousness10
characteristic of everyday encounters. The they has also already secured
an interpretation for this event. The "fleeting" talk about this which is
either expressed or else mostly kept back says: One also dies at the end,
but for now one is not involved.
The analysis of"one dies" reveals unambiguously the kind of being
of everyday being toward death. In such talk, death is understood as
an indeterminate s omething which first has to show up from some­
where, but which right now is

not yet objectively present for oneself,

and is

thus no threat. "One dies" spreads the opinion that death, so to speak,
strikes the they. The public interpretation of Da-sein says that "one dies"
because in this way everybody can convince him/herself that in no case
is it I myself, for this one is

no one.

" Dying" is levelled down to an event

which does concern Da-sein, but which belongs to no one in particular.
If idle talk is always ambiguous, so is this way of talking about death.
Dying, which is essentially and irreplaceably mine, is distorted into a
publicly occurring event which the they encounters. Characteristic talk
speaks about death as a constantly occurring "case." It treats it as some­
thing always already "real, " and veils its character of possibility and con­
comitantly the two factors belonging to i t, that it is nonrelational and
cannot-be-bypassed. With such ambiguity, Da-sein puts itself in the posi­
tion of losing itself in the they with regard to an eminent potentiality-of­
being that belongs to its own self. The they justifies and aggravates the

temptation

of covering over11 for itself its ownmost being-toward-death.

The evasion of death which covers over, dominates everydayness
so stubbornly that, in being-with-one-another, the "neighbors" often try
to convince the "dying person" that he will escape death and soon return
again to the tranquillized everydayness of his world taken care of. This

Being and Time

11.1

235

"concern" has the intention of thus "comforting" the "dying person." It
wants to bring him back to Da-sein by helping him to veil completely his
ownmost nonrelational possibility. Thus, the they makes sure of a

stant tranquillization about death.

con-

But, basically, this tranquillization is

254

not only for the "dying person," but just as much for "those who are
comforting him." And even in the case of a demise, publicness is still not
to be disturbed and made uneasy by the event in the carefreeness it has
made sure of. Indeed, the dying of others is seen often as a social incon­
venience, if not a downright tactlessness, from which publicness should
be spared.12
But along with this tranquillization, which keeps Da-sein away from
its death, the they at the same time justifies itself and makes itself
respectable by silently ordering the way in which

one

is supposed to

behave toward death in general. Even "thinking about death" is regarded
publicly as cowardly fear, a sigh of insecurity on the part of Da-sein and
a dark flight from the world.

52. Everyday Being-toward-Death and the

Complete Existential Concept of Death
Being-toward-the-end was determined in a preliminary existential sketch
as being toward one's ownmost nonrelational potentiality-of-being not­

to-be-bypassed. Existing being toward this possibility, brings itself before
the absolute impossibility of existence. Beyond this seemingly empty
characteristic of being-toward-death, the concretion of this being
revealed itself in the mode of everydayness. In accordance with the ten­
dency toward falling prey essential to everydayness, being-toward-death
proved to be an evasion of it, an evasion that covers over. Whereas pre­
viously our inquiry made the transition from the formal preliminary
sketch of the ontological structure of death to the concrete analysis of
everyday being-toward-the-end, we now wish to reverse the direction
and attain the complete existential concept of death with a supplemen­
tary interpretation of everyday being-toward-the-end.
The explication of everyday being-toward-death stayed with the
idle talk of the they: one also dies sometime, but for the time being not
yet. Up to now we solely interpreted the "one dies" as such. In the "also
sometime, but for the time being not yet," everydayness acknowledges
something like a

certainty of death. Nobody doubts that one dies. But this

"not doubting" need not already imply that kind of being-certain that
corresponds to the way death-in the sense of the eminent possibility
characterized above-enters into Da-sein. Everydayness gets stuck in this
ambiguous acknowledgment of the "certainty" of death-in order to

256

weaken the certainty by covering dying over still more and alleviating its
own thrownness into death.
By its very meaning, this evasive covering over of death can

like the expression "truth," has a double meaning. Primordially, truth

II. I

Being and Time

237

means the same as being-disclosive as a mode of behavior of Da-sein.
From this comes the derivative meaning: disclosedness of beings .
Accordingly, certainty is primordially tantamount to being-certain as a
kind of being of Da-sein. However, in a derivative significance, any being
of which Da-sein can be certain is also called " certain."
One mode of certainty is

conviction.

In conviction, Da-sein lets the

testimony of the thing itself that has been discovered ( the true thing
itself) be the sole determinant for its being toward that thing under­
standingly. Holding-something-for-true is adequate as a way of keeping
oneself in the truth, if it is based on the discovered beings themselves,
and as a being toward the beings thus discovered, has become trans­
parent to itself with regard to its appropriateness to them. Something
like this is lacking in any arbitrary invention or in the mere " opinion"
about a being.
The adequacy of holding-for-true is measured by the truth claim to
which it belongs. This claim gets its justification from the kind of being
of the beings to be disclosed, and from the direction of the disclosure.
The kind of truth and, along with it, the certainty, changes with the var­
ious kinds of beings, and accords with the leading tendency and scope of
the disclosure. Our present considerations are limited to an analysis of
being-certain with regard to death; and this being-certain will, in the
end, present us with an eminent

certainty of Da-sein.

For the most part, everyday Da-sein covers over its ownm ost non­
relational possibility of being not-to-be-bypassed. This factical tendency
to cover over confirm s our thesis that D a-sein, as fac ti c al, is in
"untruth."15 Thus the certainty which belongs to such a covering over of
being-toward-death must be an inappropriate way of holding-for-true,
and not an uncertainty in the sense of doubting. Inappropriate certainty
keeps that of which it is certain covered over. If "one" understands
death as an event encountered in the surrounding world, the certainty
related to this does not get at being-toward-the-end.
They say that it is certain that "death" comes.

They

say it and over­

look the fact that, in order to be able to be certain of death, Da-sein itself
must always be certain of its ownmost nonrelational potentiality-of-being
not-to-be-bypassed. They say that death is certain, and thus entrench in
Da-sein the illusion that it is

itself certain

of its own death. And what is

the ground of everyday being-certain? Evidently it is not just mutual
persuasion. Yet one experiences daily the "dying" of others. Death is an
undeniable "fact of experience . "
The way i n which everyday being-toward-death understands the
certainty thus grounded, betrays itself when it tries to " think" about
death, even when it does so with critical foresight-that is to say, in an
appropriate way. So far as one knows, all human beings "die." Death is

257

238

Being and Time

11.1

probable to the highest degree for every human being, yet it is not
"unconditionally" certain. Strictly speaking, "only" an empirical certainty
may be attributed to death.Such certainty falls short of the highest cer­
tainty, the apodictical one, which we attain in certain areas of theoretical
knowledge.
In this "critical" determination of the certainty of death and its
imminence, what is manifested in the first instance is, once again, the
failure to recognize the kind of being of Da-sein and the being-toward­
death belonging to it, a failure characteristic of everydayness.The fact

that demise, as an event that occurs, is "only" empirically certain, in no way
decides about the certainty of death. Cases of death may be the factical
occasion for the fact that Da-sein initially notices death at all. But,
remaining within the empirical certainty which we characterized, Da­
sein cannot become certain at all of death as it "is." Although in the
publicness of the they Da-sein seemingly "talks" only of this "empirical"
certainty of death,

258

basically it does not keep exclusively and primarily to
its death, everyday being­

those cases of death that merely occur.Evading

toward-the-end is indeed certain of death in another way than it itself
would like to realize in purely theoretical considerations. For the most
part, everydayness veils this from itself "in another way." It does not
dare to become transparent to itself in this way. We have already char­
acterized the everyday attunement that consists in an air of superiority
with regard to the certain "fact" of death-a superiority that is "anx­
iously" concerned while seemingly free of

Angst.

In this attunement,

everydayness acknowledges a "higher" certainty than the merely empir­
ical one. One

knows about the certainty of death,

and yet

"is"

not really

certain about it. The entangled everydayness of Da-sein knows about
the certainty of death, and yet avoids

being-certain.

But in the light of

what it evades, this evasion bears witness phenomenally to the fact that
death must be grasped as the ownmost nonrelational,

certain possibility

not-to-be-bypassed.
One says that death certainly comes, but not right away. With
this "but ... , the they denies that death is certain."Not right away" is
not a purely negative statement, but a self-interpretation of the they
with which it refers itself to what is initially accessible to Da-sein to take
care of. Everydayness penetrates to the urgency of taking care of things,
and divests itself of the fetters of a weary, "inactive thinking about
death." Death is postponed to "sometime later," by relying on the so­
called "general opinion." Thus the they covers over what is peculiar to
the certainty of death,

that it is possible in every moment. Together with the
indefiniteness of its when. Everyday being­

certainty of death goes the

toward-death evades this indefiniteness by making it something defi­
nite. But this procedure cannot mean calculating when the demise is due

Being and Time

11.1

239

to arrive. Da-sein rather flees from such definiteness. Everyday taking
care of things makes definite for itself the indefiniteness of certain death
by interposing before it those manageable urgencies and possibilities of
the everyday matters nearest to us.
But covering over this indefiniteness also covers over certainty.
Thus the ownmost character of the possibility of death gets covered
over: a possibility that is certain, and yet indefinite, that is, possible at
any moment.
Now that we have completed our interpretation of the everyday
talk of the they about death and the way death enters Da-sein, we have
been led to the characteristics of certainty and indefiniteness. The full
existential and ontological concept of death can now be defined as fol­
lows: As the end of Da-sein, death is the uum:most nonrelationa� certain, and, as
such, indefinite and not to be bypassed possibility of Da-sein. As the end of Dasein,

death is in the being of this being-toward-its-end

.

The delineation of the existential structure of being-toward-the­
end helps us to develop a kind of being of Da-sein in which it can be

wholly as Da-sein. The fact that even everyday Da-sein is always already
toward its end, that is, is constantly coming to grips with its own death,
even though "fleetingly," shows that this end, which concludes and
defines being-whole, is not something which Da-sein ultimately arrives at
only in its demise. In Da-sein, existing toward its death, its most extreme
not-yet which everything else precedes is always already included. So if
one has given an ontologically inappropriate interpretation of the not-yet
of Da-sein as something outstanding, any formal inference from this to
the lack of totality of Da-sein will be incorrect.

The phenomenon of the
not1et has been taken from the ahead-ofitself; no more than the structure of care
in genera� can it seroe as a higher court that would rule against a possible, exis­
tent wholeness; indeed, this ahead-ofitself first makes possible such a being­
toward-the-end. The problem of the possible wholeness of the being which
we ourselves actually are exists justifiably if care, as the fundamental
constitution of Da-sein, "is connected" with death as the most extreme
possibility of this being.
Yet it remains questionable whether this problem has been as yet
adequately developed. Being-toward-death is grounded in care. As

thrown being-in-the-world, Da-sein is always already delivered over to its
death. Being toward its death, it dies factically and constantly as long as
it has not reached its demise. That Da-sein dies factically means at the
same time that it has always already decided in this or that way in its
being-toward-death. Everyday, entangled evasion

this authentic being-toward-death has not been set forth and ontologi­
cally determined, there is something essentially lacking in our existential
interpretation of being-toward-the-end.
Authentic being-toward-death signifies an existentiell possibility
of Da-sein.This ontic potentiality-of-being must in its tum be ontologi­
cally possible. What are the existential conditions of this possibility?
How are they themselves to become accessible?

53. Existential Project of an Authentic Being-toward-Death
Factically, Da-sein maintains itself initially and for the most part in an
inauthentic being-toward-death.How is the ontological possibility of an

authentic being-toward-death to be characterized

"objectively," if, in the

end, Da-sein is never authentically related to its end, or if this authentic
being must remain concealed from others in accordance with its mean­
ing? Is not the project of the existential possibility of such a questionable
existentiell potentiality-of-being a fantastical undertaking? What is
needed for such a project to get beyond a merely poetizing, arbitrary
construction? Does Da-sein itself provide directives for this project? Can
the grounds for its phenomenal justification be taken from Da-sein
itself? Can our analysis of Da-sein up to now give us any prescriptions for
the ontological task we have now formulated, so that what we have
before us can be kept on a secure path?
The existential concept of death has been established, and thus
we have also established that to which an authentic being-toward-the-end
should be able to relate itself. Furthermore, we have also characterized
inauthentic being-toward-death and thus we have prescribed how
authentic being-toward-death cannot be in a negative way. The existen­
tial structure of an authentic being-toward-death must let itself be pro­
jected with these positive and prohibitive instructions.
Da-sein is constituted by disclosedness, that is, by attuned under­

cannot evade its ownmost non­

constitutive for it as an understanding of death-in the sense of being
toward this possibility without fleeing it or covering it over.

II. I

Being and Time

24 1

First of all, we must characterize being-toward-death as a being

toward a possibility,

261

toward an eminent possibility of Da-sein itself. Being

toward a possibility, that is, toward something possible, can mean to be
out for something possible, as in taking care of its actualization.In the
field of things at hand and objectively present, we constantly encounter
such possibilities: what is attainable, manageable, viable, and so forth.
Being out for something possible and taking care of it has the tendency
of

annihilating the possibility

of the possible by making it available. The

actualization of useful things at hand in taking care of them (producing
them, getting them ready, readjusting them, etc.), is, however, always
merely relative, in that what has been actualized still has the character of
being relevant. Even when actualized, as something actual it remains
possible for ... , it is characterized by an in-order-to. Our present analysis should simply make clear how being out for something and taking
care of it, is related to the possible. It does so not in a thematic and the­
oretical reflection on the possible as possible, or even with regard to its
possibility as such, but rather in such a way that it

circumspectly

looks

away from the possible to what it is possible for.
Evidently being-toward-death, which is now in question, cannot
have the character of being out for something and taking care of it with
a view toward its actualization. For one thing, death as something pos­
sible is not a possible thing at hand or objectively present, but a possi­
bility-of-being of

Da-sein.

Then, however, taking care of the actualiza­

tion of what is thus possible would have to mean bringing about one's
own demise. Thus Da-sein would precisely deprive itself of the very
ground for an existing being-toward-death.
Thus if being-toward-death is not meant as an "actualization" of
death, neither can it mean to dwell near the end in its possibility. This
kind of behavior would amount to "thinking about death," thinking
about this possibility, how and when it might be actualized.Brooding
over death does not completely take away from it its character of possi­
bility. It is always brooded over as something coming, but we weaken it
by calculating how to have it at our disposal.As something possible,
death is supposed to show as little as possible of its possibility.On the
contrary, if being-toward-death has to disclose understandingly the pos­
sibility which we have characterized as

such,

then in such being-toward­

death this possibility must not be weakened, it must be understood as

possibility,

cultivated

as possibility, and endured as possibility in our relation

to it.
However, Da-sein relates to something possible in its possibility, by

expecting it. Anyone who is intent on something possible, may encounter
it unimpeded and undiminished in its "whether it comes or not, or
whether it comes after all. " But with this phenomenon of expecting has

262

242

Being and Time

II. I

our analysis not reached the same kind of being toward the possible
which we already characterized as being out for something and taking
care of it? To expect something possible is always to understand and
"have" it with regard to whether and when and how it will really be
objectively present. Expecting is not only an occasional looking away
from the possible to its possible actualization, but essentially a

that actualization.

waitingfor

Even in expecting, one leaps away from the possible

and gets a footing in the real.It is for its reality that what is expected is
expected. By the very nature of expecting, the possible is drawn into the
real, arising from it and returning to it.
But being toward this possibility, as being-toward-death, should
relate itself to that death so that it reveals itself, in this being and for it, as

poss ibility. Terminologically, we shall formulate this being toward possi­
bility as anticipation of this possibility. But does not this mode of behavior
contain an approach to the possible, and does not its actualization
emerge with its nearness? In this kind of coming near, however, one
does not tend toward making something real available and taking care of
it, but as one comes nearer understandingly, the possibility of the pos­

The nearest nearness of being-toward-death as
possibility is as far removed as possible from anything real. The more clearly
sible only becomes "greater."

this possibility is understood, the more purely does understanding pen­
etrate to it as

the poss ibility of the impossibility of existence in general.

As

possibility, death gives Da-sein nothing to "be actualized" and nothing
which it itself could

be

as something real. It is the possibility of the

impossibility of every mode of behavior toward ..., of every way of
existing. In running ahead to this possibility, it becomes "greater and
greater," that is, it reveals itself as something which knows no measure at
all, no more or less, but means the possibility of the measureless impos­
sibility of existence. Essentially, this possibility offers no support for
becoming intent on something, for "spelling out" the real thing that is
possible and so forgetting its possibility. As anticipation of possibility,
being-toward-death first

makes this

possibility possible and sets it free as

possibility.
Being-toward-death is the anticipation of a potentiality-of-being of

that being whose kind of

being is anticipation itself.In the anticipatory

revealing of this potentiality-of-being, Da-sein discloses itself to itself
with regard to its most extreme possibility.But to project oneself upon
one's ownmost potentiality of being means to be able to understand

263

oneself in the being of the being thus revealed: to exist. Anticipation
shows itself as the possibility of understanding one's
extreme potentiality-of-being, that is, as the possibility of

Its ontological constitution must be made visible by setting forth

the concrete structure of anticipation of death. How is the phenomenal

243

definition of this structure to be accomplished? Evidently by defining the
characteristics of anticipatory disclosure which must belong to it so that
it can become the pure understanding of the owiunost nonrelational
possibility not-to-be-bypassed which is certain and, as such, indefinite.
We must remember that understanding does not primarily mean staring
at a meaning, but understanding oneself in the potentiality-of-being that
reveals itself in the project. 17
Death is the

ownmost possibility of Da-sein. Being toward it dis­
ownmost potentiality-of-being in which it is con­

closes to Da-sein its

cerned about the being of Da-sein absolutely. Here the fact can become
evident to Da-sein that in the eminent possibility of itself it is torn away
from the they, that is, anticipation can always already have torn itself
away from the they. The understanding of this "ability," however, first
reveals its facticallostness in the everydayness of the they-self.
The ownmost possibility is

nonrelational.

Anticipation lets Da-sein

understand that it has to take over solely from itself the potentiality-ofbeing in which it is concerned absolutely about its ownmost being.
Death does not just "belong" in an undifferentiated way to one's own
Da-sein, but it

lays claim

on it as something

individual.

The nonrela-

tional character of death understood in anticipation individualizes Dasein down to itself. This individualizing is a way in which the "there" is
disclosed for existence. It reveals the fact that any being-together-with
what is taken care of and any being-with the others fails when one's
ownmost potentiality-of-being is at stake. Da-sein can

itself only

authentically

be

when it makes that possible of its own accord. But if taking

care of things and being concerned fail us, this does not, however, mean
at all that these modes of Da-sein have been cut off from its authentic
being a self. As essential structures of the constitution of Da-sein they
also belong to the condition of the possibility of existence in general. Dasein is authentically itself only if it projects itself, as being-together with
things taken care of and concernful being-with . . . , primarily upon its
ownmost potentiality-of-being, rather than upon the possibility of the
they-self. Anticipation of its nonrelational possibility forces the being
that anticipates into the possibility of taking over its ownmost being of its
own accord.
The ownmost nonrelational possibility is

not to be bypassed.

Being

toward this possibility lets Da-sein understand that the most extreme
possibility of existence is imminent, that of giving itself up. But antici­
pation does not evade the impossibility of bypassing death, as does inau­
thentic being-toward-death, but frees itself for it. Becoming free for one's
own death in anticipation frees one from one's lostness in chance pos­
sibilities urging themselves upon us, so that the factical possibilities lying
before the possibility not-to-be-bypassed can first be authentically under-

264

244

stood and chosen. Anticipation discloses to existence that its extreme
inmost possibility lies in giving itself up and thus shatters all one's cling­
ing to whatever existence one has reached. In anticipation, Da-sein
guards itself against falling back behind itself, or behind the potentiality­
for-being that it has understood. It guards against "becoming too old for
its victories" (Nietzsche). Free for its ownmost possibilities, that are
determined by the

end,

and so understood as finite, Da-sein prevents

the danger that it may, by its own finite understanding of existence, fail
to recognize that it is getting overtaken by the existence-possibilities of
others, or that it may misinterpret these possibilities, thus divesting
itself of its owrunost factical existence. As the nonrelational possibility,
death individualizes, but only, as the possibility not-to-be-bypassed, in
order to make Da-sein as being-with understand the potentialities-of­
being of the others. Because anticipation of the possibility not-to-be­
bypassed also disclosed all the possibilities lying before it, this anticipa­
tion includes the possibility of taking the

whole of Da-sein in advance in
whole potential­

an existentiell way, that is, the possibility of existing as a

ity-ofbeing.
The ownmost nonrelational possibility not-to-be-bypassed is

tain.

The mode

of being

cer­

certain of it is determined by the truth (dis­

closedness) corresponding to it. But Da-sein discloses the certain possi­
bility of death as possibility only by making this possibility as its owrunost
potentiality-of-being possible in anticipating it. The disclosedness of this
possibility is grounded in a making possible that anticipates. Holding
oneself in this truth, that is, being certain of what has been disclosed,
lays claim all the more upon anticipation. The certainty of death cannot
be calculated in terms of ascertaining cases of death encountered. This
certainty by no means holds itself in the truth of something objectively
present. When something objectively present has been discovered, it is
encountered most purely by just looking at it and letting it be encoun­
tered in itself. Da-sein must first have lost itself in the factual circum-

265

stances (this can be one of care's own tasks and possibilities) if it is to
gain the pure objectivity, that is, the indifference of apodictic evidence.
If being-certain in relation to death does not have this character, that
does not mean it is of a lower grade, but that

it does not belong at all to the
order of degrees of evidence about things objectively present.
Holding death for true (death is always just one's own) shows a dif­
ferent kind of certainty, and is more primordial than any certainty

related to beings encountered in the world or to formal objects, for it is
certain of being-in-the-world. As such, it claims not only

one

definite

kind of behavior of Da-sein, but claims Da-sein in the complete authen­
ticity of its existence.18 In anticipation, Da-sein can first make certain of
its ownmost being in its totality not-to-be-bypassed. Thus, the evidence of

II. I

Being and Time

245

th e immediate givenness of experiences, of the ego or of conscious­
ness, necessarily has to lag behind the certainty contained in anticipa­
tion. And yet this is not because the kind of apprehension belonging to
it is not sUict enough, but because at bottom it cannot hold for true (dis­
closed) something that it basically insists upon "having there" as true:
namely, the Da-sein which I myself

am

and can be as potentiality-of­

being authentically only in anticipation.
The ownmost nonrelational possibility not-to-be-bypassed is

nite with regard to its certainty. How does anticipation

indefi­

disclose this char­

acter of the eminent possibility of Da-sein? How does understanding,
anticipating, project itself upon a definite potentiality-of-being which is
constantly possible in such a way that the when in which the absolute
impossibility of existence becomes possible remains constantly indefi­
nite? In anticipating the indefinite certainty of death, Da-sein opens itself
to a constant

threat

arising from its own there. Being-toward-the-end

must hold itself in this very threat, and can so little phase it out that it
rather has to cultivate the indefiniteness of the certainty. How is the gen­
uine disclosing of this constant threat existentially possible? All under­
standing is attuned. Mood brings Da-sein before the thrownness of its
"that-it-is-there."19

But the attunement which is able to hold open the constant
and absolute threat to itself arisingfrom the ownmost individualized being ofDasein is Angst.20 In Angst, Da-sein fmds itselffaced with the nothingness of
the possible impossibility of its existence. Angst is anxious about the poten­
tiality-of-being of the being thus determined, and thus discloses the most
extreme possibility. Because the anticipation of Da-sein absolutely indi­
vidualizes and lets it, in this individualizing of itself, become certain of the
wholeness of its potentiality-of-being, the fundamental attunement of

Angst belongs

to this self-understanding of Da-sein in terms of its ground.

Being-toward-death is essentially

Angst. *

This is attested unmistakably,

although " only" indirectly, by being-toward-death as we characterized it,
when it distorts

Angst

into cowardly fear and, in overcoming that fear,

only makes known its own cowardliness in the face of Angst.
What is characteristic about authentic, existentially projected being­
toward-death can be summarized as follows: Anticipation reveals

to Da-sein
its lostness in the they-self, and brings itface to face with the possibility to be itself,
primarily unsupported by concern taking care of things, but to be itself in pas­
sionate anxious freedom toward death which isfree of the illusions of the they,
factica� and certain of itself.
All relations, belonging to being-toward-death, to the complete
content of the most extreme possibility of Da-sein, constitute an antici-

266

Being and Time

11.1

pation that they combine in revealing, unfolding, and holding fast, as
that which makes this possibility possible. The existential project in
which anticipation has been delimited, has made visible the

ontological

possibility of an existentiell, authentic being-toward-death. But with this,
the possibility then appears of an authentic potentiality-for-being-a­
whole

but only as an ontological possibility.

-

Of course, our existential pro­

ject of anticipation stayed with those structures of Da-sein gained earlier
and let Da-sein itself, so to speak, project itself upon this possibility,
without proffering to Da-sein the "content" of an ideal of existence
forced upon it "from the outside." And yet this existentially "possible"
being-toward-death remains, after all, existentielly a fantastical demand.
The ontological possibility of an authentic potentiality-for-being-a-whole
of Da-sein means nothing as long as the corresponding ontic potentiality­
of-being has not been shown in terms of Da-sein itself. Does Da-sein
ever project itself factically into such a being-toward-death? Does it even

demand,

on the basis of its ownmost being, an authentic potentiality of

being which is determined by anticipation?

267

Before answering these questions, we must investigate to what
extent

at all and in what way Da-sein bears witness to a possible authenticity

of its existence from its ownmost potentiality-of-being, in such a way
that it not only makes this known as

existentielly possible,

but demands it

of itself.
The question hovering over us of an authentic wholeness of Da­
sein and its existential constitution can be placed on a viable, phenom­
enal basis only if that question can hold fast to a possible authenticity of
its being attested by Da-sein itself. If we succeed in discovering phe­
nomenologically such an attestation and what is attested to in it, the
problem arises again of whether the anticipation of death projected up to
now only in its ontological possibility has an essential connection with that
authentic potentiality-ofbeing attested to.

II
The Attestation of Da-sein of an
Authentic Potentiality-ofBeing,
and Resoluteness

54. The Problem of the Attestation of an Authentic Existentiell Possibility
We are looking for an authentic potentiality-of-being of Da-sein that is
attested by Da-sein itself in its existentiell possibility. First of all , we have
to find this attestation i tself. * If it is to "give Da-sein to understand"
itself in its possible authentic existence, it will have its roots in the being
of Da-sein. The phenomenal demonstration of such an attestation thus
contains the evidence of its origin from the constitution of being of Da­
sein.
The attestation is to give us to understand an authentic potentiality­
of-being-one s-self. With the expression "self," we answered the question of
the who ofDa-sein.1 The selfhood of Da-sein was defmed formally as a way
of existing, that is, not as a being objectively present. I myself am not for
the most part the who of Da-sein, but the they-self is. Authentic being-a­
self shows itself to be an existentiell modification of the they which is to
b e defined existentially.2 What does this modification imply, and what
are the ontological conditions of its possibility?
With the lostness in the they, the nearest, factical potentiality-ofbeing of Da-sein has always already been decided upon-tasks, rules,

standards, the urgency and scope of being-in-the-world, concerned and
taking care of things. The they has always already taken the apprehen­
sion of these possibilities-of-being away from Da-sein. The they even
conceals the way it has silently disburdened Da-sein of the explicit

choice

of these possibilities. It remains indefinite who is "really" choosing. So
Da-sein is taken along by the no one, without choice, and thus gets
caught up in inauthenticity. This process can be reversed only in such a
way that Da-sein explicitly brings itself back to itself from its lostness in
the they. But this bringing-back must have

first and foremost, its authentic poten­

tiality-of-being. *
But because Da-sein is lost in the "they," i t must first find itself. In
order to find

itself at

all, it must be "shown" to itself in its possible

authenticity. In terms of its possibility, Da-sein

is already a potentiality-for­

being-its-self, but it needs to have this potentiality attested.
In the following interpretation, we shall claim that this potentiality
is attested by that which, in the everyday interpretation of itself, Da­
sein is familiar to us as the

" voice of conscience. "3 That the

very "fact" of

conscience has been disputed, that its function as a higher court for
Da-sein's existence has been variously assessed, and that "what con­
science says" has been interpreted in manifold ways-all this might only
mislead us into dismissing this phenomenon if the very "doubtfulness"
of this fact-or of the way in which it has been interpreted-did not pre­
cisely prove that here a primordial phenomenon of Da-sein lies before us.
In the following analysis, conscience will be taken as something which we
t
have in advance thematically, and it will be investigated in a purely
existential manner, with fundamental ontology as our aim.
We shall first trace conscience back to its existential foundations

269

and structures and make it visible as a phenomenon of Da-sein, holding
fast to what we have hitherto arrived at as that being's constitution of
being. The ontological analysis of conscience started in this way is prior
to any psychological description and classification of experiences of
conscience, just as it lies outside any biological "explanation," that is, dis­
solution of this phenomenon. But it is no less distant from a theological

t

11.11

exegesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon for
proofs of God's existence or an "immediate" consciousness of God.
Still, in our restricted inquiry into conscience, we must neither
exaggerate its importance nor make distorted claims about it and lessen
its worth. As a phenomenon of Da-sein, conscience is not a fact that
occurs and is occasionally objectively present. It

"is" only in

the kind of

being of Da-sein and makes itself known as a fact only in factical exis­
tence. The demand for an "inductive, empirical proof' for the "factual­
ity" of conscience and for the legitimacy of its "voice" is based on an
ontological distortion of the phenomenon. But this distortion is also
shared by every superior critique of conscience as something that occurs
only at times rather than as a "universally established and ascertainable
fact." The fact of conscience cannot be coupled with such proofs and
counter-proofs at all. That is not a lack, but only the sign of its ontolog­
ical character that is different from objectively present things in the sur­
rounding world.
Conscience gives us "something" to understand, it

discloses.

From

this formal characteristic arises the directive to take this phenomenon back
into the disclosedness of Da-sein. This fundamental constitution of the being
that we ourselves actually are is constituted by attunement, understanding,
falling prey, and discourse. A more penetrating analysis of conscience
reveals it as a call. Calling is a mode of discourse. The call of conscience has
the character of summoning Da-sein to its ownmost potentiality-of-being-a­
self, by summoning it to its ownmost quality of being a lack.4
But this existential interpretation is necessarily a far cry from everyday, ontic common sense, although it sets forth the ontological foundations of what the vulgar interpretation of conscience has always understood in certain limits and has conceptualized as a "theory" of conscience.
Thus our existential interpretation needs to be confirmed by a critique of
the vulgar interpretation of conscience. When this phenomenon has
been exhibited, we can bring out to what extent it bears witness to an
authentic potentiality-of-being of Da-sein. To the call of conscience there
corresponds a possible hearing. Understanding the summons reveals
itself as

wanting to have a conscience.

But in this phenomenon lies that

existentiell choosing of the choice of being-a-self which we are looking for
and which we call r�soluteness5 in accordance with its existential structure. Thus we have the divisions of the analyses of this chapter: the existential and ontological foundations of conscience (section 55); the character of conscience as a call (section 56); conscience as the call of care
(section 57); understanding the summons and being a lack (section 58);
the existential interpretation of conscience and the vulgar interpretation
of conscience (section 59); the existential structure of the authentic
potentiality-of-being attested to in conscience (section 60).

55. The Existential and Ontological Foundations* of Conscience
The analysist of conscience will start out with an undifferentiated fact
about this phenomenon, the fact that it somehow gives one to under­
stand something. Conscience discloses, and thus belongs to the scope of
the existential phenomena which constitute the

being of the there

as dis­

closedness.6 We have analyzed the most general s tructures of attune­
ment, understanding, discourse, and falling prey. If we put conscience in
this phenomenal context, this is not a matter of a schematic applica­
tion of the structures gained there to a particular "case" of the disclosure
of Da-sein. Rather, our interpretation of conscience will not only con­
tinue the earlier analysis of the disclosedness of the there, but will grasp
it more primordially with regard to the authentic being of Da-sein.
Through disclosedness, the being that we call Da-sein is in the pos­
sibility of being its there. It is there for itself, together with its world, initially
and for the most part in such a way that it has disclosed its potentiality-of­
being in terms of the "world" taken care of. The potentiality-of-being as
which Da-sein exists has always already given itself over to definite possi­
bilities. And this is the case because it is a thrown being, and its thrown­
ness is disclosed more or less clearly and penetratingly by being attuned.
Understanding belongs equiprimordially to attunement (mood) . In this
way Da-sein "knows"t where it stands, since it has projected itself upon
possibilities of itself, or, absorbed in the they, has let itself be given such
possibilities as are prescribed by its public interpretedness. But this pre­
scription is existentially possible through the fact that Da-sein as under-

27 1

standing being-with can listen§ to others. Losing itself in the publicness of
the they and its idle talk, itfails

to hear its own self in listening to the

they­

self. If Da-sein is to be brought back from this lostness of failing to hear
itself, and if this is to be done through itself, it must first be able to
find itself, to find itself as something that has failed to hear itself and
continues to do so in

listening

to the they. This listening must be

stopped, that is, the possibility of another kind of hearing that inter­
rupts that listening must be given by Da-sein itself. The possibility of
such a breach lies in being s ummo ned immediately. Da-sein fails to hear
itself, and listens to the they, and this listening gets broken by the call if

that call, in accordance with its character as call , arouses another kind of
h earing which, in relation to the hearing that is lost, has a character in
every way opposite. If this lost hearing is numbed by the "noise" of the
manifold ambiguity of everyday "new" idle talk, the call must call silendy,
unambiguously, with no foothold for curiosity.

What this gives us to under­

stand in calling is conscience.
We take calling as a mode of discourse. Discourse articulates intel­
ligibility. What is characteristic about conscience as a call is by no means
only an " image , " like the Kantian representation of conscience as a
court of justice. We must only not overlook the fact that vocal utter­
ance is not essential to discourse, and thus not for the call either. Every
speaking and "calling out" already presupposes discourse.' If the every­
day interpretation knows about a "voice" of conscience, it is thinking not
so much about an utterance, which can factically never be found, * but
"voice" is understood as giving-to-understand. In the tendency toward
disclosure of the call lies the factor of a jolt, of an abrupt arousal. t The
call calls from afar to afar. It reaches him who wants to be brought
back.t
But with this characterization of conscience, only the phenomenal
horizon for the analysis of its existential structure has been oudined. We
are not comparing this phenomenon with a call, but we are under­
standing it as discourse, in terms of the disclosedness constitutive for Da­
sein. Our reflection avoids from the very beginning the path which ini­
tially o ffers i ts elf for an i nterpre tation of conscience: one trace s
conscience back t o a faculty o f the soul, understanding, will, o r feeling,
or explains it as the product of a mixture of these. In view of a ph�­
nomenon such as conscience,§ what is ontologically and anthropologically inadequate about an unattached framework of classified facult!�s of
the soul or personal acts becomes painfully obvious.8

56. The Character of Conscience as a Call
To discourse belongs what is talked about in it. Discourse gives infor­
mation about something in a certain respect. It draws from what is thus
talked about what it actually says as this discourse, what is said as such. In
discourse as communication, this becomes accessible to the

What is what is talked about in the call of conscience, what is

summoned? Evidently Da-sein itself. This answer is just as incontestable

as it is indefinite. If the call had such a vague goal, it would still be an

occasion for Da-sein to pay heed to itself. But to Da-sein essentially

belongs the fact that it is disclosed to itself with the disclosedness of its

world, so that it always already understands itself. The call reaches Da-sein
in this always-already-understanding-itself in everyday, average taking
care of things. The call reaches the they-self of heedful being-with with
others.

And to what is one s ummonded? To one's

273

sein is,

can

oum self. Not to what Da-

do, and takes care of in everyday being-with-one-another, not

even to what has moved it, what it has pledged itself to, what it has let

itself be involved with. Understood in a worldly way for others and for

itself, Da-sein is passed

over in this call.

The call to the self does not take

the slightest notice of all this. Because only the

self of

the they-self is

summoned and made to hear, the they collapses. The fact that the call

passes over both

the they and the public interpretedness of Da-sein by no

means signifies that it has also not been

reached.

Precisely in passing over

the they, the call pushed it (adamant as it is about public recognition)

into insignificance. But, robbed of its refuge and this subterfuge by the

summons, the self is brought to itself by the call.

The they-self is summoned to the self. However, this is not the

self that can become an "object" for itself on which to pass judgment,

not the s elf that unres trainedly dissects its " inner life" with excited

curiosity, and not the self that stares "analytically" at states of the soul

and their backgrounds. The summ o ns of the self in the they-self does

not force it inwards upon itself so that it can close itself off from the

"external world." The call passes over all this and disperses it, so as to

summon solely the self which is in no other way than being-in-the-world.
But how are we to define

what is spoken

in this discourse?

What

does conscience call to the one summoned? Strictly speaking-nothing.

The call does not say anything, does not give any information about

events of the world, has nothing to tell. Least of all does it strive to
open a "conversation with itself' in the self which has been summoned.
"Nothing" is called

to the self which is summoned, but it is summoned to

itself, that is, to its ownmost potentiality-of-being. In accordance with its
tendency as call , the call does not mandate a " trial" for the self which has

been summoned, but as a summons to the ownmost potentiali�f-being­

a-self, it calls Da-sein forth (ahead-of-itself) to its most unique possibili­
ties .

The call is lacking any kind of utterance. It does not even come to

words, and yet it is not at all obscure and indefinite.

solely and constantly in the mode ofsilence.

Conscience speaks

Thus it not only loses none of its

Being and Time

11.11

253

perceptibility, but forces Da-sein thus summoned and called upon to
the reticence of itself. The fact that what is called in the call is lacking a
formulation in words does not shunt this phenomenon into the indefi-

274

niteness of a mysterious voice, but only indicates that the understanding
of "what is called" may not cling to the expectation of a communication
or any such thing.
What the call discloses is nevertheless unequivocal, even if it gets
interpreted in different ways in individual Da-sein in accordance with its
possibilities of being understood. Whereas the content of the call is
seemingly indefinite, the direction it takes is a sure one and is not to be
overlooked. The call does not need to search gropingly for someone
to be summoned, nor does it need a sign showing whether it is he who is
meant or not. "Deceptions" occur in conscience not by an oversight of
the call (a mis-calling) but only because the call is

heard in

such a way

that, instead of being understood authentically, it is drawn by the they­
self into a manipulative conversation with one's self and is distorted in its
character of disclosure.
We must remember that when we designate conscience as a call,
this call is a summons to the they-self in its self. As this summons, it is the
summons of the self to its potentiality-of-being-a-self, and thus calls Da­
sein forth to its possibilities.
But we shall not obtain an ontologically adequate interpretation of
conscience until we can clarify not only

who is called by the call, but
who calls, how the one who is summoned is related to the caller, how this
"relation" is to be grasped ontologically as a connection of being.

57. Conscience a.s the Call of Care
Conscience calls the self of Da-sein forth from its lostness in the they.
The self summoned remains indifferent and empty in its what. The call
passes over

what

Da-sein understands itself as initially and for the most

part in its interpretation in terms of taking care of things. And yet the
self is unequivocally and unmistakably reached. Not only is the call
meant for him who is summoned "without regard to his person," the
caller, too, remains in a striking indefiniteness. It not only fails to answer
questions about name, status, origin, and repute, but also leaves not
the slightest possibility of making the call familiar for an understanding
of Da-sein with a "worldly" orientation. On the other hand, it by no
means disguises itself in the call. The caller of the call-and this belongs
to its phenomenal character-absolutely distances any kind of becoming
familiar. It goes against its kind of being to be drawn into any consideration and talk. The peculiar indefiniteness and indefinability of the
caller are not nothing, but a positive distinction. It lets us know that the

275

254

Being and Time

11.11

caller uniquely coincides with summoning to . . . , that it wants to be

heard only

as

and not be chattered about any further. But is it then

such,

not suitable to the phenomenon to leave unasked the question of who

the caller is? Yes, for the e:xistentiell way of listening to the factical call of

conscience, but not for the existential analysis of the facticity of calling

and the e:xistentiality of hearing.

But is it at all necessary to keep raising explicitly the question of

who

is calling? Is this not answered for Da-sein just as unequivocally as

the question whom the call summons?

Da-sein calls itself in conscience.

This understanding of the caller may be more or less awakened in fac­

tically hearing the call . However, ontologically it is not enough to answer

that Da-sein is the caller and the one summoned

Da-sein is summoned,

at the same time. When
is it not "there" in another way from that in which

it does the calling? Is it perhaps the ownmost potentiality-of-being that
functions as the caller?

The call is precisely something that

we ourselves

have neither

planned nor prepared for nor willfully brought about. "It" calls, against
our expectations and even against our will. On the other hand, the call

without doubt does not come from someone else who is with me in the
world. The call s comes from me, and yet

over me.

These phenomenal findings are not to be explained away. They

were also taken as the point of departure for interpreting the voice of
conscience as an alien power entering Da-sein. Continuing in this direc­
tion of interpretation, one supplies an owner for the power thus local­

ized, or else one takes that p ower as person (God) making himself

known. Conversely, one tries to reject this interpretation of the caller as

the expression of an alien power and at the same time to explain con­
science away "biologically. " Both interpretations hastily pass over the

phenomenal findings. Such procedures are made easier by the unspo­
ken, but ontologically guiding dogmatic thesis that what

As opposed to this methodical has tiness , we want not only to

hold on to the phenomenal findings in general-the fact that the call ,

that this p h en o menon is here delineated ontologically as a phe-

offer the sole guideline for the interpretation of the kind of being of

Does our previous analysis of the constitution of the being of Da­

sein show a way of making ontologically intelligible the kind of being of

the caller, and thus also that of calling? The fact that the call is not

255

lo oking for the caller in a being unlike Da-sein. Da-sein, after all, always
exists factically. It is not an unattached self-projection, but its character
is determined by thrownness as a fact of the being that it is, and so

determined, it has always already been delivered over to existence, and

remains so constantly. But the facticity of Da-sein is essentially distin­

guished from the factuality of something objectively present. Existing Da­
sein does not encounter itself as something objectively present within

the world. But neither is thrownness attached to Da-sein as an inacces­

sible quality that is of no importance to its existence. As thrown, Da-sein

into existence.

It exists as a being that has to be as it is

That it factically is, might be concealed with regard to its why, but
"that-it-is" has itself been disclosed to Da-sein. The thrownness of

this being belongs to the disclosedness of the "there," and reveals itself

cons tantly in its actual attunement. Attunement brings Da-sein, more or

less explicitly and authentically, before its "that it is, and as the being that
it is, has to be as a potentiality-of-being. " But for the most part, mood

closes off thrownness.

Da-sein flees from thrownness to the alleviation

that comes with the supposed freedom of the they-self. We characterized
this flight as the flight from the uncanniness that fundamentally deter­

mines individualized b eing-in-the-world. Uncanniness reveals itself
authentically in the fundamental attunement of An�t, and, as the most

elemental disclosedness of thrown Da-sein, it confronts being-in-the­

world with the nothingness of the world about which it is anxious in the

itself in the ground of its uncanniness, were the caller of the call of conscience?
Nothing speaks against this, but all the phenomena that were set

forth up to now in characterizing the call e r and its calling speak for it.

In its who, the caller is definable by nothing "worldly. " It is Da-sein

in i ts uncanniness, primordially thrown being-in-the-world, as not-athome, the naked " that" in the nothingness of the world. The caller is
unfamiliar to the everyday they-self, it is something like an

alien voice.

What could be more alien to the they, lost in the manifold "world" of its

heedfulness, than the self individualized to itself in uncanniness thrown
into nothingness? "It" calls, and yet gives the heedfully curious ears

nothing to hear that could be passed along and publicly spoken about.

When the caller reaches him who

is s ummo ned, it does so with a cold assurance that is uncanny and by no
means obvious. Wherein lies the basis for this assurance, if not in the
fact that Da-sein, individualized to itself in its uncanniness, is absolutely
unmistakable to itself? What is it that takes away from Da-sein so radi­
cally the possibility of misunderstanding itself from some other direction
and failing to recognize itself, if not the abandonment in being delivered
over to itself?
Un c anniness is the fundamental kind of b eing-in-the-world,
although it is covered over in everydayness. Da-sein itself calls as con­
science from the ground of this being. The "it calls me" is an eminent
kind of discourse of Da-sein. The call attuned by

Angst first makes pos­

sible for Da-sein its project upon its ownm ost potentiality-of-being. The
call of conscience, existentially understood, first makes known what

was

simply asserted9 before: uncanniness pursues Da-sein and threatens its
self-forgetful lostness.
The statement that Da-sein is at the same time the caller and the
one summoned has now lost its empty formal character and its obvi­
ousness.

Conscience reveals itself as the call of care:

the caller is Da-sein,

anxious in thrownness (in its already-being-in . . . ) about its potentiality­
of-being. The one summoned is also Da-sein, called forth to its own­
most potentiality-of-being (its being-ahead-of-itself . . . ) . And what is
called forth by the summons is Da-sein, out of falling prey to the they

278

(already-being-together-with-the-world-taken-care-of . . . ). The call of con­
science, that is, conscience itself, has its ontological possibility in the
fact that Da-sein is care in the ground of i ts being.
Thus we need not resort to powers unlike Da-sein, especially since
recourse to these is so far from explaining the uncanniness of the call
that it rather annihilates it. In the end, does not the reason for the far­
fetched "explanations" of conscience lie in the fact that we have not
looked

long enough to establish our phenomenal findings as to the

call,

and have mutely presupposed Da-sein to be in some kind of ontological
determination or indetermination, whichever it may chance. Why should
we look to alien powers for information before we have made sure that
in starting our analysis we have not given too

low an

assessment of the

being of Da-sein, that is, as a harmless subj ect occurring somewhere,
endowed with personal consciousness?
And yet if the caller-who is "no one" viewed from the perspective
of the world-is interpreted as a power, this seems to be an unpreju­
diced recognition of something "objectively ascertainable. " But rightly
considered, this interpretation is only a flight from conscience, a way out
for Da-sein along which it slips away from the thin wall that separates the

Being and Time

11.11

257

they, so to speak, from the uncanniness of its being. This interpreta­
tion of conscience pretends to recognize the call in the sense of a "uni­

versally" binding voice that "does not speak jus t subjectively." Better
yet, this "universal" conscience gets exalted to a "world conscience, "

which still has the phenomenal character of an "it" and "no one," yet

which s peaks-there in the individual " subject"-as this indefinite some­
thing.

But what else is this "public conscience" than the voice of the they?

Da-sein can only get the dubious idea of a "world conscience"

bottom conscience is essentially

always mine,

because at

not only in the sense that

one's ownm ost potentiality-of-being is always summoned, but because
the call comes from the being that I myself always am .

With this interpretation of the caller, which sheerly follows the

phenomenal character of calling, the "power" of conscience is not dimin­

ished and made "merely subj ective." On the contrary, the inexorability

and unequivocal quality of the call thus first becomes free. The "objec­
tivity" of the summons thus is first justified when the interpretation

leaves it its "subjectivity" which, of course, denies the they-self its domi­
nance.

Still, this interpretation of conscience as the call of care will be

countered by the question of whether any interpretation of conscience

can stand up if it removes itself so far from "natural experience. " How is
conscience as that which

summons

us to our ownmost potentiality-of-

part,

Does conscience speak in so indefinite and

empty a way about our ownmost potentiality-of-being? Does it not rather

speak definitely and concretely in relation to failures and omissions

which have already occurred or which we intended? Does the alleged
summons come from a

"bad"

conscience or a

"good"

one? Does con­

science give us anything positive at all? Does it not function rather only
critically?

Such second thoughts are incontestably justified. We can demand

in any interpretation of conscience that " one" should recognize in it
the phenomenon in question, as it is experienced daily. But to do justice

to this demand does not mean that the vulgar, ontic understanding of

conscience must be recognized as the first court of appeal for an onto­

logical interpretation. But, on the other hand, the second thoughts we

are having are premature as long as the analysis of conscience to which
they pertain has not reached its goal. Up to now we have tried solely to
trace conscience

as a phenomenon of Da-sein back to

the ontological con­

stitution of this being. This served to prepare the task of making con­
science intelligible as

of-being.

But what conscience attests becomes completely definite only
when we have stated with sufficient clarity what quality the

authentic understanding

"following" the call is not an addition ann exed to the phenomenon of
conscience, a process that can either occur or else be lacking. The

plete

com­

experience of conscience can only be grasped from understanding

the summons together with it. If the caller and he who is s umm oned are
themselves at the same time one's own Da-sein, a definite kind of being of Da­
sein lies in any failure to hear the call or in a mishearing of oneself.
Viewed existentially, an unattached call from which "nothing ensues" is
an impossible fiction. "That

nothing ensues"

means something

positive

with regard to Da-sein.
Thus only an analysis of understanding the summons can lead to
an explicit discussion of what the

caU gives to understand.

But only with our

foregoing, general ontological characterization of conscience is the pos-

280

sibility given to comprehend existentially conscience's call of " guilty." All
interpretations and experiences of conscience agree that the "voice" of
conscience somehow speaks of "guilt."

58. Understanding the Summons, and Guilt
In order to grasp phenomenally what is heard in understanding the
summons, we shall take up this summons anew. Summoning the they­
self means calling forth the authentic self to its potentiality-of-being, as
Da-sein, that is, being-in-the-world taking care of things and being-with
others. The existential interpretation of that to which the call calls forth,
thus cannot define any concrete individual possibility of existence if it
understands itself correctly in its methodical possibilities and tasks .
What can b e established, and what seeks to get established, i s not what is
called in and to each particular Da-sein from an existentiell s tandpoint,
but what

belongs to the existential condition of the possibility

of the actual, fac­

ti cal and existentiell potentiality-of-being.
When the call is understood with an existentiell kind of hearing,
such understanding is the more authentic the more Da-sein hears and
understands

its

own being summoned in a nonrelational way, and the

less the meaning of the call gets distorted by what one says is proper and
valid. What lies essentially in the authenticity of understanding the sum­
mons? What is actually essentially

given

to understand in the call,

although not always factically understood?
We have already answered this question in our thesis that the call
"says"

nothing which

could be talked about, it does not give any infor­

mation about factual occurrences. The call directs Da-sein f01Ward
its potentiality-of-being, as a call

out of uncanniness.

The call er is indeed

Being and Time

11.11

259

indefinite, but where it calls from is not indifferent for the calling. Where
it comes from-the uncanniness of thrown individuation-is also call ed in
the calling, that is, is also disclosed. Where the call comes from in calling
forth to . . . is that to which it is called back. The call does not give us to
understand an ideal, universal potentiality-of-being; it discloses it as what
is actually individualized in that particular Da-sein. The disclosive char­
acter of the call has not been completely determined until we under­
stand it as a calling back that calls forth. Only if we are oriented toward
the call thus understood, may we ask

what it gives

to understand.

But is the question of what the call says not answered more easily
and certainly by the "simple" reference to what we generally hear or
fail to hear in any experience of conscience: namely, that the call
addresses Da-sein as "guilty" or, as in the warning conscience, refers to a
possible "guilt" or as a "good" conscience, confirms that one is " cons cious of no guilt"? If only this "guilty" experienced "universally" in
experiences and interpretations of conscience were not defined in such
completely different ways! And even if the meaning of this "guilty" could
be grasped in general agreement, the

existential concept

of this being-

guilty would still be obscure. However, when Da-sein addresses itself as
guilty, where should i ts idea of guilt be drawn from if not from the
interpretation of its own being? But the question arises again:

how we are guilty and what guilt means? The

who says

idea of guilt cannot be arbi-

trarily thought up and forced upon Da-sein. But if an understanding of
the essence of guilt is possible at all, this possibility must have been
sketched out in Da-sein beforehand. How are we to find that trace that
can lead to revealing this phenomenon? All ontological inquiries into
phenomena such as guilt, conscience, and death must start from what
everyday Da-sein "says" about them. Because its kind of being is entangled, the way Da-sein gets interpreted is for the most part

cally

inauthenti-

"oriented" and does not get at the "essence, " since the primor-

dially appropriate ontological kind of line questioning remains alien to
it. Whenever we see something wrongly, a directive as to the primordial
"idea" of the phenomenon is also revealed. But where do we get our criterion for the primordial, existential meaning of "guilty"? From the fact

that this "guilty" turns up as a predicate of the "I am . " Does what is

understood as " guilt" in inauthentic interpretation possibly lie in the
being of Da-sein as such, in such a way that it

is

also already guilty in that

it actually, factically exists .
Thus by invoking the "guilty" which everyone agrees that he hears,
one has not yet answered the question of the existential meaning of
what is called in the call. This must first be defined if we are to make
intelligible what the call of " guilty" means, and why and how it gets dis­
torted in its significance by everyday interpretation.

Everyday common sense initially takes "being guilty" in the sense
of "owing something," "having something on account. " One is supposed
to return something to the other which is due to him . 1bis "being guilty"
as

"having debts"

is a way of being-with with others in the field of taking

care of things, as in providing something or bringing it along. Further
modes of taking care of things are depriving, borrowing, withholding,
taking, robbing, that is, in some way not doing justice to the claims that

282

the others have made as to their possessions. This kind of being guilty is
related to

things that can be taken care of

Then, being guilty has the further significance of

for,"

"being responsible

that is, being the cause or author of something or "being the occa­

sion" for something. In the sense of this "being responsible" for some­
thing, one can "be guilty" without "owing" anything to someone else or
corning to "owe" him. Conversely, one can owe something to another
without being responsible for it oneself. Another person can "incur
debts" to others "for me. "
These vulgar significations of being guilty as " having debts
with . . . " and "being responsible for . . . " can go together and determine
a kind of behavior which we call

"making oneself responsible,"

that is, by

having the responsibility for having a debt, one may break a law and
make oneself punishable. However, the requirement that one fails to sat­
isfy need not necessarily be related to possessions, it can regulate public
being-with-one-another in general. This definite "making oneself respon­
sible" by breaking a law can also at the same time have the character of

"becoming responsible to others." That does not occur by breaking a law as
such, but through my having the responsibility for the other's becoming
jeopardized in his existence, led astray, or even destroyed. This becom­
ing responsible to others is possible without breaking the "public" law.
The formal concept of being responsible in the sense of having become
responsible to others can be defined as

being the ground

for a lack in

the Da-sein of another, in such a way that this being-the-ground itself is
defined as "lacking" in terms of that for which it is the ground. This kind
of lacking is a failure to satisfy some demand placed on one's existing
being-with with others.
It remains a question how such demands arise and in what way
their character of demands and laws is to be conceived on the basis of
this origin. In any case,
"moral requirement" is a

being guilty in this latter sense of breaking a
kind of being of Da-sein. Of course, that is also

true of being guilty as "making oneself punishable, " as "having debts,"
and of any "having responsibility for. . . ". These, too, are modes of
behavior of Da-sein. Very little is said by grasping "burdened with moral
guilt" as a "quality" of Da-sein. On the contrary, it only thus becomes evi­
dent that this characterization is not sufficient for distinguishing onto-

11.11

Being and Time

261

logically between this kind o f "determination o f being" o f Da-sein and
the other ways of behaving just listed. The concept of moral guilt has

been so little clarified ontologically that when the idea of deserving pun-

283

ishment, or even having debts to someone, has also been included in this

concept, or when these ideas have been employed in the very defining of
it, such interpretations of this phenomenon could become prevalent

and have remained so. But in this way the "guilty" is again forced aside
into the area of taking care of things in the sense of calculating claims
and balancing them off.

The clarification of the phenomenon of guilt which is not neces­

sarily related to "having debts" and breaking the law, can be successful
only if we ask beforehand in principle about the

being guilty of Da-sein,
-

that is, if the idea of "guilty" is conceived in terms of the kind of being of

Da-sein.

For this purpose, the idea of "guilty" must be formalized to the

extent that the vulgar phenomena of guilt related to being-with others in
taking care of things are

excluded.

The idea of guilt must not only be

removed from the area of calculating and taking care of things, but

must also be separated from relationship to an ought and a law such that
by failing to comply with it one burdens himself with guilt. For here, too,
guilt is still necessarily defined as a

lack, when something which ought to

be and can be is missing. But to be missing means not being objectively
present. A lack, as the not being objectively present of what ought to be,

is a determination of being of obj ective presence. In this sense nothing
can be essentially lacking in existence, not because it is complete, but

because its character of being is distinguished from any kind of obj ective
presence.

Still, the quality of the

not is

present in the idea of "guilty." If the

"guilty" is to be able to define existence, the ontological problem arises

here of clarifying existentially the

not-quality

of this not. Furthermore,

there belongs to the idea of "guilty" what is expressed without differen­

tiation in the concept of guilt as "being responsible for" : being-the­

ground for . . . . Thus we define the formal existential idea of "guilty" as

being-the-ground for a being which is determined by a not-that is,

the-ground of a nullity.

If the idea of the

not

being­

present in the existentially

understood concept of "guilt" excludes relatedness to anyt11ing obj ec­
tively present which is possible or which ought to be, if thus Da-sein is

altogether incommensurable with something objectively present or valid

which it itself is not, or which is not in the way Da-sein is, that is,

exists,

so

any possibility that, with regard to being-the-ground for a lack, the being

that is itself such a ground might be calculated as "deficient, " is a possi­

bility that is excluded. If a lack, such as a failure to fulfill some requirement, has been "caused" in a way characteristic of Da-sein, we cannot

284

262

Being and Time

11.11

simply calculate back to a deficiency of the " cause. " Being the ground
for . . . need not have the s ame character of not as the

privativum

grounded in it and arising from it. The ground need not acquire a nul­
lity of its own from what is grounded in it. But this means that being­
guilty does not result from an indebtedness, but the other way around: indebt­
edness is possible only "on the basis " of a primordial being guilty. Can we
show this in the being of Da-sein, and how is it existentially possible at
all?
The being of Da-sein is care. It includes in itself facticity { thrown­
nes s ) , exis tence { proj ect) and falling prey. D a-sein exists as thrown,
brought into its there

not of its

own accord. It exists as a potentiality-of­

being which belongs to itself, and yet has

not given itself to

itself. Exist­

ing, it never gets back behind its thrownness so that it could ever
expressly release this "that-it-is-and-has-to-be" from

its being

a self and

lead it into the there. But thrownness does not lie behind it as an event
which actually occurred, something that happened to it and was again
separated from Da-sein. Rather, as long as it is,
" that" as care. As

this being,

Da-sein is

constantly its

delivered over to which it can exist uniquely

as the being which it is, it is,
being. Because it has

existing, the ground of its potentiality-of­
not laid the ground itself, it rests in the weight of it,

which mood reveals to it as a burden.
And how

is

Da-sein this thrown ground? Only by projecting itself

upon the possibilities into which it is thrown. The self, which as such has
to lay the ground of itself, can

never gain

power over that ground, and

yet it has to take over being the ground in existing. Being its own thrown
ground is the potentiality-of-being about which care is concerned.
B eing the ground, that is, existing as thrown, Da-sein constantly
lags behind its possibilities. It is never existent

before its ground, but
it and as it. Thus being the ground means never to gain power
over one's ownmost being from the ground up. This not belongs to the
existential meaning of thrownness. Being the ground, it itself is a nullity

onlyfrom

of itself. Nullity by no means signifies not being objectively present or
not subsisting, but means a not that constitutes this

being of Da-sein,

its

thrownness. The quality of this not as a not is determined existentially.

285

Being a self, Da-sein is the thrown being as self. Not through itself, but
released to itself from the ground in order to be as this ground. Da-sein is
not itself the ground of its being, because the ground first arises from its
own proj ect, but as a self, it is the

being

of its ground. The ground is

always ground only for a being whose being has to take over being-the­
ground_
Existing, Da-sein is its ground, that is, in such a way that it under­
stands itself in terms of possibilities and, thus understanding itself, is
thrown b eing. But this means that, as a potentiality-of-being, it always

II.II

Being and Time

263

stands in one possibility or another; it is constantly not other possibilities

and has relinquished them in its existentiell project. As thrown, the pro­

ject is not only determined by the nullity of being the ground but is
i tself as project essentially

null.

Again, this definition by no means signi­

fies the antic property of being "unsuccessful" or "of no value" but an
existential constituent of the structure of being of projecting. This nullity

belongs to the being-free of Da-sein for its existentiell possibilities. But
freedom

is

only in the choice of the one, that is, in bearing the fact of

not having chosen and not being able also to choose the others.

In the structure of thrownness as well as in that of the proj ect,

essentially lies a nullity. And it is the ground for the possibility of the nul­

lity of inauthentic Da-sein in its falling prey which it always already actu­

ally is fac tically.

Care itself is in its essence thoroughly permeated with nullity.

Care, the being of Da-sein, thus means, as thrown proj ect: being the

(null) ground of a nullity. And that means that Da-sein as such

is guilty if

our formal existential definition of guilt as being-the-ground of a nullity
is valid.

Existential nullity by no means has the character of a privation, of

a lack as compared with an ideal which is set up but is not attained in Da­
sein; rather, the being of this being is already null as project

before every­

thing that it can project and usually attains. Thus this nullity does not

occur occasionally in Da-sein, attached to it as a dark quality that it

could get rid of if it made sufficient progress .
Still, the

ontological meaning of the notness

of th i s existential nullity

remains obscure. But that is true also of the ontological

general.

essence of the not in

Of course, ontology and logic have expected much of the not,

and thus at times made its possibilities visible without revealing it itself

ontologically. Ontology found the not and used it. But is it then so selfevident that every not means a

negativum in the sense of a lack? Does its

positivity get exhausted by its constituting the " trans ition"? Why does

every dialectic take refuge in negation, without grounding it itself dialectically, without even being able to locate it as

a problem? Has anyone
ontological origin of notness a problem at all, or, before that,
even looked for the conditions on the basis of which the problem of the
ever made the

not and its notness and the possibility of this notness could be raised?

And where else should they be found

than in a thematic clarification of the

meaning of being in general?

The concepts of privation and lack which, moreover, are hardly

transparent, are insufficient for the . ontological interpretation of the

phenomenon of guilt, though if we take them formally enough, we can

put them to considerable use. Least of all , can we get nearer to the exis­

tential phenomenon of guilt by taking our orientation toward the idea of

evil, the

malum

as

privatio boni.

The

bonum

and the

privatio

have the

286

264

Being and Time

11 .11

same ontological provenance in the ontology of objective presence which

also characterizes the idea of "value" derived from that.

Beings whose being is care can not only burden themselves with

factical guilt, but they are guilty in the ground of their being. This being
guilty firs t gives the ontological condition for the fact that Da-sein can

become guilty while factically exis ting. This essential b eing guilty is,

equiprimordially, the existential condition of the possibility of the
"morally " good and evil, that is, for morality in general and its possible

factical forms. Primordial being guilty cannot be defined by morality
because morality already presupposed it for itself.

But what experience speaks for this primordial being-guilty of Da­

sein? Nor may we forget the counter-question: "is" guilt " there" only if a
consciousness of guilt is awakened, or does not the most primordial

being guilty make itself known in the very fact that guilt "is sleeping"?

The fact that this primordial being-guilty initially and for the most part
remains undisclosed and is kept closed off by the entangled· being of Da­

sein only reveals this nullity. Being guilty is more primordial than any
knowing about it. And only because Da-sein is guilty in the ground of its
being and closes itself off from itself as thrown and fallen prey, is con­

science possible, if indeed the call basically gives us to understand

being guilty .

this

The call is the call of care. Being guilty constitutes the being that we

2 87

call care. Da-sein stands primordially together with itself in uncanniness.

Uncanniness brings this being face to face with its undisguised nullity,

which belongs to the possibility of its ownmost potentiality-of-being. In

that Da-sein as care is concerned about its being, it calls itself as a they

that has factically fallen prey, and calls itself from its uncanniness to its

potentiality-of-being. The summons calls back by calling forth: forth to the
possibility of taking over in existence the thrown being that it is,

back

to

thrownn ess in order to understand it as the null ground that it has to take

up into existence. The calling back in which conscience calls forth gives

Da-sein to understand that Da-sein itself-as the null ground of its null

proj ect, standing in the possibility of its being-must bring itself back to
itself from its lostness in the they, and this means that it is guilty.

What Da-sein thus gives itself to understand would then, after all ,

be a knowledge about itself. And the hearing corresponding to that call

would be a

taking notice

of the fact of being "guilty." But if the call is

indeed to have the character of a summons, does not this interpretation

of conscience lead to a complete distortion of its function? Summoning
to being-guilty, is that not summoning to evil?

Even the most violent interpretation would not wish to impose

upon conscience such a meaning for the call. But then what is " sum­
moning to being-guilty" supposed to mean?

n.n

Being and Time

265

The meaning of the call becomes clear if our understanding of it

kee ps to the existential meaning of being-guilty, instead of making basic
th e derivative concept of guilt in the s ense of an indebtedness "arising"

fro m some deed done or left undone. Such a demand is not arbitrary if
the call of conscience, coming from Da-sein itself, is directed solely to
this being. But then summoning to being-guilty means a calling forth to

the potentiality-of-being that I always already am as Da-sein. Da-sein

need not first burden itself with "guilt" through failures or omissions; it
must only

be authentically

the "guilty" that it is.

Then the correct hearing of the summons is tantamount to under­

standing oneself in one's ownmost potentiality-of-being, that is, in pro­

jecting oneself upon one's

ownmost

authentic potentiality for becoming

guilty. When Da-sein understandingly lets itself be called forth to this

possibility, this includes its

becoming free for

the call: its readiness for

the potentiality-of-being summoned. Understanding the call,

It has chosen itself.

With this choice, Da-s ein makes possible i ts ownmost being-

guilty, which remains clos e d off from the they-self. The common
sense of the they knows only what is sufficient or insufficient wi th

its ownmost being-guilty so as to talk about mis takes all the more

but it is not a choosing of conscience, which as such cannot be cho-

sen. What is chosen is

Understanding the summons means: wanting to

have a conscience.

This does not mean wanting to have a "good conscience, " nor

does it mean willfully cultivating the "call"; it means solely the readi­

ness to be summoned. Wanting to have a conscience is just as far away

from searching out one's factical indebtedness as it is from the ten­
dency to

liberation from guilt in the sense of the essential "guilty."
Wanting to have a conscience is rather the most primordial existentiell pre­
supposition for the possibility of becoming factically guilty. Understanding
the call, Da-sein lets its ownmost self take action in itself in terms of its
chosen potentiality-of-being. Only in this way can it be responsible. But
fac tically every action is necessarily "without conscience, " not only

because it does not avoid factical moral indebtedness, but because on
the basis of the null ground of its null project it has always already

become gu ilty toward the others in being-with with them. Thus wanting
to have a conscience takes over the essential lack of conscience within

which alone there is the existentiell possibility of being "good."

288

266

289

Being and Time

11.11

Although the call does not give us any information, it is not merely
critical, but positive. It discloses the most primordial potentiality-of-being
of Da-sein as being-guilty. Thus, conscience reveals itself as an attestation
belonging to the being of Da-sein-an attestation in which conscience
call s Da-sein forth to its ownmost potentiality-of-being. Can the authen­
tic potentiality-of-being thus attested be defined existentially in a more
concrete way? But now that we have shown a potentiality-of-being that is
attested in Da-sein itself, a preliminary ques tion arises: can we claim
sufficient evidential weight for the way we have shown this as long as the
strange feeling of our interpreting conscience one-sidedly by tracing it
back to the constitution of Da-sein while hastily passing over all of the
findings familiar to the vulgar interpretation of conscience is one that is
still undiminished? Is the phenomenon of conscience still recognizable
at all, as it "really" is, in our interpretation? Have we not been all too
sure of ourselves in the ingenuousness with which we deduced an idea of
conscience from the constitution of being of Da-sein?
The last step in our interpretation of conscience is the existential
delimitation of the authentic potentiality-of-being that conscience attests.
If we are to assure ourselves of a way of access that will make such a step
possible even for the vulgar understanding of conscience, we need
explicit evidence for the connection between the results of the onto­
logical analysis and the everyday experiences of conscience.
59. The Existential Interpretation of Conscience

and the Vulgar Interpretation of Conscience
Conscience is the call of care from the uncanniness of being-in-the­
world that summons Da-sein to its ownmost potentiality-for-being-guilty.
We showed that wanting-to-have-a-conscience corresponded to under­
standing the summons. Both of these characterizations are not imme­
diately harmonious with the vulgar interpretation of conscience. Indeed,
they seem to be in direct conflict with it. We call this interpretation of
conscience vulgar because in characterizing this phenomenon and
describing its " function" it keeps to what they know as conscience, how
they follow it or fail to follow it;
But must the ontological interpretation be in harmony with the
vulgar interpretation at all? Should not the latter be, in principle, onto­
logically suspect? If Da-sein initially and for the most part understands
itself in terms of what it takes care of, and if it interprets all its modes of
behavior as taking care of things, then will there not be falling prey and
covering over in its interpretation of precisely the way of its being that, as
a call, seeks to bring it back from its lostness in the cares of the they?
Everydayness takes Da-sein as something at hand that is taken care of,

11.11

Being and Time

267

that is, is regulated and calculated. "Ufe" is a "business," whether or
not it covers its costs .
With regard t o the vulgar kind o f being o f Da-sein itself, there is
thus no guarantee that the interpretation of conscience arising from it or
the theories of conscience oriented toward it have attained the appro­
priate ontological horizon for its interpretations. Nevertheless, even the
vulgar experience of conscience must somehow get at the phenomenon,
pre-ontologically. Two things follow from this. On the one hand, the
everyday interpretation of conscience cannot be valid as the ultimate criterion for the "objectivity" of an ontological analysis. On the other hand,
such an analysis i s not justified in elevating its elf over the everyday
understanding of conscience and passing over the anthropological, psy­
chological, and theological theories of conscience based on it. If the
existential analysis has exposed the phenomenon of conscience in its
ontological roots, the vulgar interpretations must be intelligible precisely in terms of that analysis; where they miss the phenomenon and
why they cover it over. However, since in the context of problems in this
inquiry the analysis of conscience is only subservient to the ontological,
fundamental question, the characterization of the connection between
the existential interpretation of conscience and the vulgar interpretation
of conscience will have to be content with a reference to the essential
problems .
In this vulgar interpretation of conscience there are four objec­
tions to our interpretation of conscience as the summons of care to
being-guilty.

1 . Conscience has an essentially critical function.
2. Conscience always speaks relative to a definite deed that has been
done or wished for.

3 . According to experience, the "voice" is never related so radically to
the being of Da-sein.

4. Our interpretation pays no attention to the basic forms of the phe­
nomenon, to "evil" and "good" conscience, to what "reproves" and
"warns . "
Let u s begin our discussion with the las t reservation. I n all inter­
pretations of conscience, it is the "evil" or "bad" conscience that has
priority. Conscience is primarily "bad"; such a conscience makes known
to us that in every experience of conscience something like a "guilty"
gets experienced first. But in the idea of bad conscience how is this
making itself known of evil understood? The "experience of conscience"
turns up after the deed has been done or left undone. The voice fol­
lows up the transgression and points back to the event through which

290

II.n

Being and Time

268

Da-sein has burdened itself with guilt. If conscience makes known a

"being guilty," this cannot occur as a summons to . . . , but as a pointing

that reminds us of the guilt incurred.

But does the "fact" that the voice comes later prevent the call from

being basically a calling forth? The fact that the voice is grasped as a stir­
ring of conscience that follows

after is

not yet evidence for a primordial

understanding of the phenomenon of conscience. What if the factical

indebtedness were only the occasion for the fac tical calling of con­

science? What if the interpretation we described of "bad" conscience got

stuck halfway? That this is true can be seen from the ontological fore­
having within whose scope the phenomenon has been brought by this

29 1

interpretation. The voice is something that turns up, it has its place in

the series of objectively present experiences, and it follows after the
experience of the deed. But neither the call nor the past deed nor the

guilt assumed are events with the character of something objectively

present that runs its course. The call has the kind of being of care. In the

call, Da-sein "is" ahead of itself in such a way that at the same time it

directs itself back to its thrownness. Only by first positing that Da-sein is
a serial connection of successive experiences, is it possible to take the

voice as something coming afterwards, something later that necessarily

refers back. The voice does call back, but it calls back beyond the past
deed into thrown being-guilty, which is "earlier" than any indebtedness.

But the call back at the same time calls forth a

being-guilty,

as some­

thing to be s eized upon in one's own existence, in such a way that

authentic, existentiell

being-guilty precisely "comes after"

the call , and not

the other way around. Basically, bad conscience is so far from reproving

and pointing back that it rather points forward by calling back into

thrownness. The order of succession in which experiences run their course is not
valid for the phenomenal structure of existing.

If a characterization of "bad" conscience does not get at the pri­

mordial phenomenon, still less can this be done by characterizing the

good conscience, whether one takes it as an independent form of con­

science or as one essentially founded upon "bad" conscience. As the

"bad" conscience makes known a "being evil , " the good conscience

would have to make known the "being good" of Da-sein. One can easily
see that conscience that used to be the "effluence of the divine power"

now becomes the slave of Pharisaism. It is supposed to let men say of
themselves: "I am good." Who else can say this and who would be less

willing to affirm it than the good man himself? But from this impossible
consequence of the idea of good conscience, the fact only becomes

apparent that being-guilty is what conscience calls.

To escape this consequence, one has interpreted "good" con­

science

as

a privation of the "bad" one, and defined it as an "experi-

Being and Time

n.n

269

en ce d lack of bad conscience."10 Accordingly it would be an experience
of th e fact that the call does not tum up, that is, that I have nothing to
reproach myself with. But how is this "lack" "experienced"? The supposed
experience is not the experience of a call at all , but a making certain that
a deed attributed to Da-sein was not committed by it and that Da-sein is

therefore innocent. Becoming certain of not having done something does
not have the character of a phenomenon of conscience at all. On the
contrary, it can rather mean a forgetting of conscience, that is, that one
is emerging from the possibility of being able to be summoned. This
"certainty" contains the tranquillizing suppression of wanting to have a
conscience, that is, of understanding one's ownmost and constant beingguilty. "Good" conscience is neither an independent form of conscience
nor a founded form of conscience, that is, it is not a phenomenon of
conscience at all.
Since the talk about a "good" conscience arises from the experi­
ence of conscience of everyday Da-sein, the latter only betrays the fact
that basically it does not get at the phenomenon, even when it speaks of
"bad" conscience. For factically the idea of "bad" conscience is oriented
toward that of the "good" conscience. The everyday interpretation keeps
to the dimension of calculating and taking care of things and balancing
out "guilt" and "innocence." It is in this horizon that the voice of con­
science is " experienced."
In characterizing the primordiality of the ideas of a "bad" and a
"good" conscience, we have also already decided as to the distinction
between a conscience that points ahead and warns, and one that points
back and reproves . It is true that the idea of the warning conscience
comes nearest to the phenomenon of summoning to . . . . It shares with
the latter the character of pointing ahead. But this agreement is only an
illusion, after all. The experience of a warning conscience again sees
the voice only in orientation toward the will ed deed from which it wants
to deter us. As the suppression of what is wanted, the warning is thus
possible only because the " warning" call aims at the potentiality-of-being
of Da-sein, namely, at its understanding of itself in being-guilty in which
"what is wished for" first gets shattered. The warning conscience has the
fun ction of sporadically governing our staying free from indebtedness .
Th e experience o f a "warning" conscience sees the tendency of its call
only to the extent that it remains accessible to the common sense of
the they.
The third reservation appeals to the fact that the everyday experi­
ence of conscience

is not familiar with anything like a being summoned to

be guilty. This we must admit. But does the everyday experience of con­
science then guarantee that the complete possible content of the call of
the voice of conscience is heard in it? Does it follow from this that the

292

270

294

Being and Time

II.u

theories of conscience based on the vulgar experience of conscience
have secured for themselves the appropriate ontological horizon for
the analysis of the phenomenon? Does not rather an essential kind of
being of Da-sein, falling prey, show that this being initially and for the
most part understands itself ontically in terms of the horizon of taking
care of things, but ontologically defines being in the sense of objective
presence? But from this comes a twofold covering over of the phe­
nomenon: the theory sees a series of experiences or "psychic processes"
that are for the most part quite indefinite in their kind of being. Expe­
rience encounters conscience as a judge and an admonisher with whom
Da-sein calculatingly deals.
The fact that Kant takes the "idea of a court ofjustice" as the key
idea for the basis of his interpretation of conscience is not a matter of
chance, but was suggested by the idea of moral law, although his concept
of morality was far removed from utilitarianism and eudaemonism.
Even the theory of value, whether it be formally or materially conceived,
has a "metaphysics of morals, " that is, an ontology of Da-sein and exis­
tence as its unspoken ontological presupposition. Da-sein is conceived as
a being to be taken care of, and this taking care of has the meaning of
"actualizing values" or satisfying norms.
The appeal to the scope of what the everyday conscience is familiar
with as the sole higher court for the interpretation of conscience, cannot
be justified unless it has s topped to consider whether conscience can
become authentically accessible at all.
Thus the further objection that the existential interpretation over­
looks the fact that the call of conscience is always related to a definite
"actualized" or willed deed, also loses its force. It cannot be denied that
the call is frequently experienced as having such a tendency. It remains
questionable only whether this experience of the call lets it "proclaim"
itself fully. The commonsense interpretation might believe that it keeps
itself to "facts, " and yet in the end has restricted the call's scope of dis­
closure by its very common sense. As little as the "good" conscience
can be placed in the service of a "Pharisaism, " just as little may the func­
tion of the "bad" conscience be reduced to pointing out indebtednesses
that are objectively present or to repressing possible ones . As if Da-sein
were a "household" whose indebtedness only needed to be balanced
out in an orderly way for the self to be able to stand "next to" these
experiential occurrences as an uninvolved spectator.
But if what is primary in the call is not a relatedness to factically
"objectively present" guilt or culpable deeds that have been factically
willed, and if thus the "reproving" and "warning" types of conscience
express no primordial functions of the call, then the ground is also
taken out from under the feet of the first reservation, that the existential

II . I I

Being and Time

27 1

interpretation fails to recognize the "essentially" critical accomplishment
of conscience. This reservation, too, arises from a view of the phe­
nomenon which is genuine within certain limi ts . For, indeed, in the
content of the call, nothing can be shown that the voice "positively"
recommends and commands . But how is this positivity that is missing
from what conscience does to be understood? Does it follow from this
that conscience has a "negative" character?
We miss a "positive" content in what is calle d because we expect to be
told something actually useful about assured possibilities of "action " that are
available and calculable. This expectation is based on the horizon of inter­
pretation of the commonsense way of taking care of things, which forces
the existence of Da-sein to be subsumed under the idea of a govern­
able course of business. Such expectations (which also in part inexplicitly
underlie the demands of a material ethics of value as opposed to a
"merely" formal one) are, however, disappointed by conscience. Such
"practical" directions are not given by the call of conscience for the sole
reason that it summons Da-sein to existence, to its ownmost potentiality­
of-being-a-self. With its unequivocally calculable maxims that one is led
to expect, conscience would deny to existence nothing less than the pos­
sibility of acting. Because conscience evidently cannot be "positive" in
this way, neither does it function in the same way "only negatively."
The call discloses nothing that could be positive or negative as some­
thing to be taken care of, because it has to do with an ontologically com­
pletely different being, namely, existence. On the contrary, the correctly
understood call gives the "most positive thing of all" in the existential
sense-the ownmost possibility that Da-sein can give itself as a calling
back that calls it forth to its factical potentiality-of-being-a-self. To hear
the call authentically means to bring oneself to factical action. But only
by setting forth the existential structure implied in our understanding of
the summons when we hear it authentically, shall we attain a completely
adequate interpretation of what is called in the call.
We wanted to show how the phenomena that alone are familiar to
the vulgar interpretation of conscience, point back to the primordial
meaning of the call of conscience when they are understood in an onto­
logically appropriate way; then, that the vulgar interpr:etation arises
from the limitations of the entangled self-interpretation of Da-sein, and,
since falling prey belongs to care itself, we must show that this inter­
pretation, even though it is self-evident, is by no means accidental.
The ontological critique of the vulgar interpretation of conscience
could be subject to the misunderstanding that by showing the lack of
existential primordiality of the everyday experience of conscience one
wanted to pass judgment upon the existentiell "moral quality" of Da-sein.
Just as existence is not necessarily and directly jeopardized by an onto-

295

272

Being and Time

Il.n

logically insufficient understanding of conscience, the existentiell under­
standing of the call is not guaranteed by an existentially adequate inter­
pretation of conscience either. Seriousness is no less possible in the vul­
gar experience of conscience than is a lack of seriousness in a more
primordial understanding of conscience. Still, the existentially more pri­
mordial interpretation also discloses possibilities of a more primordial
existentiell understanding, as long as our ontological concepts do not get
cut off from ontic experience.
60. The Existential Structure of the Authentic

Potentiality-ofBeing Attested in Conscience

296

The existential interpretation of conscience is to set for an existent attes­
tation in Da-sein itself of its ownmost potentiality-of-being. Conscience
attests not by making something known in an undifferentiated way, but
by a summons that calls forth to being-guilty. What is thus attested to is
"grasped" in the hearing which understands the call without distortion in
the sense it has itself intended. Understanding the summons, as a mode
of being of Da-sein, first gives the phenomenal content of what is attested
in the call of conscience. We characterized authentically understanding
the call as wanting to have a conscience. Letting one's ownm ost self act
in itself of its own accord in its being-guilty represents phenomenally the
authentic potentiality-of-being attested in Da-sein itself. Its existential
structure must now be exposed. Only in this way can we penetrate to the
fundamental constitution, disclosed in Da-sein itself, of the authenticity of
its existence.
As self-understanding in one's ownmost potentiality of being, want­
ing-to-have-a-conscience is a mode of disclosedness of Da-sein. Disclosed­
ness is constituted by attunement and discourse as well as by under­
standing. Existentiell understanding means to project oneself upon
one's ownmost factical possibility of having the potentiality-for-being-in­
the-world. But the potentiality-of-being is understood only by existing in
this possibility.
What mood corresponds to such understanding? Understanding
the call discloses one's own Da-sein in the uncanniness of its individuation. The uncanniness revealed in understanding is genuinely disclosed
by the attunement of Angst belonging to it. The fact of the Angst of con­
science is a phenomenal confirmation of the fact that in understanding
the call Da-sein is brought face to face with its own uncanniness. Want­
ing to have a conscience becomes a readiness for Ang.5t.
The third essential element of disclosedness is discourse. The call
itself is a primordial discourse of Da-sein, but there is no corresponding
counter-discourse in which, for example, one talks about what con-

Being and Time

11.11

273

science has said and tries to deal wi th it. In hearing the call under­
standingly, one denies oneself any counter-discourse, not because one

has b een overcome by an "obscure power," which suppresses one's hear­
ing, but because this hearing appropriates the content of the call in an
unco vered way. The call introduces the fact of constantly being-guilty
an d thus brings the self back from the loud idle chatter of the they's

common sense. Thus the mode of articulative discourse belonging to
wan ting to have a conscience is reticence. We characterized silence as an
essential possibility of discourse.1 1 Whoever wants to give something to
understand in silence must "have something to say." In the summons,
Da-sein gives itself to understand its ownmost potentiality-of-being. Thus
this calling is a keeping silent.The discourse of conscience never comes
to utterance. Conscience only call s silently, that is, the call comes from
the s oundlessness of uncanniness and calls Da-sein thus summoned
back to the s tillness of itself, and calls it to become still. Wanting to
have a conscience thus understands this silent discourse appropriately
only in reticence. It takes the words away from the commonsense idle
chatter of the they.
The commonsense interpretation of conscience, which " s trictly

adheres to facts," takes the silent discourse of conscience as the occasion
to pass it off as something not ascertainable at all or objectively pre­
sent. The fact that

they, hearing and understanding only loud idle

chat­

ter, cannot "confirm" any call , is attributed to conscience with the excuse
that it is " dumb" and evidently not objectively present. With this inter­
pretation, the they only covers over its own failure to hear the call and
the fact that its "hearing" does not reach very far.
The disclosedness of Da-sein in wanting-to-have-a-conscience is
thus constituted by the attunement of Ang.5t, by understanding as pro­
jecting oneself upon one's ownm ost being-guilty, and by discourse as ret­
icence. We shall call the eminent, authentic disclosedness attested in
Da-sein itself by its conscience-the

reticent projecting oneself upon one s
ownmost being-guilty which is ready for Angst-resoluteness .
Resoluteness is an eminent mode of the disclosedness of Da-sein.

But in an earlier passage dis closedness was interpreted existentially12 as
This is not primarily a quality of '1udgment" or of any
p articular mode of behavior at all, but an essential constituent of being­

primordial truth.

in-the-world as such. Truth must be understood as a fundamental exis­
tential. Our ontological clarification of the statement that " Da-sein is

in the truth" has pointed to the primordial disdosedness of this being as
the

truth of existence;

and for its delineation we have referred to the anal­

ysis of the authenticity of Da-sein. 1�
Now, in resoluteness the most primordial truth of Da-sein has
been reached, because it is

authentic.

The disclosedness of the there dis-

297

274

298

Being and Time

11. 11

closes equiprimordially the whole of being-in-the-world-the world,
being-in, and the self that is this being as "I am." With the disclosedness
of world, innerworldly beings have always already been discovered. The
discoveredness of things at hand and objectively present is grounded in
the discoveredness of the world; 14 for if the actual totality of relevance of
things at hand is to be freed, this requires a pre-understanding of sig­
nificance. In understanding significance, Da-sein, taking care of things,
is circumspectly referred to the things at hand encountered. The under­
standing of significance as the disclosedness of the actual world is again
grounded in the understanding of the for-the-sake-of-which, to which dis­
covering of the totality of relevance goes back. In seeking shelter, sus­
tenance, and livelihood, we do so for-the-sake-of the constant possibilities
of Da-sein that are near to it; upon these, this being which is concerned
about its being has always already projected itself. Thrown into its
"there," Da-sein is always factically dependent on a definite "world"-its
"world. " At the same time those nearest factical projects are guided by
the lostness in the they taking care of things. This lostness can be sum­
moned by one's own Da-sein, the summons can be understood in the
mode of resoluteness . But authentic disclosedness then modifies equip­
.
rimordially the discoveredness of "world" grounded in it and the dis­
closedness of being-with with others. The "world" at hand does not
become different as far as "content, " the circle of the others is not
exchanged for a new one, and yet the being toward things at hand which
understands and takes care of things, and the concerned being-with
with the o thers is now defined in terms of their owrun ost potentiality-of­
being-a-self.
As authentic being a self, resoluteness does not detach Da-sein from
its world, nor does it isolate it as free floating ego. How could it, if res­
oluteness as authentic disclosedness is, after all, nothing other than
authentically being-in-the-world? Resoluteness brings the self right into its
being together with things at hand, actually taking care of them, and
pushes it toward concerned being-with with the others.
In the light of the for-the-sake-of-which of the potentiality-of-being
which it has chosen, resolute Da-sein frees itself for its world. The reso­
luteness toward itself first brings Da-sein to the possibility of letting the
others who are with it "be" in their ownmost potentiality-of-being, and
also discloses that potentiality in concern which leaps ahead and frees.
Resolute Da-sein can become the "conscience" of others. It is from the
authentic being a self of resoluteness that authentic being-with-one­
another first arises, not from ambiguous and jealous stipulations and
talkative fraternizing in the they and in what they wants to undertake.
In accordance with its ontological essence, resoluteness always
belongs to a factical Da-sein. The essence of this being is its existence.

Being and Time

11.11

275

Resoluteness " exists" only as a resolution that proj ects itself under­

standingly. But to what does Da-sein resolve itself in resoluteness? On

what is it to resolve?

Only

the resolution itself can answer this. It would

be a complete misunderstanding of the phenomenon of resoluteness if
one were to believe that it is simply a matter of receptively taking up pos­

sibilities presented and suggested. Resolution

is precisely the disclosive pro­
jection and determination of the actualfactical poss ibility. The indefiniteness

that characterizes every factically projected potentiality-of-being of Da­
sein

belongs

necessarily to resoluteness. Resoluteness is certain of itself

only in a resolution. But the

existentiell indefiniteness

of resoluteness

never makes itself definite except in a resolution; it nevertheless has its

existential definiteness.

What one resolves upon in resoluteness is prefigured ontologi­

cally in the existentiality of Da-sein in general as a potentiality-of-being in
the mode of heedful concern. But, as care, Da-sein is determined by

facti city and falling prey. Disclosed in its " there," it stays equiprimor­

dially in truth and in untruth.15 This "really" is true in particular for resoluteness as authentic truth. Thus resoluteness appropriates untruth

authentically . Da-sein is always already in irresoluteness, and perhaps will

be soon again. The term irresoluteness merely expresses the phe­

nomenon that was interpreted as being at the mercy of the dominant

interpretedness of the they. As the they-self, Da-sein is "lived" by the
commonsense ambiguity of publicness in which no one resolves, but

which has always already made its decision. Resoluteness means letting
oneself be summoned out of one's lostness in the they. The irresolute-

ness of the they nevertheless remains in dominance, but it cannot attack

resolute existence. As the counter-concept to existentially understood

resoluteness, irresoluteness does not mean an ontic, psychical quality in
the sense of being burdened with inhibitions . Even resolutions are

dependent upon the they and its world. Understanding this is one of the

things that resolution discloses, in that resoluteness first gives to Dasein its authentic transparency. In resoluteness , Da-sein is concerned

with its ownmost potentiality-of-being that, as thrown, can proj ect itself
only upon definite, factical possibilities . Resolution does not escape

from "reality," but first discovers what is factically possible in such a

way that it grasps it as it is possible as one's ownmost potentiality-of-

being in the they. The existential definiteness of possible resolute Dasein includes the constitutive moments of the existential phenomenon

that we call situation and which we have not yet discussed.

In the term situation ( position-" to be in the position of"), there is

an overtone of a spatial significance. We shall not attempt to eliminate it
from the existential concept. For such an overtone is also implied in
the " there" of Da-sein. Being-in-the-world has a spatiality of its own that

299

276

300

Being and Time

II.n

is characterized by the phenomena of de-distancing and directionality.
Da-sein "makes room" in factically existing.16 But the spatiality of Da-sein,
on the basis of which existence actually de termines its "place," is
grounded in the constitution of being-in-the-world, for which disclosed­
ness is primarily cons titu tive . Jus t as the spatiality of the there is
grounded in disclosedness, situation has its basis in resoluteness. Situa­
tion is the there disclosed in resoluteness-as which the existing being is
there. It is not an objectively present framework in which Da-sein occurs
or into which it could even bring itself. Far removed from any objectively
present mixture of the circumstances and accidents encountered, situa­
tion is only through and in resoluteness . The actual factical relevant
character of the circumstances is disclosed to the self only when that rel­
evant character is such that one is resolute for the there which that self,
in existing, has to be. What we call accidents in the with-world and the
surrounding world can only befall resoluteness.
For the they, however, situation is essentially closed off. The they knows
only the "general situation," loses itself in the nearest "opportunities," and
settles its Da-sein by calculating the "accidents" which it fails to recog­
nize, deems its own achievement and passes off as such.
Resoluteness brings the being of the there to the existence of its sit­
uation. But resoluteness delineates the exis tential structure of the
authentic potentiality-of-being attested in conscience-wanting to have a
conscience. In this potentiality we recognized the appropriate under­
standing of the summons . This makes it quite clear that the call of con­
science does not dangle an empty ideal of existence before us when it
summons us to our potentiality-of-being, but calls forth to the situation.
This existential positivity of the correctly understood call of conscience
at the same time makes us see how in limiting the tendency to the call to
actual and planned incidents of indebtednesses we fail to recognize the
disclosive character of conscience. It also makes us see how the con­
crete understanding of the voice of conscience is only seemingly trans­
mitted to us if this restriction is made. The existential interpretation of
understanding the summons as resoluteness reveals conscience as the
kind of being contained in the ground of Da-sein, in which it makes its
factical existence possible for itself, attesting its ownmost potentiality-of­
being.
The phenomenon set forth with the term resoluteness can hardly be
confused with an empty "habitus" and an indefinite "velleity." Resolute­
ness does not first represent and acknowledge a situation to itself, but
has already placed itself in it. Resolute, Da-sein is already acting. We are
purposely avoiding the term "action." For in the firs t place, it would
have to be so broadly conceived that activity also encompasses the pas­
sivity of resistance. In the second place, that term suggests a misinter-

Being and Time

11.11

277

of Da-sein as if resoluteness were a special
p retati on of the ontology
mo de of b ehavior of the practical faculty as opposed to the theoretical
on e. But, as concern taking care of things, care includes the being of Da-

sein so primo rdially and completely that it must be already presupposed
as a whole when we distinguish between theoretical and practical behavio r; it cannot first be put together from these faculties with the help of a

dia l e c tic that is n e c e s s arily groundles s because it is exis tentially

unfo unded.

But resoluteness is only the authenticity of care itself, caredfor in
care and possible as care.

To portray the factical existentiell possibilities in their general fea­

tures and connections, and to interpret them according to their exis­
tential structure, belongs to the scope of tasks of thematical existential

anthro pology.17 For the purpose of our inquiry as a study of fundamen­
tal ontology, it will be sufficient to outline existentially the authentic

potentiality-of-being attested in conscience for Da-sein itself in terms of
Da-sein itself.

Now that resoluteness has been worked out as a self-projection

upon one' s ownmost being-guilty in which one is reticent and ready for

Ang.st, we are prepared to define the ontological meaning of the authen­
tic potentiality-of-being-a-whole of Da-sein which we have been looking
for. The authenticity of Da-sein is neither an empty term nor a fabricated

idea. But even so, as an authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole, the

authentic being-toward-death which we have deduced exis tentially

remains a purely existential proj ect for which the attestation of Da-sein

is lacking. Only when we have found this attestation, will our inquiry suf­

fice to set forth

(as

its problematic requires) an authentic potentiality-of­

being-a-whole of Da-sein, existentially confirmed and clarified. For only

when this being has become phenomenally accessible in its authenticity

and its wholeness will the question of the meaning of the being of this
being, to whose existence belongs an understanding of being as such, be

based upon something that will stand a test.

The Authentic Potentialityfor­
Being-a- Whole of Da-sein,
and Temporality as the
Ontological Meaning of Care

61. Preliminary Sketch of the Methodical Step

from Outlining the Authentic Being-a-Whole of Da-sein
to the Phenomenal Exposition of Temporality
We projected existentially an authentic potentiality-for-being-a-whole of
Da-sein. Analyzing this phenomenon revealed authentic being-towarddeath as

anticipation.1

In its existentiell attestation, the authentic paten-

tiality-of-being of Da-sein was shown to be

resoluteness,

and at the same

time was interpreted existentially. How are we to bring these phenomena of anticipation and resoluteness together? Did our ontological project of the authentic potentiality-for-being-a-whole not lead us to a dimension of Da-sein that is far removed from the phenomenon of regular
type resoluteness? What is death supposed to have in common with the
" concrete situation" of acting? Does not the attempt to bring resoluteness and anticipation forcibly together lead us astray into an intolerable,
completely unphenomenological construction which may no longer
even claim to have the character of an ontological project that is phe­
nomenally grounded?
Externally binding both phenomena together is intrinsically out of
the question. There is still one way out, and this is the only possible

method: to start from the phenomenon of resoluteness, attested in its
existentiell possibility, and to ask: Does resoluteness, in its ownmost existen­
tiell tendency of being itself, point ahead to antic ipatory resoluteness as its own­
most authentic possibility? What if resoluteness, following its own meaning,
were brought into its authenticity only when it no longer projects itself
upon arbitrary possibilities merely lying near by, but rather upon the
most extreme possibility that lies ahead of every factical potentiality of
being of Da-sein, and, as such, more or less enters without distortion
every potentiality-of-being of Da-sein factically seized upon? What if res­

authentic truth of Da-sein, reached the certainty authen­
tically belonging to it only in the anticipation of death? What if all the fac­
tical "anticipatoriness" of resolve were authentically understood, that is,
existentielly caught up with only in the anticipation of death?

oluteness, as the

As long as our existential interpretation does not forget that the
being given it as its theme has the kind of being of Da-sein, and cannot
be joined together out of objectively present pieces into something
objectively present, its steps must be guided by the idea of

existence.

For

the question of the possible connection between anticipation and reso­
luteness, this means nothing less than the demand that we should pro-

303

ject these existential phenomena upon the existentiell possibilities pre­
figured in them and "think these possibilities through" in an existential
way. Thus the development of anticipatory resoluteness as an existen­
tielly possible authentic potentiality-for-being-a-whole loses the character
of an arbitrary construction. It becomes the interpretation that frees
Da-sein for its most extreme possibility of existence.
With this step, the existential interpretation at the same time
makes known its ownmost methodical character. Apart from occasional,
necessary remarks, we have until now deferred explicit discussions of
method. We wanted first of all to "proceed" to the phenomena.

Before

exposing the meaning of being of the being revealed in its fundamental
phenomenal content, the course of our inquiry needs to pause, not in
order to "rest," but in order to gain new momentum.
Any genuine method is grounded in the appropriate preview of
the fundamental constitution of the "object" or area of objects to be
disclosed. Any genuine reflection on method, which is to be distin­
guished from empty discussions of technology, thus at the same time
tells us something about the kind of being of the being in question.* The
clarification of methodical possibilities, requirements, and limits of the
existential analytic in general can alone secure the transparency that is
necessary if we are to take the basic step of revealing the meaning of

being of care.

281

But the interpretation of the ontological meaning of care must be

done on the basis of a complete and constant phenomenological reconsidera­
tion

of the existential constitution of Da-sein set forth up to now.

Ontologically, Da-sein is in principle different from everything
objectively present and real. Its "content" is not founded in the sub­
stan tiality of a substance, but in the "self-constancy" [Selbstiindigkeit] of
the existing self whose being was conceived as care. The phenomenon of
the

self included

in care needs a primordial and authentic existential

definition, in contrast to our preparatory demonstration of the inau­
thentic they-self. Along with this, we must establish what possible onto­
logical questions are to be directed toward the "self," if it is neither sub­
stance nor subj ect.
The phenomenon of care thus sufficiently clarified, can then be
interrogated as to its ontological meaning. Defining this meaning will
lead to the exposition of temporality. In exhibiting this, we are not led
into remote, separate areas of Da-sein; we merely get a conception of the
total phenomenal content of the existential fundamental constitution of
Da-sein in the ultimate foundations of its own ontological intelligibility.

Temporality is experienced as a primordial phenomenon in the authentic being­
a-whole of Da-sein, in the phenomenon of anticipatory resoluteness. If temporality makes itself known primordially here, the temporality of anticipatory resoluteness is presumably a distinctive mode of that temporality.
Temporality can

temporalize

itself in various possibilities and various

ways. The fundamental possibilities of existence, the authenticity and
inauthenticity of Da-sein, are ontologically grounded in possible tem­
poralizations of temporality.
If the ontological character of its own being is remote from Da-sein
because of the dominance of its entangled understanding of being
(being as objective presence), the primordial foundations of this being
are still more remote. Thus one must not be surprised if at first glance
temporality does not correspond to what is accessible to the vulgar
understanding as "time." Thus neither the concept of time of the vulgar
experience of time nor the problematic arising from it can function
uncritically as a criterion for the appropriateness of an interpretation of
time. Rather, our inquiry must become familiar with the primordial
phenomenon of temporality

beforehand,

so that

in terms of this

we may

cast light on the necessity, the source, and the reason for the domi­
nance of the vulgar understanding of time.
The primordial phenomenon of temporality will be made secure by
demonstrating that all the fundamental structures of Da-sein exposed
up to now are to be basically conceived "temporally" with regard to their
possible totality, unity, and development, and as modes of the temporal­
izing of temporality. Thus, when temporality has been exposed, the task

304

282

II.m

Being and Time

arises for the existential analytic of retrieving the analysis ofDa-sein in the
sense of interpreting the essential structures with a view to their tempo­
rality. Temporality itself sketches out the fundamental directions of the
analyses thus required. Thus the chapter has the following divisions:
Anticipatory resoluteness as the existentielly authentic potentiality-for­
being-a-whole of Da-sein (section

62);

the hermeneutical situation at

which we have arrived for interpreting the meaning of being of care and
the methodical character of the existential analytic in general (section

305

63);

care and selfhood (section 64); temporality as the ontological meaning of

care (section

65); the temporality ofDa-sein and the tasks arising from it

of a primordial retrieve of the existential analytic (section

66).

62. The Existentielly Authentic Potentialityfor-Being-a-Whole

ofDa-sein as Anticipatory Resoluteness
How does resoluteness, "thought out" in accordance with its ownmost
tendency of being, lead us to authentic being-toward-death? How is the
connection between wanting to have a conscience and the existentially
projected, authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole of Da-sein to be con­
ceived? Does welding the two together result in a new phenomenon? Or
are we left with the resoluteness attested in its existentiell possibility in
such a way that it can undergo an

existentiell modalization through being­

toward-death? But what does it mean "to think out" the phenomenon of
resoluteness existentially?
Resoluteness was characterized as the reticent self-projecting upon
one's ownmost being-guilty, and as demanding
guilty belongs to Da-sein and means: null

Ang:st of oneself. Being­
being the ground of a nullity.

The "guilty" that belongs to the being of Da-sein admits neither of
increase nor decrease. It lies

before

all quantification, if the latter has

any meaning at all. Being essentially guilty, Da-sein is not just guilty

occasionally

and

other times not.

Wanting-to-have-a-conscience resolves

itself for this being-guilty. The intrinsic sense of resoluteness is to project
upon itself this being-guilty thatDa-sein is as

long as it is. Taking over this

"guilt" existentielly in resoluteness occurs authentically only if resolute­
ness in its disclosing of Da-sein has become so transparent that it under­

stands being-guilty

as something constant.

But this understanding is made

possible only in such a way thatDa-sein discloses to itself its potentiality­
of-being "up to its end." The

being-at-an-end ofDa-sein,

however, means

existentially being-toward-the-end . Resoluteness becomes authentically
what it can be as

being-toward-the-end-that-understands,

that is, as anticipa­

tion of death. Resoluteness does not simply "have" a connection with
anticipation as something other than itself. It harbours in itself authentic
being-toward-death as the possible existentiell modality of its own authenticity.

We want now to clarify this "connection" phenomenally.
Resolutene ss means: letting oneself be called forth to one's own­
most being guilty. Being gu ilty belongs to the being of Da-sein itself,
which we defined primarily as potentiality-of-being. The statement that
Da-s ein "is" constantly guilty can only mean that it always maintains
-

-

306

itself in this being either as authentic or inauthentic existence. Beingguilty is not just a lasting quality of something constantly objectively
present, but the

existentiell poss ibility of being authentically or inauthenis always only in the actual factical potentiality-of-

tically guilty. "Guilty"

being. Thus, being-guilty must be conceived as a potentiality-for-beingguilty, because it belongs to the

being of Da-sein.

Resoluteness projects

itself upon this potentiality-of-being, that is, understands itself in it.
Thus, this understanding stays in a primordial possibility of Da-sein. It
stays

in it authentically when resoluteness is primordially what it tends to

be. But we revealed the primordial being of Da-sein toward its poten­
tiality-of-being as being-toward-death, that is, toward the eminent possibility of Da-sein which we characterized. Anticipation disclosed this pos­
sibility as possibility. Thus, resoluteness becomes a primordial being
toward the ownmost potentiality-of-being of Da-sein only

as

anticipatory.

Resoluteness understands the "can" of its potentiality-for-being-guilty
only when it "qualifies" itself as being-toward-death.
Resolutely, Da-sein takes over authentically in its existence the fact
that it

is

the null ground of its nullity. We conceived of death existen­

tially as what we characterized as the possibility of the impossibility of
existence, that is, as the absolute nothingness of Da-sein. Death is not
pieced on to Da-sein as its "end," but, as care, Da-sein is the thrown
(that is, null) ground of its death. The nothingness primordially domi­
nant in the being of Da-sein is revealed to it in authentic being-toward­
death. Anticipation makes being-guilty evident only on the basis of the

whole being of Da-sein.

Care contains death and guilt equiprimordially.

Only anticipatory resoluteness understands the potentiality-for-being­
guilty

authentically and wholly,

that is, primordially.2

Understanding the call of conscience reveals the lostness in the
they. Resoluteness brings Da-sein back to its ownmost potentiality-of­
being-a-self. One's own potentiality-of-being becomes authentic and
transparent in the understanding being-toward-death as the

ownmost

possibility.
The call of conscience passes over all "worldly" status and abilities
of Da-sein in its summons. Disregarding those, it individualizes Da-sein
down to its potentiality-for-being-guilty which it expects it to be authen­
tically. The unwavering trenchancy with which Da-sein is thus essen­
tially individualized down to its ownmost potentiality-of-being discloses
anticipation of death as the

nonrelational possibility.

Anticipatory reso-

luteness lets the potentiality-for-being-guilty, as its ownmost nonrela­
tional possibility, completely strike into its conscience.
Wanting-to-have-a-conscience signifies the readiness for the sum­
mons to one's ownmost being-guilty that always already determined fac­
tical Da-sein

before any factical indebtedness

and

after that indebtedness

has been s ettled. This prior and constant being guilty, which is con­
stantly with us, does not show itself without being covered over in its
character as prior until that priority is placed in the possibility which is
for Da-sein absolutely

not to be bypassed.

When resoluteness, anticipating,

has caught up with the possibility of death in its potentiality-of-being, the
authentic existence of Da-sein can no longer be

left behind by anything.

With the phenomenon of resoluteness we were led to the primor­
dial

truth

of existence. Resolute, Da-sein is revealed to itself in its actual

factical potentiality-of-being in such a way that it itself is this revealing and
b eing revealed. To any truth, there belongs a corresponding holding­
for-true. The explicit appropriation of what is disclosed or discovered is

being-certain. The

primordial truth of existence requires an equiprimor­

dial being-certain in which one holds oneself in what resoluteness dis­
closes . It gives itself the actual factical situation and brings itself into that
situation. The situation cannot be calculated in advance and pregiven
like something objectively present waiting to be grasped. It is disclosed
only in a free act of resolve that has not been determined beforehand,
but is open to the possibility of such determination. Wha� then, does the
certainty belonging to such resoluteness mean? This certainty must hold itself
in what is disclosed in resolution. But this means that it simply cannot
become rigid about the situation, but must understand that the resolution
must be kept free and open for the actual factical possibility in accordance

308

with its own meaning as a disclosure . The certainty of the resolution
means

keeping oneselffree for the possibility of taking it back,

a possibility

that is always factically necessary. This holding-for-true in resoluteness (as
the truth of existence), however, by no means lets us fall back into irres­
oluteness. On the contrary, this holding-for-true, as a resolute holding
oneself free for taking back, is the

authentic resoluteness to retrieve itself. But

thus one's very lostness in irresoluteness is existentielly undermined.

The holding-for-true that belongs to resoluteness tends, in accordance
with its meaning, toward
itself free for the

constantly keeping itself free, that is, to keep
whole potentiality-of-being of Da-sein. This constant cer­

tainty is guaranteed to resoluteness only in such a way that it relates to
that possibility of which it can

be absolutely certain.

In its death, Da-sein

must absolutely "take itself back." Constantly certain of this, that is,

ipating,

antic­

resoluteness gains its authentic and whole certainty.

But Da-sein is equiprimordially in untruth. Anticipatory resolute­
ness at the same time gives Da-sein the primordial certainty of its being

constant lostness in the irresoluteness of the they-a lostness which is

indefiniteness of its potentiality-of-being is

always determined only in a resolution with regard to the actual situa­

to correspond to authentic resoluteness. Although it always becomes

ipation brings Da-sein face to face with a possibility that is constantly cer­
tain and yet remains indefinite at every moment as to when this possi­
bility becomes impossibility. Anticipation makes evident the fact that
this being has been thrown into the indefiniteness of its "borderline sit­
uation," when, resolved upon the latter, Da-sein gains its authentic
potentiality-of-being-a-whole. The indefiniteness of death discloses itself
primordially in

Angst.

But this primordial

Angst

strives to expect reso­

luteness of itself. It clears away every covering over of the fact that Da­
sein is left to itself. The nothingness before which Angst brings us reveals
the nullity that determines Da-sein in its ground, which itself is as thrown­
ness into death.
Our analysis revealed in order the

moments of modalization

toward

which resoluteness tends of itself and which stern from authentic being­
toward-death as the ownrnost nonrelational possibility not-to-be­
bypassed, certain and yet indefinite. It is authentically and completely
what it can be only as

anticipatory resoluteness .

But, conversely, our interpretation of the "connection" between
resoluteness and anticipation first attained the complete existential
understanding of anticipation itself. Until now, it was valid only as an
ontological project. Now we see that anticipation is not a fictitious pos­
sibility that we have forced upon Da-sein, but rather a

mode of a poten­

tiality-of-being existentielly attested in Da-sein which it expects of itself,
if indeed it understands itself authentically as resolute. Anticipation "is"
not some kind of unattached behavior, but must rather be conceived of

the possibility of the authenticity of that resoluteness existentielly attested to in
such resoluteness-a possibility concealed and thus also attested. Authentic
as

"thinking about death" is wanting to have a conscience, which has
become existentielly transparent to itself.
If authentic resoluteness tends toward the mode defined by antic­
ipation, and if anticipation constitutes the authentic potentiality-of-being­
a-whole of Da-sein; then an authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole of
Da-sein is also attested in resoluteness existentielly attested.

The ques-

309

286

11.111

Being and Time

tion of the potentiality-of being- a-whole is a Jac tical, existentiell one. It is
answered by Da-sein as resolute. The question of the potentiality-of-being-a­
whole of Da-sein has now completely cast off the character which we ini­
tially3 pointed out when we treated it as if were just a theoretical,
methodical question of the analytic of Da-sein, arising from the attempt
to have the whole of Da-sein completely "given." The question of the
totality of Da-sein, initially discussed only with regard to ontological
method, has its justification, but only because the ground for that justi­
fication goes back to an ontic possibility of Da-sein.
Our clarification of the "connection" between anticipation and
resoluteness in the sense of a possible modalization of resoluteness by
anticipation, turned into the phenomenal demonstration of an authen­
tic potentiality-of-being-a-whole of Da-sein. If with this phenomenon a
mode of being of Da-sein has been grasped in which it brings itself to
and before itself, it must remain ontically and ontologically unintelligible
to the everyday, commonsense interpretation of Da-sein by the they. It

310

would be a misunderstanding to put this existentiell possibility aside as
being "unproven" or to want to "prove" it theoretically. Nevertheless, the
phenomenon must be shielded from the crudest distortions.
Anticipatory resoluteness is not a way out fabricated for the pur­
pose of "overcoming" death, but it is rather the understanding that
follows the call of conscience and that frees for death the possibility of

gaining power over

the

existence

of Da-sein and of basically dispersing

every fugitive self<overing-over. Nor does wanting to have a conscience,
which we defined as being-toward-death, mean a detachment in which
one flees from the world, but brings one without illusions to the reso­
luteness of "acting." Nor does anticipatory resoluteness stem from "ide­
alistic" expectations soaring above existence and its possibilities; but
arises from the sober understanding of the basic factical possibilities of
Da-sein. Together with the sober

Angs t

that brings us before our indi­

vidualized potentiality-of-being, goes the unshakable joy in this possi­
bility. In it Da-sein becomes free of the entertaining "incidentals" that
busy curiosity provides for itself, primarily in terms of the events of
the world. However, the analysis of these fundamental moods goes
beyond the limits drawn for our present inquiry by aiming toward fun­
damental ontology.
But does not a definite ontic interpretation of authentic existence,
a factical ideal of Da-sein, underlie our ontological interpretation of the
existence of Da-sein? Indeed. But not only is this fact one that must not
be denied and we are forced to grant; it must be understood in its posi­

tive necessi ty,

in terms of the thematic object of our inquiry. Philosophy

will never seek to deny its "presuppositions," but neither may it merely
admit them. It conceives them and develops with more and more pen-

63. The Hermeneutical S it uation at Which We Have Arrived

for Interpret ing the Meaning of Being of Care, and the
Methodical Character of the Existential Analytic in General

1n its anticipatory resoluteness, Da-sein has been made phenomenally vis­

ible with regard to its possible authenticity and totality. The hermeneutical situation• which was previously insufficient for the interpretation of
the meaning of being of care, now has the required primordiality. Dasein has been placed in our fore-having primordially, that is, with regard
to its authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole; the guiding fore-sight, the
idea of existence, has attained its definiteness through the clarification of
the ownmost potentiality-of-being; with the concretely developed structure of being of Da-sein, its ontological peculiarity, as opposed to everything objectively present, has become so clear that our fore-grasp on
the existentiality of Da-sein possesses sufficient articulation to guide
securely the conceptual development of the existentials .
The path of the analytic of Da-sein which we have traversed so far
has led us to a concrete demonstration of the thesis5 only suggested at
the beginning:

thest fr om

The being that we ourselves always are is ontologically far­

us. The reason for this lies in care i tself. Entangled being­

together-with-the-"world" initially taken care of, guided the everyday
interpretation of Da-sein, and covered over ontically the authentic being
of Da-sein, thus denying the appropriate basis for an ontology oriented
toward this being.* Thus the primordial phenomenal fore-giving of this
being is not at all self-evident, even if the ontology initially follows the
course of the everyday interpretation of Da-sein. Rather, freeing the
primordial being of Da-sein must be

wrested from Da-sein in opposition to

the entangled, ontic, and ontological tendency of interpretation.
Not only the demonstration of the most elemental structures of
being-in-the-world, the definition of the concept of world, the clarifica­
tion of the nearest and most average who of this being, of the they-self,
the interpretation of the "there," but above all the analyses of care,
death, conscience, and guilt show

how

the commonsense way of taking

care of things has taken over the potentiality-of-being of Da-sein and
the disclosure of that potentiality, or rather its closing off.

* Wrong! As if ontology could be taken from what is genuinely on tic. For what
is the genuinely ontic if it is not genuinely taken from a pre-ontological project­
if all of this is to remain in this distinction.

311

288

Il.m

Being and Time
Thus the

kind

of being of Da-sein

requires

of an ontological inter­

pretation that has set as its goal the primordiality of the phenomenal
demonstration that it be in charge of the being of this being in spite of this
being's own tendency to cuver things uver. Thus the existential analytic con­
stantly has the character of doing violence, whether for the claims of the
everyday interpretation or for its complacency and its tranquillized obvi­
ousness. Of course, this character is especially distinctive of the ontology
of Da-sein, but it belongs to any interpretation because the understand-

312

ing that unfolds in interpretation has the structure of a project. But is
not anything of this sort guided and

regula ted in a way of its own? Where

are ontological projects to get the evidence that their "findings" are
phenomenally appropriate? Ontological interpretation projects the
beings given to it upon the being appropriate to them, so as to bring
them to a concept with regard to their structure. Where are the guide­
posts to direct the projection so that being will be reached at all ? And
what if the being that is thematic for the existential analytic conceals the
being which belongs to it and does so

in its very way of being? To answer

these questions we must initially restrict ourselves to clarifying the ana­
lytic of Da-sein, as the questions themselves demand.
Self-interpretation belongs to the being of Da-sein. In the circum­
spect discovery of the "world" taking care of things, taking care of things
is sighted, too. Da-sein always already understands itself factically in def..
inite existentiell possibilities, even if its projects arise only from the
common sense of the they. Whether explicitly or not, whether appro­
priately or not, existence is somehow understood too. Every antic under­
standing "includes" certain things, even if only pre-ontologically, that is,
even if they are not grasped theoretically and thematically. Every onto­
logically explicit question about the being of Da-sein has already had the
way prepared for it by the kind of being of Da-sein.
Nevertheless, how are we to find out what constitutes the "authen­
tic" existence of Da-sein? Without an existentiell understanding, all anal­
ysis of existentiality remains without foundation. Does not an antic con­
ception of existence underlie our interpretation of the authenticity and
totality of Da-sein, an antic interpretation that might be possible, but
need not be binding for every one. Existential interpretation will never
seek to take over a fiat as to those things that, from an existentiell point
of view, are possible or binding. But must it not justify itself with regard
to

those existentiell possibilities that it uses to give the antic base for the

ontological interpretation? If the being of Da-sein is essentially poten­
tiality-of-being and being free for its ownmost possibilities, and if it
always exists only in freedom or unfreedom for them, can the ontologi­
cal interpretation take as its basis anything other than

(modes of potentiality-of-being) and project

possibility? And if Da-sein mostly interprets itself in terms of its lostness in

taking care of the "world," isn't the determination of the ontic and exis­

opposition to that lostness) the mode of its disclosure appropriate to this

The "violent" presentation of possibilities of existence may be

required for our method, but can it escape being merely arbitrary? If our
analytic takes anticipatory resoluteness as its basis, as an existentielly
authentic potentiality-of-being, and if Da-sein itself summons to this pos­
sibility right out of the ground of its existence, is this possibility then an

up by chance?

The antic and ontological project of Da-sein upon an authentic
potentiality-of-being-a-whole may not be arbitrary, but is the existential
interpretation of these phenomena then already justified? Where does

this interpretation get its guidelines, if not from a "presupposed" idea of
existence in general? How are the steps of the analysis of inauthentic
everydayness regulated, if not by the concept of existence that we have
posited? And if we say that Da-sein "falls prey," and that thus the authen­
ticity of its potentiality-of-being is to be wrested from this tendency of
being-from what perspective are we speaking here? Isn't everything
illuminated by the light of the "presupposed" idea of existence, even if
rather dimly? Where does this idea get its justification? Has our initial
project, in which we called attention to it, led us nowhere? By no means.
Our formal indication of the idea of existence was guided by the
understanding of being in Da-sein itself. Without any ontological trans­
parency, it was, after all, revealed that I myself

am

always the being

which we call Da-sein, as the potentiality-of-being that is concerned to be
this being. Da-sein understands itself as being-in-the-world, although
without sufficient ontological definiteness. Thus existing, it encounters
beings of the kind of being of things at hand and objectively present. No
matter how far removed from an ontological concept the distinction
between existence and reality may be, even if Da-sein initially under­
stands existence as reality, Da-sein is not just objectively present, but
has always already

understood itself, however mythical or magical its inter­

pretations may be. For otherwise, Da-sein would not "live" in a myth and
would not take heed of its magic in rites and cults. The idea of exis-

Being and Time

tence which we have posited gives us an outline of the formal structure
of the understanding of Da-sein in general, and does so in a way that is
not binding from an existentiell point of view.
Under the guidance o f this idea the preparatory analysis of the

314

everydayness nearest to us has been carried out as far as a first concep­
tual definition of care. This phenomenon enabled us to get a more pre­
cise grasp of existence and its relations to facticity and falling prey. The
definition of the structure of care has given us a basis on which to dis­
tinguish ontologically between existence and reality for the first time.6
This led to the thesis that the substance of human being is existence.7
But even this formal idea of existence, which is not binding in an
existentiell way, already contains a definite though unprofiled ontologi­
cal "content" that "presupposes" an idea of being in general-just like the
idea of reality contrasted with it. Only in the horizon of

that

idea of

being can the distinction between existence and reality be made. After
all, both mean

being.

But is not the ontologically clarified idea of being in general first to
be attained by developing the understanding of being that belongs to
Da-sein? However, that understanding can be grasped primordially only
on the basis of a primordial interpretation of Da-sein guided by the
idea of existence. Does it not thus finally become evident that this prob­
lem of fundamental ontology that we have set forth is moving in a "cir­
cle"?
We already showed, in the structure of understanding in general,
that what is faulted with the inappropriate expression "circle" belongs to
the essence and the distinctiveness of understanding itself. 8 Still, our
inquiry must now return explicitly to this "circular" argument if the
problematic of fundamental ontology is to have its hermeneutical situ­
ation clarified. When it is objected that the existential interpretation is
"circular," it is said that the idea of existence and of being in general is
"presupposed," and that Da-sein gets interpreted "accordingly" so that
the idea of being may be obtained from it. But what does "presuppos­
ing" mean? In positing the idea of existence, do we also posit some
proposition from which we can deduce further propositions about the
being ofDa-sein, according to the formal rules of consistency? Or does
this pre-supposing have the character of an understanding project in

such a way that the interpretation developing this understanding

3 15

what is to be interpreted be put

with regard to their being at all? In the existential analytic, a "circle" in
the proof cannot be "avoided," because that analytic is

not proving any-

thing according to the rules of logic of consistency at all. What common
sense wishes to get rid of by avoiding the "circle," thinking that it does
justice to the loftiest rigor of scientific investigation, is nothing less than
the basic structure of care. Primordially constituted by care, Da-sein is
always already ahead of itself. Existing, it has always already projected
itself upon definite possibilities of its existence; and in these existen­
tiell projects it has also projected pre-ontologically something like exis­

tial to Da-sein, which,

that wants to develop and conceptualize the understanding of

being belonging to Da-sein?
But the "charge of circularity" itself comes from a kind of being of
Da-sein. Something like projecting, especially ontological projecting,
necessarily remains foreign for the common sense of our heedful
absorption in the they because common sense barricades itself against it
"in principle." Whether "theoretically" or "practically," common sense
only takes care of beings that are in view of its circumspection. What is
distinctive about common sense is that it thinks it experiences only "fac­
tual" beings in order to be able to rid itself of its understanding of
being. It fails to recognize that beings can be "factually" experienced
only when being has already been understood, although not conceptu­
alized. Common sense misunderstands understanding. And for

son

this rea­

it must also necessarily proclaim as "violent" anything lying beyond

the scope of its understanding as well as any move in that direction.
The talk about the "circle" in understanding expresses the failure to
recognize two things:

( 1 ) That understanding itself constitutes a basic

kind of the being of Da-sein.

(2) That this being is constituted as care. To

deny the circle, to make a secret of it or even to wish to overcome it
means to anchor this misunderstanding once and for all. Rather, our
attempt must aim at leaping into this "circle" primordially and com­
pletely, so that even at the beginning of our analysis of Da-sein we make
sure that we have a complete view of the circular being of Da-sein. Not
too much, but

too little

is "presupposed" for the ontology of Da-sein, if

one "starts out with" a worldless I in order then to provide that I with an
object and an ontologically baseless relation to that object. Our view is too
short-sighted if we make "life" a problem, and then occasionally also take
death into account. The thematic objection is

art ific ially and dogmatically

cut out if one limits oneself "initially" to a "theoretical subject," and then
complements it "on the practical side" with an additional "ethic."
This will suffice to clarify the existential meaning of the hermeneu­
tical situation of a primordial analytic of Da-sein. With the exposition of
anticipatory resoluteness Da-sein has been brought before us with regard
to its authentic totality. The authenticity of the potentiality-of-being-a-self

guarantees the fore-sight of primordial existentiality, and this assures us
of coining the appropriate existential concepts.
At the same time, the analysis of anticipatory resoluteness led us to
the phenomenon of primordial and authentic truth. Earlier we showed
how the understanding of being that prevails initially and for the most
part conceives being in the sense of objective presence and thus covers
over9 the primordial phenomenon of truth. But if "there is"

[es gibt]

being only when truth "is," and if the understanding of being always
varies according to the kind of truth, then primordial and authentic
truth must guarantee the understanding of the being of Da-sein and of
being in general. The ontological "truth" of the existential analysis is
developed on the basis of primordial, existentiell truth. Yet the latter
does not necessarily need the former. The most primordial and basic
existential truth, for which the problematic of fundamental ontology
strives in preparing the question of being in general is the disclosure

meaning of being of care.

In order to reveal this meaning, we need to hold

in readiness, undiminished, the full structural content of care.

and falling prey made possible a first ontological definition of the total­
ity of the structural whole of Da-sein. The structure of care was given an
existential formula: being-ahead-of-oneself-already-being-in (a world) as
being-together-with (innerworldly beings encountered). The totality of
the structure of care does not first arise from a coupling together, yet it
articulated. 10 In assessing this ontological result, we have had to esti­

is

mate how well it satisfies11 the requirements of a pri mordial interpretation
of Da-sein. We found that neither the

whole

of Da-sein nor its

authentic

potentiality-of-being had been made thematic. However, the attempt to
grasp phenomenally the whole of Da-sein seemed to get stranded pre­
cisely on the structure of care. The ahead-of-itself presented itself as a
not-yet. But the ahead-of-itself, characterized in the sense of something
outstanding, revealed itself to our genuine existential reflection as

toward the end,

being

someth�ng that in the depths of its being every Da-sein is.

We also made it clear that care summons Da-sein to its ownmost poten­
tiality-of-being in the call of conscience. Understanding the summons
revealed itself-primordially understood-as anticipatory resoluteness,
which includes an authentic potentiality-of-being-whole of Da-sein. The
structure of care does not speak

against the possibility of being-a-whole,

How are we to grasp this unity? How can Da-sein exist as a unity in
the ways and possibilities of its being that we mentioned? Evidently only
in su ch a way that it itself is this being in its essential possibilities, that I
am always* this being. The " I " seems to "hol d together" the totality of
the structural whole. The "I'' and the "self" have been conceived for a

long time in the "ontology" of this being as the supporting ground (sub­
stance or subject). Even in its preparatory characterization of everyday­
ness, our analytic also already encountered the question of the who of
Da-sein. We found that Da-sein is initially and for the most part

not

itself, but lost in the they-self. t The they-self is an existentiell modification

of the authenti c self. The question of the ontological constitution of

selfhood remained unanswered. It is true that we already established
the guidelines for the problem:12 If the self belongs to the essential qualities of Da-sein whose "essence," however, lies in

Negatively, we also saw

that our ontological characterization of the they ruled out any application of the categories of objective presence (substance). In principle it
became clear that care canno t be derived ontologically from reality or be
constructed with th e categories of reality. 1� C are already contains the

phenomenon of self, if indeed the thesis is correct that the expression
"care for self' would be

tautological14

if it were proposed in conformity

with concern as care for others. But then the problem of the ontological
definition of the selfhood of D a-sein gets sharpened to the question of
the existential " connection" b e tween care and selfhood.
To clarify the existentiality of the self, we take as our "natural"

point of departure the everyday self-interpretation of Da-sein that
expresses " itself" in s aying-!. Utterance is not necessary. With the "I," this

simple thing, the "I" is not a definition of other things: it is

teristics of "simplicity," "substantiality, " and "personality," which Kant,
for example, takes as the foundation for his doctrine "On the paralo­
gisms of pure reason"15 arise from a genuine "pre-phenomenological"
experience. The question remains whether what was experienced in
such a way ontically may be interpreted ontologically with the aid of
the "categories" mentioned.
In strict conformity with the phenomenal content given in saying1, Kant did show that the ontic theses about the substance of the soul

obtained some assurance of it and made positive preparations for it.
Although Kant attempts, more strictly than his predecessors, to hold

319

on to the phenomenal content of saying I, he does, after all, slip back
into the

same

inappropriate ontology of the substantial, whose_ ontic

foundations he theoretically rejected for the I. We must show this more
precisely, in order to establish what it means ontologically to take saying

I as the point of departure for the analysis of selfhood. The Kantian
analysis of the "I think" should now be adduced as an illustration, but
only to the extent that it is required for the clarification of the prob­
6

lematic in question. 1

The "I" is a bare consciousness that accompanies all concepts. In
the I, nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of
thoughts. "Consciousness in itself (is) not a representation . . . , but a
form of representation in general. "17 The "I think" is "the form of apper­
ception that adheres to every experience and precedes it. "18

Kant grasps the phenomenal content of the "I" correctly in the
expression "I think" or-if the relation of the "practical person" to "intel­
ligence" is also considered-in the expression "I act." In Kant's sense
saying-1 must be conceived as saying I think. Kant attempts to establish
the phenomenal content of the I as

res cogitans.

I f he then calls this I a

"logical subject," that does not mean that the I in general is a concept
gained merely by logical means. Rather, the I is the subject of logical
behavior, of binding together. The "I think" means I bind together. All
binding together is an "/bind together." In any taking together and
relating, the I always already

underlies-hupokeimenon.

Thus the subject

is "consciousness in itself," not a representation, t but rather the "form"
of representation. That means that the I think is not something repre*And being intent upon ontic-suprasensuous statements

sented, bu t the formal structure of representing as such, and this formal
structure alone makes it possible for anything to be represented. The
form of repres entation means neither a framework nor a universal con-

cept, but that which, as eidos, makes everything represented and every
rep res enting be what it is. If the I is understood as the form of repre­
sen tatio n, this amounts to saying that it is the "logical subj ect."

Kant's analysis has two positive aspects : on the one hand, he sees
the impos sibility of ontically reducing the I to a "substance." On the
oth er h and, he holds fast to the I as "I think. " Nevertheless, he conceives this I again as subj ect, thus in an ontologi cally inappropriate

320

sense. For the ontological concept of the subject does not characterize the
seljhood of the I qua self, but the sameness and constancy of something always
already objectively present. To define the I ontologically as a subject means

to posit it as something always already objectively present. The being of

the I is understood as the reality* of the

res cogitans.19

But what is the reason that while the "I think" gives Kant a genuine

phenomenal point of departure, he cannot exploit it ontologically, but is

forced to fall back upon the "subject," that is, something substantial? The

I is not only an "I think," but an "I think something." However, does not
Kant himself emphasize again and again that the I remains related to its
representations, and would be nothing without them?

But for Kant these representations are the "empirical," which is

"accompanied" by the 1-the appearances to which the I is "connected. "

B u t nowhere does Kant show the kind o f being o f this "connection"

and "accompanying." At bottom, however, their kind of being is under­
stood as the constant objective presence of the I together with its rep­

resentations. Kant did avoid cutting off the I from thinking, but without

positing the "I think" itself in its full essential content as "I think some­

thing," and above all without seeing the ontological "presupposition" for
the "I think something" as the fundamental determination of the self. t

For even the point of departure of the "I think something" is not defi­

nite enough ontologically, because the "something" remains indefinite.

If by this something we unders tand an

In saying-/, Da-sein expresses itself as being-in-the-world. But does every­

must make a distinction. Surely in saying-I Da-sein means the being that
it its elf always is. But the everyday interpretation of the self has the ten­
dency to understand itself in terms of the "world" taken care of. When
Da-sein has itself in view ontically, it fails

to see

itself in relation to the

kind of being of the being that it itself is. And that is particularly true of
the fundamental constitution of Da-sein, being-in-the-world.21
How is this "fleeting" saying-! motivated? By the entanglement of

322

Da-sein, for as falling prey it flees from itself to the they. The "natural"
talk about the I takes place in the they-self. What expresses itself in the
" I'' is that self that, initially and for the most part, I

not authentically.

When one is abs orbed in the everyday multiplicity and rapid succes­
sion of what is taken care of, the self of the self-forgetful "I take care of'
shows itself as what is constantly and identically simple, but indefinite
and empty. One

not give the ontological inter­
right to go along with this oversight and to force an

inappropriate " categorial" horizon upon the problematic of the self.
Of course, by refusing to go along with the everyday way in which
the I talks, our ontological interpretation of the "I'' has by no means

solved

the problem; but it has indeed

prescribed the direction

for further

questioning. The I is the being that one is in "being-in-the-world . "

Already-being in-a-world as being-together-with-innerworldly-things-at­
hand means, however, equiprimordially being-ahead-of-oneself. "I" means
the being that is concerned

about the being of the being which it is.

phenomenally oriented toward the meaning of being of the authentic­

potentiality-of-being-a-self are we put in a position to discuss what onto­
logical justification there is for treating substantiality, simplicity, and
personality as characteristics of selfhood. The ontological question of the
being of the self must be extricated from the forehaving, constantly sug­
gested by the predominant way of saying-I, of a persistently objectively
present self-thing.

Care does not need a foundation in a self. But existentiality as a con­
stituent of care gives the ontological constitution of the self-constancy of Da­
sein to which there belongs, corresponding to the complete structural content of
care, the facticalfalling prey to unself-constancy. The structure of care, con­
ceived in full , includes the phenomenon of selfhood. This phenomenon

is clarified by interpreting the meaning of care which we defined as the
totality of b eing of Da-sein .

the Ontological Meaning of Care

In characterizing the " connection" between care and selfhood, our aim
was not only to clarify the special problem of 1-hood but also to help in
the fmal preparation for phenomenally grasping the totality of the struc­
tural whole of Da-sein. We need the

unwavering discipline

of the exis­

tential line of questioning if, for our ontological viewpoint, the kind of
being of Da-sein is not finally to be distorted into a mode of objective
presence, even if it is quite undifferentiated. Da-sein becomes "essential"
in authentic existence that is constituted as anticipatory resoluteness .
This mode of the authenticity of care contains the primordial self­
constancy and totality of Da-sein. We must take an undistracted look at
these and understand them existentially if we are to expose the onto­
logical meaning of the being of Da-sein.

in the context of the analysis of understanding and interpretation.22
According to that analysis, meaning is that in which the intelligibility of
something keeps itself, without coming into view explicitly and themat­
ically. Meaning signifies that upon which the primary proj ect is pro­
j ected, that in terms of which something can be conceived in its possi­
bility as what it is. Projecting discloses possibilities, that is, it discloses
what makes something possible.
To expose that upon which a project is projected, means to dis­
close what makes what is projected possible. This exposure requires
that we methodically pursue the proj ect (usually an inexplicit one)
underlying an interpretation in such a way that what is projected in the
project is disclosed and conceivable with regard to its upon-which. To set
forth the meaning of care, then, means to pursue the project underlying
and guiding the primordial existential interpretation of Da-sein in such
a way that its upon-which becomes visible in what is projected. What is
projected is the being of Da-sein, disclosed in what constitutes it as an
authentic potentiality-for-being-a-whole. The upon-which of what is pro­
jected, of the disclosed being thus constituted, is what itself makes pos­
sible this constitution of being as care. With the question of the meaning

tural whole of care in the unity of its unfolded articulation?

of care, we are asking

Strictly speaking, meaning signifies the upon-which of the primary
project of the understanding of being. Being-in-the-world that is disclosed
to itself equiprimordially understands the being of innerworldly beings
together with the being of the being that it itself is, although unthemati­
cally and not yet differentiated in its primary modes of existence and real­
ity. Every ontic experience of beings, the circums pect calculation of things

at hand as well as the positive scientific cognition of things objectively
present, are always grounded in the more or less transparent projects of

the being of the beings in question. But these projects contain an upon­
which from which, so to speak, the understanding of being is nourished.
If we say that beings "have meaning," this signifies that they have
become accessible

in their being,

and this being, projected upon its upon­

which, is what "reall y" "has meaning" first of all . Beings "have" meaning
only because, as being that has been disclosed beforehand, they become
intelligible in the project of that being, that is, in terms of the upon-

325

which of this project. The primary proj ect of the understanding of being
"gives" meaning. The question of the meaning of the being of a being
takes as its theme the upon-which of the understanding of being that
underlies all

being of beings.

Da-sein is disclosed to itself authentically or inauthentically with
regard to its existence. Existing, it understands itself in such a way that this
understanding does not just grasp something, but constitutes the exis-

Being and Time

n.ul

g of its factical potentiality-of-being. The being that is dis­
tenti ell bein
dos ed is that of a being that is concerned about its being. The meaning of
this b eing-that is, care-is what makes care possible in its constitution, and

it is what primordially makes up the being of this potentiality-of-being. The
meaning of being of Da-sein is not something different from it, unattached
and "ou ts ide " of it, but is self-understanding Da-sein itself. What makes

pos sible the being of Da-sein, and thus its factical existence?
What is projected in the primordial existential proj ect of existence
revealed itself as anticipatory resoluteness . * What makes possible this

authentic being-a-whole of Da-sein with regard to the unity of its articu­

lated structural whole? Expressed formally and existentially, without

constantly naming the complete structural content, anticipatory reso­

luteness is the being tuward one's ownmost, eminent potentiality-of-being.
Som ething like this is possible only in such way that Da-sein can come
toward itself at

all in its

ownmost possibility and perdure the possibility

as possibility in this letting-itself-come-toward-itself, that is, that it exists .

Le tting-c om e toward itself that perdures the eminent possibility is the pri­
-

-

mordial phenomenon of the future. If authentic or inauthentic

being­
tuward-death belongs to the being of Da-sein, this is possible only as futu­
ral in the sense indicated now and to be more closely defined later.
Here "future" does not mean a now that has not yet become "actual"
and that sometime will be for the first time, but the coming in which Da­

sein comes toward itself in its ownmost potentiality-of-being. Anticipa­
tion makes Da-sein

authentically

futural in such a way that anticipation

itself is possible only in that Da-sein,

as existing,

always already comes

toward itself, that is, is futural in its being in general.

Anticipatory resoluteness understands Da-sein in its essential being­

guilty. This understanding means to take over being-guilty while existing,

to

be the thrown ground of nullity. But to take over thrownness means to
be Da-sein in the way that it always already was. Taking over

authentically

thrownness, however, is possible only in such a way that futural Da-sein

can be its ownmost "how it always already was, " that is, its "having-been."
Only because Da-sein in general is as I am-having-been, can it come futu-

Da-sein is authentically

Anticipation of the most extreme

Only as the

present,

in the sense of

making present, can resoluteness be what it is, namely, the undistorted
letting what it grasps in action be encountered.
Futurally coming back to itself, resoluteness brings itself to the
situation in making it present. Having-been arises from the future in
such a way that th<; future that has-been (or better, is in the process of
having-been) releases the present from itself. We call the unified phe­
nomenon of the future that makes present in the process of having­
been

temporality.

Only because Da-sein is determined as temporality

does it make possible for itself the authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole
of anticipatory resoluteness which we characterized.

Temporality reveals

itself a.s the meaning of authentic care.
The phenomenal content of this meaning, drawn from the consti­
tution of being of anticipatory resoluteness, fulfills the significance of the
term temporality. We must now keep the terminological use of this
expression at a distance from all of the meanings of "future, " "past," and
" present" initially urging themselves upon us from the vulgar concept of
time. That is also true of the concepts of a "subj ective" and an "objec­
tive," or an "immanent" and "transcendent" "time." Since Da-sein under­
stands itself initially and for the most part inauthentically, we may sup­
pose that the "time" of the vulgar understanding of time indeed presents
a genuine phenomenon, but a derivative one. It arises from inauthentic
temporality that has an origin of its own. The concepts of "future, "
" past," and "present" initially grew out o f th e inauthentic understanding

327

of time. The terminological definition of the corresponding primordial
and authentic phenomena battles with the same difficulty in which all
ontological terminology is stuck. In this field of inquiry, forcing things is
not an arbitrary matter, but a necessity rooted in facts. However, in
order to demonstrate the origin of inauthentic temporality from pri­
mordial and authentic temporality without any gap, we first need to
work out correctly the primordial phenomenon concretely, which we
have thus far only sketched out roughly.
If resoluteness constitutes the mode of authentic care, and if it is
itself possible only through temporality, the phenomenon at which we
arrived by considering resoluteness must itself only present a modality of
temporality, which makes care possible in general. The totality of being
of Da-sein as care means : Ahead-of-its elf-already-being-in (a world) as
being-together-with (beings encountered within the world). In first estalr
lishing this articulated structure, we referred to the fact that with regard
to this articulation the ontological question had to be taken back further

Being and Time

II.III

301

to the exposition o f the unity o f the totality o f th e structural manifold. 23

The primordial unity of the structure of care lies in temporality.

Being-ahead-of-oneself is grounded in the future. Already-being­

in . . . makes known having-been. Being-together-with . . . is made pos­
sible in making present. After what we have said, it is automatically
ruled out to conceive the "ahead" in the "ahead-of-itself" and the
"already" in terms of the vulgar understanding of time. The "ahead"
does not mean the "before" in the sense of a "not-yet-now, but later. "
Nor does the "already" mean a "no-longer-now, but earlier." If the
expressions "ahead of" and "already" had this temporal meaning, which
th ey can also have, then we would be saying about the temporality of
care that it is something that is "earlier" and "later," "not yet" and "no
longer" at the same time. Then care would be conceived as a being that
occurs and elapses "in time." The

being of a

being of the nature of Da­

sein would then turn into something objectively present. If this is impossible,
the temporal significance of these expressions must be a different one.
The "before" and the "ahead of" indicate the future that first makes
possible in general the fact that Da-sein can be in such a way that it is
concerned

about

its potentiality-of-being. The self-proj ect grounded in

the "for the sake of itself" in the future is an essential quality of

existen­

tiality. Its primary meaning is the future.
Similarly, the "already" means the existential, temporal meaning of
being of the being that, in that it

is,

is always already something thrown.

Only because care is grounded in having-been, can Da-sein exist as the
thrown being that it is. "As long as" Da-sein factically exists, it is never
past, but is always already

having-been

been." And only as long as Da-sein is,

in the sense of "l-am-as-having­

can

it

be

as having-been. On the

other hand, we call beings past that are no longer objectively present.
Thus existing Da-sein can never ascertain itself as an objectively present fact that comes into being and passes away "with time," and is
already partially past. It always "finds itself" only as a thrown fact. In

attunement

Da-sein is invaded by itself as the being that it still is and

already was, that is, that it constantly

is

as having been. The primary

existential meaning of facticity lies in having-been. The formulation of
the structure of care indicates the temporal meaning of existentiality
of fa cticity with the expressions "before" and "already."
On the other hand, such an indication is lacking for the third con­
stitutive factor of care: entangled being-together-with . . . . That is not
supposed to mean that falling prey is not also grounded in temporality;
it should instead intimate that making present, as the primary basis for the

falling prey to things at hand and objectively present that we take care of,
remains included in the future and in having-been in the mode of pri­
mordial temporality. Resolute, Da-sein has brought itself back out of

328

Being and Time

302

II.m

falling prey in order to be all the more authentically "there" for the dis­
closed situation in the "Moment" [Augenblick].

Temporality makes possible the unity of existence, facticity, and
falling prey and thus constitutes primordially the totality of the structure
of care. The factors of care are not pieced together cumulatively, any
more than temporality itself has first been put together out of future,
past, and present "in the course of time." Temporality "is" not a
all. It is not, but rather

temporalizes

being at

itself. Nevertheless, we still cannot

avoid saying that "temporality ' is' the meaning of care," " temporality
'is' determined thus and so." The reason for this can be made intelligible
only when we have clarified the idea of being and the "is" as such. Tem­
porality temporalizes, and it temporalizes possible ways of itself. These
make possible the multiplicity of the modes of being of Da-sein, in par­
ticular the fundamental possibility of authentic and inauthentic exis­
tence.
Future, having-been, and present show the phenomenal character­
istics of "toward itself," "back to," "letting something be encountered."

329

The phenomena of toward . . . , to . . . , together with . . . reveal tempo­

ekstatikon par excellence. Temporality is the primordial "outside of
itself' in and for itself. Thus we call the phenomena of future, having­
been, and present, the ecstasies of temporality. Temporality is not, prior to
this, a being that first emerges from itself, its essence is temporalizing in
the unity of the ecstasies. What is characteristic of the "time" accessible to
rality as the

the vulgar understanding consists, among other things, precisely in the
fact that it is a pure succession of nows, without beginning and without
end, in which the ecstatic character of primordial temporality is levelled
down. But this very levelling down, in accordance with its existential
meaning, is grounded in the possibility of a definite kind of temporaliz­
ing, in conformity with which temporality temporalizes as inauthentic
the kind of "time" we have just mentioned Thus if we demonstrate that
the "time" accessible to the common sense of Da-sein is

not primordial,

but arises rather from authentic temporality, then, according to the prin­
ciple

In enumerating the ecstasies, we have always mentioned the future
first. That should indicate that the future has priority in the ecstatic
unity of primordial and authentic temporality, although temporality
does not first originate through a cumulative sequence of the ecstasies,
but always temporalizes itself in their equiprimordiality. But within this
equiprimordiality, the modes of temporalizing are different. And the dif­
ference lies in the fact that temporalizing can be primarily determined
out of the different ecstasies. Primordial and authentic temporality tem­
poralizes itself out of the authentic future, and indeed in such a way that,

The primary phenomenon

of primordial and authentic temporality is the future.

The priority of the

future will itself vary according to the modified temporalizing of inau­
then tic tem porality, but it will still make its appearance in derivative

Care is being-toward-death. We defined anticipatory resoluteness

as authentic being toward the possibility that we characterized as the

absolute impossibility of Da-sein. In this being-toward-the-end, Da-sein

temporality which constitutes the meaning of anticipatory resoluteness,

"does time not go on?" And can there not be an unlimited number of
things that still lie "in the future" and arrive from it?

rality because they no longer deal with that at all . The question is not
how many things can still occur "in an ongoing time, " or about what
kind of a "letting-come-toward-oneself" we can encounter "out of this
time, " but about how the coming-toward-oneself is itself to be primor­
dially detennined

as such.

Its finitude does not primarily mean a stop­

ping, but is a characteristic of temporalizing itself. The primordial and
authentic future is the toward-oneself, toward

oneself,

existing as the

possibility of a nullity not-to-be-bypassed. The ecstatic quality of the pri­
mordial future lies precisely in the fact that it closes the potentiality-of­
being, that is, the future is itself closed and as such makes possible the

resolute existentiell understanding of nullity. Primordial and authentic

coming-toward-oneself is the meaning of existing in one's ownmost nul­

lity. With the thesis of the primordial finitude of temporality, we are not
contesting the fact that "time goes on." We are simply holding fast to the

phenomenal quality of primordial temporality that shows itself in what is
projected in the primordial existential project of Da-sein.
The temptation to overlook the finitude of the primordial and
authentic future and thus the finitude of temporality, or to think

a priori

that finitude is impossible, arises from the constant intrusion of the vul­

gar understanding of time. If the latter is justifiably familiar with an
endless time, and only with that, it has not yet been demonstrated that it
also understands this time and its "infinity." What does it mean to say
that time "goes on" and "keeps passing away"? What does "in time"
mean in general, and "in the future" and "out of the future" in particu­
lar? In what sense is "time" endless? These things require clarification if
the vulgar objections to the finitude of primordial time are not to

330

Being and TitlU!

remain without foundation. But we can clear them up only if we have
obtained the appropriate line of questioning with regard to finitude

and in finitude. However, this line of questioning arises only if we view
the primordial phenomenon of time understandingly. The problem is
not

33 1

how does "derivative,"

infinite time, "in which" objectively present

things come into being and pass away,

become primordial,

finite tempo­

rality, but rather, how does inauthentic temporality, as inauthentic, tem­
poralize an infinite time out of finite time? Only because primordial
time is finite can " derivative" time temporalize itself as

infinite.

In the

order in which we grasp things through the understanding, the finitude

of time does not become fully visible until we have set forth "endless
time" so that these may be contrasted.

Let us summarize the analysis of primordial temporality in the fol­

lowing theses: Time is primordial as the temporalizing of temporality,

and makes possible the constitution of the structure of care. Temporal­
ity is essentially ecstatic. Temporality temporalizes itself primordially
out of the future. Primordial time is finite.

Yet the interpretation of care as temporality cannot remain

restricted to the narro w basis we have so far attained, although it did

take the first steps toward the primordial, authentic being-a-whole of

Da-sein. The thesis that the meaning of Da-sein is temporality must be

confirmed by the concrete content of the fundamental constitution of
this being which we have set forth.

66. The Temporality oJDa-sein and the Tasks Arisingfrom It

of a More Primordial Retrieve of the Existential Analysis
The phenomenon of temporality which we have set forth requires not

only a more wide-ranging confirmation of its constitutive power, it itself
thus comes to view with regard to the fundamental possibilities of tem­

poralization. We shall briefly call the demonstration of the possibility of

the constitution of being of Da-sein on the basis of temporality, the

"temporal" interpretation, although this is only a provisional term.

Our next task is to go beyond the temporal analysis of the authen­

tic potentiality-of-being-a-whole of Da-sein and a general characteriza­
tion of the temporality of care, so that the

inauthenticity

of Da-sein may

be made visible in its specific temporality. Temporality first showed

i tself in anticipatory resoluteness. That is the authentic mode of dis­
closedness that for the most part stays within the inauthenticity of the

entangled self-interpretation of the they. The nature of the temporality
of disclosedness in general leads to the temporal understanding of that

heedful being-in-the-world nearest to us, and thus of the average indif-

332

ference of Da-sein from which the existential analytic first started.24 We

Being and Time

II.lll

305

call ed the average kind of being of Da-sein, in which it initially and for
th e mo st part stays, everydayness . By retrieving our earlier analysis,

everydayness

must be revealed in its

temporal meaning

so that the prob­

lema tic in cluded in temporality may come to light and the seeming
" obviousness" of our preparatory analyses may disappear completely.
Indeed, confirmation is to be found for temporality in all the essential
strUctures of the fundamental constitution of Da-sein. Yet that does not
lead us to repeat our analyses in the same external schema in the order
of their presentation. The course of our temporal analysis has a different
direction. It is to make the connection of our earlier reflections clearer
and to remove their chance character and seeming arbitrariness. How­
ever, beyond these necessities of method, there are valid motives in the
phenomenon itself that compel us to articulate our analysis in a different
way when we retrieve it.
The ontological strUcture of the being that I

myself always

am is

centered in the self-constancy of existence. Because the self cannot be
conceived either as substance or as subject, but is rather grounded in
existence, our analysis of the inauthentic self, the they, was left com­
pletely in the train of the preparatory interpretation of Da-sein.25 Now
that selfhood has been

explicitly

taken back into the structure of care, and

thus of temporality, the temporal interpretation of self-constancy and the
lack of self-constancy acquires an importance of its own. It requires a
special thematic development. But it not only gives us the right protec­
tions against the paralogisms and the ontologically inappropriate ques­
tion about the being of the I in general; at the same time it provides us,
in accordance with its central function, with a more primordial insight
into the

structure of the temporalizing of temporality. Temporality reveals
historicity of Da-sein. The statement that Da-sein is historical

itself as the

is confirmed as an existential and ontological fundamental proposition.
It is far removed from merely ontically ascertaining the fact that Da­
sein occurs in a "world history. " The historicity of Da-sein, however, is
the ground of a possible historiographical understanding that in its tum
harbors the possibility of getting a special grasp of the development of
historiography as a science.
The temporal interpretation of everydayness and historicity secures
the view of primordial time sufficiently to uncover it as the condition of
the possibility and necessity of the everyday experience of time. Da-sein

expends itself primarily for itself as

a being that is concerned about its

being, whether explicitly or not. Initially and for the most part, care is
circumspect taking care of things. Expending itself for the sake of itself,
Da-sein "uses itself up." Using itself up, Da-sein uses itself, that is, its
time. Using its time, it reckons with it. Taking care of things which is cir­
cumspect and reckoning, initially discovers time and develops a mea-

333

II. m

Being and Time

306

surement of time. Measurement of time is constitutive for being-in-the­
world. Measuring i ts time, the discovering of circumspection which
takes care of things lets what it discovers at hand and objectively present
be encountered in time. Innerworldly beings thus become accessible as
" existing in time." We shall call the temporal quality of innerworldly
beings

"within-time-ness."

The "time" initially found therein ontically

becomes the basis for the development of the vulgar and traditional
concept of time. But time as within-time-ness arises from an essential
kind of temporalization of primordial temporality. This origin means
that the time "in which" obj ectively present things come into being and
pass away is a genuine phenomenon of time; it is not an extemaliza­
tion of a "qualitative time" into space, as Bergson's interpretation of
time-which is ontologically completely indeterminate and insufficient­
would have it.
The elaboration of the temporality of Da-sein as everydayness, his­
toricity, and within-time-ness first gives uncluttered insight into the

plexities

com­

of a primordial ontology of Da-sein. As being-in-the-world Da­

sein exists factically together with beings encountered within the world.
Thus the being of Da-sein gets its comprehensive ontological trans­
parency only in the horizon of the clarified being of beings unlike Da­
sein, that is, even of what is not at hand and not objectively present, but
only "subsists." But if the variations of being are to be interpreted for
everything of which we say that it

is,

we need beforehand a sufficiently

clarified idea of being in general. As long as we have not reached this,
the retrieve of the temporal analysis of Da-sein will remain incomplete
and marred by lack of clarity, not to speak extensively of the factual dif­
ficulties. The existential-temporal analysis of Da-sein requires in its tum
a new retrieve in the context of a fundamental discussion of the concept
of being.

6 7. The Basic Content of the Existential Constitution of Da-sein,

and the Preliminary Sketch of Its Temporal Interpretation

Our preparatory analysis1 has made access ible a multiplicity of phe­
nomena that must not disappear from our phenomenological view, in
spite of our concentration on the foundational structural totality of
care. Far from excluding such a multiplicity, the primordial totality of the
constitution of being of Da-sein

as articulated demands

it. The primor­

diality of the constitution of Da-sein does not coincide with the simplic­
ity and uniqueness of an ultimate structural element. The ontological
origin of the being of Da-sein is not "less" than that which arises from it,
but exceeds it in power from the beginni ng. Any "arising" in the field of
ontology is degeneration. The ontological penetration to the " origin"
does not arrive at things which are ontically self-evident for the " com­
mon understanding," but rather it is precisely this that opens up the
questionability of everything self-evident.
In order to bring the phenomena at which we arrived in our
preparatory analysis back to a phenomenological view, a reference to the
s tages we have gone through will suffice. The delineation of care
emerged from our analysis of the disclosedness that consti tutes the
being of the " there . " The clarification of this phenomenon signified
that a preliminary interpretation of the basic constitution of Da-sein of
being-in-the-world was necessary. Our inquiry began with a characteri­
zation of being-in-the-world, and then went on to secure from the very
beginning an adequate phenomenal horizon as opposed to the inap-

307

308

II.IV

Being and Time

propriate ontological predeterminations of Da-sein that are mostly inex­
plicit. Being-in-the-world was initially characterized with regard to the
phenomenon of the world. Indeed, our explication moved from an
ontic and ontological characterization of the things at hand and obj ec­
tively present

"in"

the surrounding world to a delineation of inner­

worldliness, thus making the phenomenon of worldliness in general vis­
ible in innerworldliness. But the structure of worldliness, significance,
turned out to be coupled with that upon which the understanding essen­
tially belonging to disclosedness projects itself, with the potentiality-of­
b eing of Da-sein for the sake of which it exists .
The temporal interpretation o f everyday Da-sein must begin with

335

the structures in which disclosedness constitutes itself. These are: under­
standing, attunement, entanglement, and discourse. The modes of the
temporalizing of temporality to be exposed with regard to these phe­
nomena provide the basis for defining the temporality of being-in-the­
world. This leads again to the phenomenon of the world and permits us
to delineate the specifically temporal problematic of worldliness. It must
be confirmed by characterizing the everyday being-in-the-world nearest
to us-by entangled, circumspect taking care of things. The temporality
of taking care of things makes it possible for circumspection to be mod­
ified into a perceiving that looks at things and the theoretical knowledge
based on such perceiving. The temporality of being-in-the-world that
thus emerges at the same time turns out to be the foundation of the spe­
cific spatiality of Da-sein. The temporal constitution of de-distancing
and directionality must be shown. The whole of these analyses reveals a

possibility of temporalizing of temporality in which the inauthenticity of
Da-sein is ontologically grounded, and leads to the question of how the
temporal nature of everydayness-the temporal meaning of the "ini­
tially and for the most part," which we have continually been using-is to
be understood. Fixing upon this problem makes clear that the clarifica­
tion of the phenomenon that we have so far attained is not sufficient,
and we shall show the extent of this insufficiency.
The present chapter thus has the following articulation: the tem­
porality of disclosedness in general (section

68);

the temporality of

being-in-the-world and the problem of transcendence (section

69);

temporality of the spatiality commensurate with Da-sein (section

the

70);

the temporal meaning of the everydayness commensurate with Da-sein
( section

71).

Resoluteness, which we characterized with regard to its temporal mean­
ing, represents an authentic disclosedness of Da-sein. Disclosedness con-

Being and Time

stitutes a being in such a way that, existing, it can be itself its "There . "
Care was characterized with respect to its temporal meaning only in its
basic features. To demonstrate its concrete temporal constitution means
to interpret temporally its individual structural moments, that is, under­
standing, attunement, entanglement, and discourse. Every understand­
ing has its mood. Every attunement understands. Attuned understand­
ing has the characteristic of entangleme n t . En tangled, attuned
understanding articulates itself with regard to its intelligibility in dis­
course. The actual temporal constitution of these phenomena always
leads back to that

one

temporality that holds within itself the possible

structural unity of understanding, attunement, entanglement, and dis­
course.

(a) The Temporality of Understanding.2

understanding we
kind of cognition, as dis-

With the term

mean a fundamental existential; neither a definite

tinct from explaining and conceiving, nor a cognition in general in the
sense of grasping something thematically. Understanding constitutes
the being of the There in such a way that, on the basis of such under­
standing, a Da-sein in existing can develop the various possibilities of
sight, of looking around, and of just looking. As the understanding dis­
covery of what is unintelligible, all explanation is rooted in the primary
understanding of Da-sein.
Formulated primordially and existentially, understanding means: to
be projecting toward a potentiality-ofbeingfor the sake of which Da-sein always
exists. Understanding discloses one's own potentiality-of-being in such a
way that Da-sein always somehow knows understandingly what is going
on with itself. This "knowing," however, does not mean that it has dis­
covered some fact, but that it holds itself in an existentiell possibility.
The ignorance corresponding to this does not consist in a failure to
understand, but must be taken as a deficient mode of the projected­
ness of one's potentiality-of-being. Existence can be questionable. If it is
to be possible for something " to be in question," a disclosedness is nec­
essary. When one understands oneself projectively in an existentiell pos­
sibility, the future underlies this understanding, and it does so as a com­
ing-toward-oneself from the actual possibility as which Da-sein always
exists. The future makes ontologically possible a being that is in such a
way that it exists understandingly in its potentiality-of-being. Projecting,
which is fundamentally futural, does not primarily grasp the projected
possibility thematically by opening it, but throws itself into it as possi­
bility. Understandingly, Da-sein always

is

as it can be. Resoluteness

turned out to be primordial and authentic existing. Of course, initially
for the most part Da-sein remains irresolute, that is, it remains closed off
from its ownmost potentiality-of-being to which it always brings itself

336

310

ll.IV

Being and Time

only in individuation. This means that temporality does not temporalize
its elf constantly out of the authentic future. However, this inconstancy
does not mean that temporality at times lacks the future, but rather
that the temporalizing of the future is changeable.
We shall retain the expression

anticipation

for the terminological

characterization of the authentic future. It indicates that Da-sein, authen­
tically existing, lets itself come toward itself as its ownmost potentiality-

337

of-being-that the future must first win itself, not from a present, but
from the inauthentic future. The formally neutral term for the future lies
in the designation of the first structural factor of care, in

itself.

being-ahead-of

Factically, Da-sein is constantly ahead-of-itself, but in its existentiell

possibility inconstantly anticipatory.
How is the inauthentic future to be contrasted with this? As the
authentic future is revealed in resoluteness, the inauthentic future, as an
ecstatic mode, can reveal itself only by going back ontologically from the
everyday, inauthentic understanding taking care of things to its exis­
tential and temporal meaning. As care, Da-sein is essentially ahead-of­
itself. Initially and for the most part, the being-in-the-world that takes
care understands itself in terms of

understanding proj ects

what

it takes care of. Inauthenti c

itself upon what c an be taken care of, what can b e

done, what i s urgent or indispensable in the business o f everyday activ­
ity. But what is taken care of is as it is for the sake of the potentiality-of­
being that cares . This potentiality lets Da-sein come toward itself in its
heedful being together with what is to be taken care of. Da-sein does not
come toward itself primarily in its ownm ost, nonrelational potentiality­

of-being, but it

awaits this heedfully in terms of that which what is taken care
ofproduces or denies. Da-sein comes toward itself in terms of what is taken
care of. The inauthentic future has the character of awaiting. The s elf­
understanding of the they that takes care in terms of what one is doing,
has the "ground" of its possibility in this ecstatic mode of the future.
And

only because factical Da-sein is

thus

in terms of what is taken care of, can it

awaiting its potentiality-for-being
expect and wait for . . . . Awaiting

must always already have disclosed the horizon and scope in terms of
which something can be expected.

Expecting is a motk of thefuturefountkd
in awaiting that temporalizes itself authentically as anticipation. Thus a more

primordial being-toward-death lies in anticipation than in the heedful
expecting of it.
Existing in the potentiality-of-being, however it may be proj ected,
understanding is primarily futural. But it would not temporalize itself if
it were not temporal, that is, equiprimordially determined by having­
been and the present. The way in which the ecstasy of the present helps
constitute inauthentic understanding was already made roughly clear.
Everyday taking care of things understands itself in terms of the paten-

II. IV

Being and Time

311

tiality-of-being that confronts i t as coming from its possible success or
failure with regard to what is actually taken care of. Corresponding to
the inauthentic future (awaiting), its own way of being together with what
is taken care of. The ecstatic mode of this present reveals itself if we
adduce for comparison this very same ecstasy, but in the mode of
authentic temporality. To the anticipation of resoluteness there belongs
a present in keeping with which a resolution discloses the situation. In
resoluteness, the present is not only brought back from the dispersion in
what is taken care of nearest at hand, but is held in the future and hav­
ing-been. We call the present that is held in authentic temporality, and is
thus authentic, the Momen t. This term must be understood in the active
sense as an ecstasy. It means the resolute raptness of Da-sein, which is yet
held in resoluteness, in what is encountered as possibilities and circum­
stances to be taken care of in the situation. The phenomenon of the
Moment can in principle not be clarified in terms of the now. The now is
a temporal phenomenon that belongs to time as within-time-ness: the
now "in which" something comes into being, passes away, or is objectively present. "In the Moment" nothing can happen, but as an authentic present it lets us encounterfor thefirst time what can be "in a time" as
something at hand or objectively present.'
In contrast to the Moment as the authentic present, we shall call
the inauthentic present making present. Understood formally, every pre­
sent makes present, but not every present is "in the moment." When we
use the expression making present with no additional qualification, we
always mean the inauthentic kind, which is irresolute and lacking the
Moment. Making present will become clear only in terms of the tempo­
ral interpretation of falling prey to the "world" taken care of; this falling
prey has its existential meaning in making present. But since inauthentic
understanding projects its potentiality-of-being in terms of what can be
taken care of, this means that it temporalizes itself in terms of making
present. The Moment, on the other hand, temporalizes itself out of the
authentic future.
Inauthentic understanding temporalizes itself as an awaiting that
makes present-an awaiting to whose ecstatic unity a corresponding having-been must belong. The authentic coming-toward-itself of anticipatory resoluteness is at the same time a coming back to the ownm ost self
thrown into its individuation. This ecstasy makes it possible for Da-sein
to be able to take over resolutely the being that it already is. In antici­
pation, Da-sein brings itself forth again to its ownmost potentiality-ofbeing. We call authentic having-been retrieve. But when one projects oneself inauthentically upon the possibilities drawn from what is taken care
o f in making it present, this is possible only because Da-sein has forgotten
its elf in its ownmost thrown potentiality-of-being. This forgetting is not

338

339

312

Being and Time

II.IV

nothing, nor is it just a failure to remember; it is rather a "positive,"
ecstatic mode of having-been; a mode with a character of its own. The
ecstasy (rapture) of forgetting has the character of backing away from
one's ownmost having-been in a way that is closed off from oneself.
This backing away from . . . ecstatically closes off what it is backing away
from, and thus closes itself off, too. As inauthentic having-been, forgot­
tenness is thus related to its own thrown being. It is the temporal mean­
ing of the kind of being that I initially and for the most part am as hav­
ing-been. And only on the basis of this forgetting can the making present
that takes care of and awaits retain things, retain beings unlike Da-sein
encountered in the surrounding world. To this retention corresponds a
nonretention that presents us with a kind of "forgetting" in the deriva­
tive sense.
Just as expectation is possible only on the basis of awaiting, remem·
bering is possible only on the basis of forgetting, and not the other way
around. In the mode of forgottenness, having-been primarily "discloses"
the horizon in which Da-sein, lost in the "superficiality" of what is taken
care of, can remember. Awaiting that forgets and makes present is an
ecstatic unity in its own right, in accordance with which inauthentic
understanding temporalizes itself with regard to its temporality. The
unity of these ecstasies closes off one's authentic potentiality-of-being,
and is thus the existential condition of the possibility of irresoluteness.
Although inauthentic heedful understanding is determined in the light
of making present what is taken care of, the temporalizing of under­
standing comes about primarily in the future.

340

(b) The Temporality of Attunement. 4 Understanding is never free floating,
but always attuned. The there is equiprimordially disclosed by mood, or
else closed off. Attunement brings Da-sein before its thrownness in such
a way that the latter is not known as such, but is disclosed far more pri­
mordially in "how one is." Being thrown means existentially to find one­
self in such and such a way. Thus attunement is grounded in thrown­
ness. Mood represents the way in which I am always primarily the being
that has been thrown. How can the temporal constitution of attune­
ment become visible? How can we gain insight into the existential con­
nection between attunement and understanding in terms of the ecstatic
unity of actual temporality?
Mood discloses by turning away from and toward one's own Da­
sein. Whether authentically revealing or inauthentically concealing,
bringing Da-sein before the That of its own throwness is existentially pos­
sible only if the being of Da-sein, by its very meaning is as constantly hav­
ing-been. Having-been does not first bring one face to face with the
thrown being that one is oneself, but the ecstasy of having-been first

II. IV

Being and Time

313

makes pos sible finding oneself in the mode of how-I-find-myself. Under­
standing is primarily grounded in the future; attunement, on the other
hand, temporalizes itself primarily in having-been. Mood temporalizes
itself, that is, its specific ecstasy belongs to a future and a present, but in
such a way that having-been modifies the equiprimordial ecstasies.
We emphasized the fact that whereas moods are ontically familiar,
they are not cognized in their primordial and existential function. They
are taken as fleeting experiences that "color" one's whole "psychical
condition." Whatever can be observed as having the nature of a fleeting
appearance and disappearance belongs to the primordial constancy of
existence. But, nevertheless, what should moods have in common with
"time"? It is a trivial established fact that these "experiences" come and
go, that they run their course "in time," certainly an ontic and psycho­
logical fact. But our task is to demonstrate the ontological structure of
attunement in its existential and temporal constitution. And this is initially only a matter of first making the temporality of mood visible. The
thesis that "attunement is primarily grounded in having-been" means
that the existential fundamental nature of mood is a bringing back to . . . .
This does not first produce having-been, but attunement always reveals
a mode of having-been for the existential analysis. Thus the temporal
interpretation of attunement cannot have the intention of deducing
moods from temporality and dissolving them in the pure phenomena of
temporalizing. We solely want to show that moods are not possible in
what they "signify" existentielly or how they "signify" it except on the bosis
of temporality. Our temporal interpretation will restrict itself to the phe­
nomena of fear and Ang;5t, which were already analyzed in a preparatory
way.
We shall begin our analysis by exhibiting the temporality ofjear.5
Fear was characterized as inauthentic attunement. Why does the exis­
tential meaning that makes such an attunement possible lie in what has
been? What mode of this ecstasy characterizes the specific temporality of
fear? Fear is a fear of something threatening-of something that is detri­
mental to the factical potentiality-of-being of Da-sein, and approaches
within the scope of the things at hand and objectively present being
taken care of in the manner described. Fearing discloses something
threatening in the mode of everyday circumspection. A subject that
merely looks could never discover anything like this. But is not this dis­
closing of fear of . . . a letting something-come-toward-oneself? Has not
fear been justifiably described as the expectation of a coming evil (malum
futurum)? Is not the primary temporal meaning of fear the future and
not at all having-been? Fearing is incontestably "related" not only to
"something futural" in the sense of what first arrives "in time," but this
relatedness itself is futural in the primordially temporal sense. Await-

34 1

314

II. IV

Being and Time

ing obviously also belongs

to the existential and temporal constitution of

fear. But this initially only means that the temporality of fear is

thentic.

inau·

Is the fear of . . . merely the expectation of something futurally

threatening? The expectation of something futurally threatening need
not already be fear, and it is so far from being fear that it lacks the spe­
cific mood character of fear. In fear, the awaiting of fear lets what is
threatening

come back

to one's potentiality-of-being factically taking care

of things. Only if that to which this comes back is already ecstatically
open, can what is threatening be awaited

back to the being that I am, and
affect of

only so can Da-sein be threatened. The character of mood and

fear lies in the fact that the awaiting that fears is afraid "for itself," that is,
fear of is a fearing

about. The existential and temporal meaning of fear is

constituted by a self-forgetting: the confused backing away from one's
own factical potentiality-of-being, which is threatened being-in-the-world

342

taking care of what is at hand. Aristotle correctly defines fear as

he tarake,

lupe tis

as depression or confusion.6 Depression forces Da-sein back to

its thrownness, but in such a way that its thrownness is precisely closed
off. Confusion is based upon forgetting. When one forgets and backs
away from a factical, resolute potentiality-of-being, one keeps to those
possibilities of self-preservation and evasion that have already been cir­
cumspectly discovered beforehand. Taking care of things which fears for
itself leaps from one thing to the other, because it forgets itself and
thus cannot grasp any definite possibility. All "possible" possibilities offer
themselves, and that means impossible ones, too . He who fears for him­
self stops at none of these-the "surrounding world" does not disap­
pear-but he encounters it in the mode of no longer knowing his way
around in

it.

This

confused making present

of the nearest best thing

belongs to forgetting oneself in fear. That, for example, the inhabitants
of a burning house often "save" the most unimportant things nearby is
known. When one has forgotten oneself and makes present a jumble of
unattached possibilities, one thus makes possible the confusion that
cons titutes the nature of the mood of fear. The forgottenness of confu­
sion also modifies awaiting, and characterizes it as depressed or con­
fused awaiting that is distinguished from pure expectation.
The specific, ecstatic unity that makes fearing for oneself existen­
tially possible, temporalizes itself primarily out of the forgetting we
described that, as a mode of having-been, modifies its present and its
future in their temporalizing. The temporality of fear is a forgetting that
awaits and makes present. In accordance with its orientation toward
things encountered within the world, the commonsense interpretation of
fear initially seeks to detennine the "approaching evil" as what it is afraid
of and to define its relation to that evil as expectation. What belongs to
the phenomenon beyond that remains a "feeling of pleasure or pain."

familiar being-in-the-world.Just like fear, Ang.5t is formally determined by
something

in the face of which one is anxious and something about which

one is anxious. However, our analysis showed that these two phenomena
coincide. That is not supposed to mean that their structural characteristics are fused, as if

Ang.5t were anxious neither in

the face of anything

nor about anything. Their coincidence means that the being exhibiting
these structures is the same, namely Da-sein. In particular, that in the
face of which one has

Ang.rt is not encountered as something definite to

be taken care of; the threat does not come from something at hand
and objectively present, but rather from the fact that everything at hand
and objectively present absolutely has nothing more to "say" to us.
Beings in the surrounding world are no longer relevant. The world in
which I exist has sunk into insignificance, and the world thus disclosed
can set free only beings that are not relevant. The nothingness of the
world in the face of which

Angst

is anxious does not mean that an

absence of innerworldly things objectively present is experienced in

Ang.5t. They must be encountered in just such a way that they are of no
releuance at all, but can show themselves in a barren mercilessness. However, this means that our heedful awaiting finds nothing in terms of
which it could understand itself, it grasps at the nothingness of the

world. But, thrust toward the world, understanding is brought by
to being-in-the-world as such. Being-in-the-world is both what

anxious in the face of and what it is anxious about. Being anxious in the
face of . . . neither has the nature of an expectation nor of an awaiting at
all . That in the face of which one has Ang.5t is, after all, already "there"; it
is Da-sein itself. Then is not

Ang.5t

constituted by a future? Certainly,

yet not by the inauthentic one of awaiting.
The insignificance of the world disclosed in Ang.rt reveals the nullity
of what can be taken care of, that is, the impossibility of projecting one­
self upon a potentiality-of-being primarily based upon what is taken care
of. But the revelation of this impossibility means to let the possibility of
an authentic potentiality-of-being shine forth. What is the temporal
meaning of this revealing?

Ang.5t is anxious about naked Da-sein thrown

into uncanniness. It brings one back to the pure That of one's own­
most, individuated thrownness. This bringing back has neither the char­
acter of an evasive forgetting, nor that of a remembering. But neither
does

Ang.5t

already imply that one has already taken over one's exis­

tence in resolution and is retrieving it. On the contrary, Ang.rt brings one
back to thrownness as something to be poss ibly

retrieved. And thus it also

reveals the possibility of an authentic potentiality-of-being that must, as

343

316

II.IV

Being and Time

something futural in retrieving, come back to the thrown There. Bring·
ing before the possibility of retrieval is the specifu ecstatic mode of the attunement
of the having-been that constitutes Angst

344

The forgetting constitutive for fear confuses Da-sein and lets it
s tray back and forth between ungrasped "worldly" possibilities. In con­
trast to this frantic making present, the present of Ang.st is

held in bring­

ing oneself back to one's ownm ost thrownness. In accordance with its
existential meaning,

Ang.st canno t lose

itself in what can be taken care of.

If something like this happens in an attunement similar to it, this is
fear, which everyday understanding mixes up with

as which it, and only it, is possible.

In the peculiar temporality of Ang:s-t, in the fact that it is primor­
dially grounded in having-been, and only out of this do future and pre­
sent temporalize themselves, the possibility was shown of the powerful­
ness that distinguishes the mood of Ang:s-t. In it, Da-sein is taken back

Although both modes of attunement, fear and Ang:s-t, are primarily

having-been,

yet their origin is different with regard to the

temporalizing belonging to each in the totality of care.

345

Ang:s-t arises

from

the future of resoluteness, while fear arises from the lost present of
which fear is fearfully apprehensive, thus fall i ng prey to it more than
ever.
But is not the thesis of the temporality of moods perhaps valid
only for the phenomena that we selected? How is a temporal meaning to
be found in the pallid lack of mood that dominates the "gray everyday"?

II .tV

Being and Time

317

And how about the temporality o f moods and affects such as hope, joy,
enthusiasm, and gaiety? That not only fear and Ang3t are founded exis­

tentially in a having-been, but other moods, too, becomes clear if we just
mention such phenomena as boredom [Uberdruss ], sadness, melancholy,

and despair. However, these must be interpreted on the broader basis of
a developed existential analytic of Da-sein. But even such a phenomenon

as hope, which seems to be completely founded in the future, must be

analyzed in a way similar to fear. In contrast to fear which is related to a

malum futurum, hope has been characterized as the expectation of a
bonum futurum. But what is decisive for the structure of hope as a phe­
nomenon is not so much the "futural" character of that to which it is
related as the existential meaning of hoping itself. Here, too, the mood
character lies primarily in hoping as hoping somethingfor oneself. He who
hopes takes himself, so to speak, along in the hope and brings himself
toward what is hoped for. But that presupposes having-gained-oneself.

The fact that hope

brings relief from

depressing anxiousness only means

that even this attunement remains related to a burden in the mode of

having-been. Elevated or elevating moods are ontologically possible only

in an ecstatic-temporal relation of Da-sein to the thrown ground of itself.
The palli d lack of mood of indifference to everything, which clings

to nothing and urges to nothing, and which goes along with what the day

brings, yet in a way takes everything with it, demonstrates in the most
penetrating fashion the power offorgetting in the everyday moods of taking
care of what is nearby. just barely living, which "lets everything alone" as

it is, is grounded in giving oneself over to thrownness and forgetting. It

has the ecstatic meaning of an inauthentic having-been. Indifference,

which can go along with busying oneself head over heels, is to be sharply
distinguished from equanimity.

This mood

arises from the resoluteness

that, in the Moment, has its view to the possible situations of the poten­
tiality-of-being-a-whole disclosed in the anticipation of death.

Only beings that in accordance with the meaning of their being are

attuned, that is, existing, have always already been and exist in a constant
mode of having-been can be affected. Ontologically, affection presup-

poses making present in such a way that in it Da-sein can be brought
back to itself as having-been. How the

stimulation

and

touching

of the

senses in beings that are simply alive are to be ontologically defmed, how

and where in general the being of animals is constituted, for example, by
a "time," remains a problem for itself.

(c) The Temporality ofFalling Prey. 8

The temporal interpretation of under­

standing and attunement not only came up against a primary ecstasy for
each of these phenomena, but at the same tim e always came up against
temporality as a whole. Just as the future primarily makes understanding

346

3 18

II.IV

Being and Time

possible, and having-been makes mood possible, the third constitutive
factor of care, falling prey, has its existential meaning in the

present.

Our preparatory analysis of falling prey began with an interpretation of
idle chatter, curiosity, and ambiguity 9
Our temporal analysis of falling prey should follow the same path.
We shall restrict our inquiry, however, to a consideration of curiosity
because in it the specific temporality of falling prey is most easily seen.
H owever, our analysis of idle chatter and ambiguity already presup­
poses a clarification of the temporal constitution of discourse and mean­
ing (interpretation).

Curiosity is an eminent tendency of being of Da-sein in accordance
with which Da-sein takes care of a potentiality of seeing. 10 Like the con­
cept of sight, "seeing" is not limited to perceiving with the "physical
eyes . " Perceiving in the broader sense lets what is at hand and objec­
tively present be "bodily" encountered with regard to their outward
appearance . This letting s omething be encountered is grounded in a
present. This present provides the ecstatic horizon in general within
which beings can be bodily present. Curiosity, however, does not make
present what is obj ectively present in order to
with it, but it s eeks to see

only

understand

it, staying

in order to see and have seen. As this

making present that gets tangled up in itself, curiosity has an ecstatic

34 7

unity with a corresponding future and having-been. Greed for the new
indeed penetrates to something not yet seen, but in such a way that
making present attempts to withdraw from awaiting. Curiosity is alto­
gether inauthentically futural, in such a way that it does not await a

possibility

but in i ts greed only desires possibility as something real.

Curiosity is constituted by a dispersed making present that, only making
present, thus constantly tries to run away from the awaiting in which it
is nevertheless " held, " although in a dispersed way. The present "arises
from" the awaiting that belongs to it in the sense of running away from
it that we emphasized. But the making present of curiosity that " arises"
is so little interested in the "matter in question" that, as soon as it catches

sight of it, it already is looking for the next thing. The making present

that "arises" from the awaiting of a definite, grasped possibility makes
possible ontologically the

not-staying that is

distinctive of curiosity.

Mak­

ing present does not "arise" from awaiting in such a way that it, so to
speak, disengages itself from awaiting and leaves it to itself, ontically
understood. "Arising" is an ecstatic modification of awaiting in such a
way that awaiting pursues making present. Awaiting gives itself up, so to
speak; it no longer lets inauthentic possibilities of taking care of things
come toward it from what is taken care of, unless they serve the purpose
of an impatient making present. When awaiting is ecstatically modified
by a making present that no longer arises, but pursues, this modification

II. IV

Being and Time

319

is the exis tential and temporal condition o f th e possibility o f dispersion.
Making present is left more and more to itself as it is modified by
the awaiting that pursues. It makes present for the sake of the present.
Thus tangled up in itself, the dispersed not-staying turns into the inabil­
ity to stay at all. This mode of the present is the most extreme opposite
phenomenon to the Moment. In this inability Da-sein is everywhere and
nowhere. The Moment brings existence to the situation and discloses the
authen tic "There. "
The more inauthentic th e present is, that is, the more making pre­
sent comes to "itself," the more it flees from a definite potentiality-of­
being and closes it off. But then the future can hardly come back at all to
the being that has been thrown. In the "arising" of the present, one also
forgets increasingly. The fact that curiosity always already keeps to what
is nearest by, and has forgotten what went before, is not something
resulting.from curiosity, but the ontological condition for curiosity itself.
With regard to their temporal meaning, the characteristics of
falling prey that we described-temptation, tranquillization, alienation,
and self-entanglement-mean that the making present that "arises" seeks
to temporalize itself out of itself in accordance with its ecstatic tendency. Da-sein entangles itself, and this determination has an ecstatic
meaning. The raptness of existence in making present does not mean
that Da-sein is separated from its I and its self. Even in the most extreme
making present, it remains temporal, that is, awaiting and forgetting.
Even in making present, Da-sein still understands itself, although it is
alienated from its ownmost potentiality-of-being that is primarily
grounded in the authentic future and having-been. But since making
present always offers something "new," it does not let Da-sein come
back to itself and constantly tranquillizes it anew. But this tranquillization again enforces the tendency toward arising. Curiosity is "brought
about" not by the endless immensity of what has not yet been seen, but
rather by the entangled kind of temporalizing of the arising present.
Even if one has seen everything, curiosity invents new things.
The mode of temporalizing of the "arising" of the present is
grounded in the essence of temporality, which is finite. Thrown into
being-toward-death, Da-sein initially and for the most part flees from
this more or less explicitly revealed thrownness. The present arises from
its authentic future and having-been, so that it lets Da-sein come to
authentic existence only by taking a detour through that present. The
origin of the "arising" of the present, that is, of being entangled in lost­
ness, is the primordial, authentic temporality itself that makes possible
thrown being-toward-death.
The thrownness before which Da-sein can indeed be brought authen­
tically and in which it can authentically understand itself yet remains

348

320

II. IV

Being and Time

dosed off from it with regard to where it comes from and how it comes
ontically. But this dosed-off-ness is by no means only a factually existent
lack of knowledge, but constitutes the facticity of Da-sein. It also deter­
mines the

ecstatic nature of existence,

left to the null ground of itself.

Initially, the throw of being-thrown-into-the-world does not authen­
tically get caught by Da-sein. The "movement" in it does not already
come to a "stand" because Da-sein "is there." Da-sein is swept along in
thrownness, that is, as something thrown into the world, it loses itself in
the "world" in its being factically dependent on what is to be taken care
of. The present, which constitutes the existential meaning of being swept
along, never acquires another ecstatic horizon of its own accord, unless

349

i t is brought back from its lostness by a resolution so that both the
actual situation and thus the primordial "boundary situation" of being­
toward-death are disclosed as the held Moment.

(d) The Temporality of Discourse. 11

The complete disdosedness of the

There cons tituted by understanding, attunement, and falling prey is
articulated by discourse. Thus discourse does not temporalize itself pri­
marily in a definite ecstasy. But since discourse is for the most part spo­
ken in language and initially speaks by addressing the "surrounding
world" in taking care of it and talking about it,

making present

has, of

course, a privileged constitutive function.
Tenses, like the other temporal phenomena of language-"kinds of
action" and " temporal stages"-do not originate from the fact that dis­
course "also" speaks about " temporal" processes, namely, processes that
are encountered "in time." Nor does the reason for this lie in the fact
that speaking occurs "in psychical time. " Discourse is

in itself temporal,

since all speaking about . . . , of . . . , or to . . . is grounded in the ecstatic
unity of temporality. The

kinds of action

are rooted in the primordial

temporality of taking care of things, whether it is related to things within
time or not. With the help of the vulgar and traditional concept of time
which linguis tics is forced to make use of, the problem of the existential
and temporal structure of the kinds of action

cannot even be formulated. 12

But because discourse is always talking about beings, although not pri­
marily and predominantly in the sense of theoretical statements, our
analysis of the temporal constitution of discourse and the explication of
the temporal characteristics of language pattems can be tackled only if
the problem of the fundamental connection between being and truth
has been unfolded in terms of the problematic of temporality. Then
the ontological meaning of the "is" can be defined, which a superficial
theory of propositions and judgments has distorted into the "copula."
The "origination" of "significance" can be clarified and the possibility of
the formulation of concepts can be made ontologically intelligible only

Being and Time

321

in terms of the temporality o f discourse, that i s , o f Da-sein i n general.
Understanding is grounded primarily in the future (anticipation or

350

awaiting) . Attunement temporalizes itself primarily in having-been

(retrieve or forgottenness). Falli ng prey is temporally rooted primarily in

the present (making present or the Moment). Still, understanding is

always a present that "has-been." Still, attunement temporalizes itself

as a future that "makes present. " Still, the present "arises" from or is

held by a future that has-been. From this it becomes evident that temporality temporalizes itself completely in troery ecstasy, that is, in the ecstatic unity
of the actua� complete temporalizing, of temporality is grounded the totality of
the structural whole of existence, facticity, and falling prey, that is, the unity of
the structure of care.
Temporalizing does not mean a "succession" of the ecstasies. The

future is

not later than

the having-been, and the having-been is

not earlier

than the present. Temporality temporalizes itself as a future that makes

present, in the process of having-been.

The disclosedness of the There and the fundamental existentiell

possibilities of Da-sein, authenticity and inauthenticity, are founded in

temporality. But disclosedness always pertains equiprimordiall y to the

whole of being-in-the-world, to being-in as well as the world. In orienta­
tion toward the temporal constitution of disclosedness we must thus

be able to demonstrate the ontological condition of the possibility that
there can be beings that exist as being-in-the-world.

69. The Temporality of Being-in-the-World and the

Problem of the Transcendence of the World
The ecstatic unity of temporality-that is, the unity of the "outside-itself'

in the raptures of the future, the having-been, and the present-is the

condition of the possibility that there can be a being that exists as its
"There." The being that bears the name Da-sein is "cleared." 1 ' The light
that constitutes this clearedness of Da-sein is not a power or source,

objectively present ontically, for a radiant brightness sometimes occurring

in this being. What essentially clears this being, that is, makes it "open" as

well as "bright" for itself, was defined as care, before any "temporal"
interpretation. The full disclosedness of the There is grounded in care.

This clearedness first makes possible any illumination or throwing light,

any perceiving, "seeing," or having of something. We understand the

light of this clearedness only if we do not look for an innate, objectively
present power, but rather question the whole constitution of being of Dasein, care, as to the unified ground of its existential possibility.

porality clears the There primordially.

Ecstatic tem­

It is the primary regulator of the pos-

sible unity of all the essential existential structures of Da-sein.

35 1

322

352

Being and Time

II. IV

Only in terms of the rootedness of Da-sein in temporality, do we
gain insight into the existential possibility of the phenomenon that we
characterized at the beginning of our analytic of Da-sein as the funda­
mental constitution of being-in-the-world. At the beginning, it was a matter
of securing the inseparable, structural unity of this phenomenon. The
question of the ground of the possible unity of this articulated structure
remained in the background. With the intention of protecting the phe­
nomenon from the most obvious and thus the most fatal tendencies to
divide it up, the everyday mode of being-in-the-world nearest to us-tak­
ing care of innerworldly beings at hand-was interpreted more exten­
sively. Now that care itself has been ontologically defined and traced
back to temporality as its existential ground, taking care in its turn can be
conceived explicitly in terms of care or temporality.
Our analysis of the temporality of taking care of things initially
kept to the mode of circumspectly having to do with things at hand.
Then it followed up the existential and temporal possibility that cir­
cumspect taking care may be modified into a discovering of innerworldly
beings in the sense of certain possibilities of scientific investigation and
discovering them by "merely" looking at them. Our interpretation of the
temporality of the being together with innerworldly things at hand and
objectively present-being together circumspectly as well as theoretically
taking care-shows at the same time how the same temporality is already
the advance condition of the possibility of being-in-the-world in which
being together with innerworldly beings is grounded as such. The the­
matic analysis of the temporal constitution of being-in-the-world led to
the question: how is something like world possible at all, in what sense is
world, what and how does the world transcend, how are "independent"
innerworldly beings "connected" with the transcending world? The onto­
logical exposition of these questions does not already entail their answer.
On the other hand, they do bring about the clarification, previously
necessary, of the structures with reference to which the problem of tran­
scendence is to be interrogated. The existential and temporal interpretation of being-in-the-world will consider three things: (a) the temporal­
i ty of circumspect taking care; (b) the temporal meaning of the
modification of circumspect taking care into theoretical knowledge of
innerworldly things objectively present; (c) the temporal problem of
the transcendence of the world.

(a) The Temporality of Circumspect Taking Care. How are we to gain the
perspective for an analysis of the temporality of taking care? We called
heedful being together with the "world" our association in and with the
surrounding world. 14 As examples of the phenomena of being together
with . . . we chose the using, handling, and producing of things at hand

II. IV

Being and Time

323

an d their deficient and undifferentiated modes , that i s , the being
togeth er with things that belong to everyday need.15 The authentic exis­
tence of Da-sein also has to do with such taking care, even when it

remains "indifferent" for it. Things at hand taken care of are not the

cause of taking care, as if this were to arise only on the basis of the

effects of innerworldly beings . Being together with things at hand can

neither be explained ontically in terms of those things at hand nor can

things at hand be derived from this kind of being. Taking care, as a

kind of being of Da-sein, and things taken care of, as innerworldly things
at hand, are, however, not simply

objectively present together.

Neverthe­

less, there is a "connection" between them. What is associated with, if
correctly understood, sheds light on heedful association itself. On the

other hand, if we miss the phenomenal structure of what is associated

with, we fail to recognize the existential constitution of this kind of

behavior. It is indeed already an essential gain for the analysis of the

beings encountered nearest to us if their specific handy character is not

omitted. But we must understand further that heedful association never

has to do with a single useful thing. Using and handling a definite useful

thing remains as such oriented toward a context of useful things. If, for

example, we look for a "misplaced" useful thing, we do not mean by this
simply and primarily only what is looked for in an isolated "act," but the

context of the whole of useful things has already been discovered. Any

"going to work" and starting out does not meet up with a useful thing

given in isolation out of nothing, but in taking hold of a useful thing we
come back to the useful thing grasped from the work-world that has

always already been disclosed.

If in our analysis of having to do with things, we aim at what we

have to do with, our existent being together with beings taken care of

must be given an orientation not toward an isolated useful thing at

hand, but rather toward the totality of useful things. Our reflection
relevance, 16

upon the eminent character of being of useful things at hand,

also forces us to this conception of what we have to do with. We under-

stand the term relevance ontologically . The phrase "something is in a
certain relevance" is not supposed to ontically ascertain a fact, but to

indicate the kind of being of things at hand. The relational character of
relevance, with its . . . together with . . . points to the fact that

a

useful

thing is ontologically impossible. Indeed, a single useful thing may be at

hand while another is "missing." But here the fact makes itself known
that one thing at hand belongs

to

the other. Heedful association can

only let things at hand be encountered circumspectly if it already under­

s tands something like a rel evance in whi ch things are. The being
toge ther with . . . that takes care in a way that circumspectly discovers

amounts to letting something be in relevance, that is, to projecting rei-

353

324

Being and Time

II.IV

evance understandingly. If letting things be relevant constitutes the existential
structure of taking care, and if the latter as being together with . . . belongs to the
essential constitution of care, and if care in its tum is grounded in temporality,
then the existential condition of the possibility of letting something be relevant
must be sought in a mode of the temporalizing of temporality.
Letting something be relevant lies in the simplest handling of a use­
ful thing. Relevance has an intentional character with reference to which
the thing is useable or in use. Understanding the intention and context
of relevance has the temporal structure of awaiting. Awaiting the inten­
tion, taking care can at the same time come back to something like rel­
evance.

Awaiting the context and retaining the means

of relevance make

p ossible in its ecstatic unity the specifically handy way in which the use­
ful thing is made present.
Awaiting the intention is neither a reflection upon the "goal" nor
an expectation of the imminent completion of the work to be produced.
It does not have the nature of a thematic grasping at all . Nor does retain­
ing what is relevant mean holding fast to it thematically . Handling things
is no more related merely to what it handles than to what it uses in rel-

354

evance. Rather, being relevant constitutes itself in the unity of awaiting
and retaining in such a way that the making present arising from this
makes the characteristic absorption in taking care in the world of its
useful things possible. When one is "really" busy with . . . and totally
immersed in it, one is neither only together with the work nor with the
tools nor with both "together." Being in relevance, which is grounded in
temporality, has already founded the unity of the relations in which tak­
ing care of things "moves" circumspectly.
A specific kind of forgetting is essential for the temporality that
constitutes being in relevance. In order to be able to "really" get to
work "lost" in the world of tools and to handle them, the self must forget
itself. But since an

awaiting is

always guiding in the unity of the tempo­

ralizing of taking care, the ownmost potentiality-of-being of Da-sein, tak­
ing care is nevertheless placed in care, as we shall show.
The making present that awaits and retains constitutes the famil­
iarity in accordance with which Da-sein "knows its way around" as being­
with-one-another in the public surrounding world. We understand let­
ting things be in relevance exis tentially as letting-"be." On i ts basis,
things at hand can be encountered by circumspection

as the beings

that

they are. We can thus further clarify the temporality of taking care if we
p ay attenti on to

the

modes of circu m s p ec tly letting something b e

encountered that were characterized before17 as conspicuousness, obtru­
siveness, and obstinacy. The useful thing at hand is precisely not encoun­
tered with regard to its "true in-itself' by a thematic perception of things,
but is encountered in the inconspicuousness of what is found " obvi-

II .IV

Being and Time

325

ously" and "objectively." But if something is conspicuous in the totality
of these beings, herein lies the possibility that the totality of useful things
as such also obtrudes itself. How must letting things be in relevance be
structured existentially so that it can let something conspicuous be
encountered? This question is not aiming at factical occasions that direct
attention to something already presented, but at the ontological mean­
ing of this directability as such.
Things that cannot be used, for example, a tool that will not work,
can be conspicuous only in and for someone using them. Even the most
sharp and persistent "perception" and "representation" of things could
never discover something like damage to the tool. The using must be
able to be hampered so that something unhandy can be encountered.
But what does this mean ontologically? The making present that awaits
and retains is held up with regard to its absorption in the relevant relations, and it is held up by something which afterwards turns out to be a
damage. The making present, which equiprimordially awaits the whatfor, is held fast with the tool used in such as way that the what-for and
the in-order-to are now explicitly encountered for the first time. However, making present itself can only meet up with something unsuited
for . . . because it is already moving in an awaiting retention of what is in
relevance. Making present is "held up," that is, in the unity of the awaiting that retains, it shifts more to itself and thus constitutes the "inspection," checking, and removal of the disturbance. If heedful association
were simply a succession of "experiences" occurring "in time" · and if
these experiences "associated" with each other as intimately as possible, letting a conspicuous, unusable tool be encountered would be onto­
logically impossible. Whatever we have made accessible in contexts of
useful things, letting things be in relevance as such must be grounded in
the ecstatic unity of the making present that awaits and retains .
And how is it possible to "ascertain" that something is missing,
that is, unhandy, and not just at hand in an unhandy way? Unhandy
things are not discovered circumspectly in missing something. "Finding
out" that something is not objectively present is based upon missing
something, and both have their own existential presuppositions. Missing
something is by no means a not-making-present, but is a deficient mode
of the present in the sense of the not-making-present of something
expected or always already available. If circumspect letting things be
relevant were not awaiting what is taken care of "from the very begin­
ning," and if awaiting did not temporalize itself in the unity with a mak­
ing present, Da-sein could never "find out" that something is missing.
On the other hand, the possibility of being surprised lies in the fact
that the making present that awaits a thing does not await something else
that stands in a possible context of relevance with the former. The not

355

326

II. IV

Being and Time

awaiting of the making present that is lost first discloses the "horizonal"
realm in which something surprising can overcome Da-sein.

That with which heedful association fails to cope, either by pro­

ducing or procuring something, or even by turning away, keeping at a
dis tance, protecting oneself from something, is revealed in its insur-

356

mountability. Taking care accepts this. But accepting something is a

mode peculiar to circumspectly letting something be encountered. On

the basis of this discovery, taking care can fmd what is inconvenient, dis­
turbing, hindering, jeopardizing, or in general resistant in some way.

The temporal structure of accepting something lies in a

nonretention

that awaits and makes present. The making present that awaits does

not, for example, count "on" something that is unsuitable, but yet avail­
able. Not counting on . . . is a mode of taking into account what one

not

can­

hold on to. It is not forgotten, but retained so that it remains at

hand precisely

in its unsuitability.

Things at hand like this belong to the

everyday content of the factically disclosed surrounding world.

Only because things offering resistance are disclosed on the basis

of the ecstatic temporality of taking care, can factical Da-sein under­
stand itself in its abandonment to a "world" of which it never becomes

master. Even if taking care remains restricted to the urgency of everyday
needs, it is never a pure making present, but arises from a retention that
awaits; on the basis of such retention, or as such a "basis," Da-sein exists

in a world. For this reason factically existing Da-sein in a way always
already knows its way around, even in a strange "world."

When, in taking care of things, one lets something be in relevance,

one's doing so is grounded in temporality and amounts to an altogether
pre-ontological and unthematic way of understanding relevance and

things at hand. In what follows, we shall show how the understanding of
these determinations of being as such is in the end also founded in tem­

p orality. We must first demonstrate the temporality of being-in-the­

world still more concretely. With this as our aim, we shall trace how

the theoretical mode of behavior toward the "world" "arises" out of cir­
cumspect taking care of things at hand. The circumspect as well as the

theoretical discovery of innerworldly beings is based upon being-in-the­

world. The existential and temporal interpretation of these ways of dis­

covering will prepare the temporal characterization of this fundamental
constitution of Da-sein.

357

(b) The Temporal Meaning of the Way in which Circumspect Taking Care
Becomes Modified into the Theoretical Discovery of Things Objectively Present in
the World. When in the course of our existential and ontological analyses
we ask about how theoretical discovery "arises" from circumspect taking
care, this means that we are not making a problem out of the ontic his-

Being and Time

n.rv

327

tory an d developm ent of science, or of its factical occasions or of its
nearest goals. In searching for the ontological genesis of the theoretical
mo de of b ehavior, we are asking which of these conditions of possibility

in the constitution of being of Da-sein are existentially necessary for
Da-s ein to be able to exist in the mode of scientific investigation? This
question aims at an existential concept ofscience. This is distinct from the

"logical" concept that understands science with regard to its results and
defines it as a "context of causal relations of true, that is, valid proposi­
tions. " The existential concept understands science as a mode of exis­
tence and thus as a mode of being-in-the-world which discovers or dis­
closes beings or being. However, a completely adequate exis tential

meaning of being
and the "connection " between being and truth18 have been clarified in terms of

interpretation of science cannot be carried out until the

the temporality of existence. The following considerations are to prepare
the understanding of

this central problematic

within which the idea of

phenomenology can first be developed, as opposed to the pre-concep­
tion19 indicated in an introductory fashion.
In accordance with the stage of our study attained up to now, a fur­
ther restriction will be imposed upon our interpretation of the theoret­
ical mode of behavior. We are only inquiring into the way in which cir­
cu m s p e c t taking c a r e of things at hand changes over i n t o the
investigation of things obj ectively present found in the world, and we
shall be guided by the aim of penetrating to the temporal constitution of
being-in-the-world in general.
In characterizing the change-over from "practically" circumspect
handling and using and so on, to "theoretical" investigation, it would be
easy to suggest that merely looking at beings is something that emerges
when taking care

abstains

from any kind of use. Then what is decisive

about the "origin" of theoretical behavior would lie in the

disappearance of

praxis. So if one posits "practical" taking care as the primary and pre­
dominant kind of being of factical Da-sein, the ontological possibility of
"theory" will be due to the

absence

of praxis, that is, to a privation. But

stopping a specific kind of use in heedful association does not simply
leave its guiding circumspection behind as a remnant. Rather, taking
care then transposes itself explicitly into just-looking-around. But this is by
n o means the way in which the " theoretical" atti tude of s cience is
reached. On the contrary, the staying that stops which comes about when
use stops can acquire the quality of a more precise kind of circumspection, such as "inspecting, " checking what has been attained, as looking
over the "operations" just now "at a standstill . " To refrain from the use of
tools is so far from " theory" that staying, "reflecting" circumspection
remains completely stuck in the tools at hand taken care of. "Practical"
dealings have their own way of staying. And just as praxis has its own spe-

358

328

Being and Time

II.IV

cific sight ( " theory" ), theoretical investigation is not without its own
praxis. Reading off the measurements that result from an experiment
often requires a complicated "technological" set-up for the experimental
arrangement. Observing with the microscope is dependent upon the
production of "prepared slides." Archeological excavation that precedes
any interpretation of the "findings" demands the most massive manual
labor. But even the most "abstract" working out of problems and refin­
ing what has been gained, uses, for example, writing materials. As "unin­
teresting" and "obvious" as these components of scientific investigation
may be, they are by no means ontologically indifferent. The explicit ref­
erence to the fact that scientific behavior as a way of being-in-the-world
is not only a "purely intellectual activity" might seem unnecessarily com­
plicated and superfluous . If only it did not become clear from this trivi­
ality that it is by no means obvious where the ontological boundary
between " theoretical" and "atheoretical" behavior really lies!
One will want to assert that all manipulation in the sciences is only
in the service of pure observation, of the investigating discovery and
disclosure of the " things themselves. " Taken in its broadest sense, "see­
ing" regulates all "procedures" and retains its priority. "To whatever
kind of objects one's knowledge may relate itself and by whatever means
it may do so, still that through which it relates itself to them immediately,

and which all thinking as a means has as its goal [Heidegger's italics] is
intuition. "20 The idea of the intuitus has guided all interpretation of
knowledge ever since the beginnings of Greek ontology up to today,
whether that intuition is actually attainable or not. In accordance with
the priority of "seeing, " the demonstration of the existential genesis of
science will have to start out by characterizing the circumspection that
guides "practical" taking care of things.

359

Circumspection moves in the relevant relations of the context of
useful things at hand. It itself is again subject to the guidance of a more
or less explicit view over the totality of useful things in the actual world
of tools and the public surrounding world belonging to it. This overview
is not simply one that subsequently scrapes obj ectively present things
together. What is essential in the overview is the primary understanding
of the totality of relevance within which factical taking care always starts
out. The overview illumines taking care, and gets its "light" from the
potentiality-of-being of Da-sein for the sake

of which

taking care exists as

care. The circumspection of taking care that has this "overview" brings
things at hand

nearer to

Da-sein in its actual using and handling in the

mode of interpreting what it has seen. We call the specific bringing
near of what is taken care of by interpreting it circumspectly deliberation.
The schema peculiar to it is "if-then" : If this or that is to be produced,
put into use, or prevented, for example, then we need these or those

Being and Time

II. IV

329

mean s , ways, circumstances, or opportunities. Circumspect deliberation
throws light on the actual factical position of Da-sein in the surrounding

world taken care of. Thus it never simply "confirms" the obj ective pres­
ence of a being or of its qualities. Deliberation can also come about
without what is circumspectly approached itself being concretely at hand
or present within the nearest range. Bringing the surrounding world

near in circumspect deliberation has the existential meaning of making

present.

For representing is only a mode of making present. In it, delib­

eration catches sight directly of what is needed, but not at hand. Repre­
senting circumspection does not relate itself to "mere ideas . "
B u t circumspect making present is a phenomenon with more than
one kind of foundation. First of all, it belongs to the full ecstatic unity of

retention of the context of useful things
awaiting a possibility. What has already

been disclosed in awaiting retention is brought nearer by one's deliberative making present or representing. But if deliberation is to be able to
move in the scheme of "if-then," taking care must already understand a
context of relevance in an "overview." What is addressed with the "if'
must already be understood

as this and that.

For this, it is not necessary

that the understanding of useful things be expressed predicatively. The
scheme "something as something" is already prefigured in the structure of pre-predicative understanding. The as-structure is ontologically
grounded in the temporality of understanding. Only because Da-sein,
awaiting a possibility (that is, here a what-for), has come back to a for-this
( that is, retains a thing at hand}, can

conversely

the making present that

belongs to this awaiting retention start with this retention and

explicitly nearer

bring it

in its reference to the what-for. The deliberation that

brings near must in the scheme of making present adapt itself to the
kind of being of what is to be brought near. The character of relevance
of what is at hand is not first discovered by deliberation, but only gets
brought near by it in such a way that it circumspectly lets what is in rel­
evance be seen

as

this.

The way the present is rooted in the future and in the having-been
is the existential and temporal condition of the possibility that what is
projected in circumspect understanding can be brought nearer in a
making present in such a way that the present must adapt itself to what
is encountered in the horizon of awaiting retention, that is, it must
interpret itself in the schema of the as-structure. This gives us the answer
to our question whether the as-structure is existentially and ontologically

Like understanding and
interpretation in genera� the "as " is grounded in the ecstatic and horizontal

connection with the interpretation of the " i s " (which as a co pula

360

330

Being and Time

II.IV

"expresses" the addressing of something as something), we must again
make the as-phenomenon themati c and define the concept of the
"schema" existentially.
However, what is the temporal characterization of circumspect
deliberation and its schemata supposed to contribute to answering our
current question of the genesis of the theoretical mode of behavior?
Only enough to clarify the situation of Da-sein in which a circumspect
taking care changes over into theoretical discovery. We may then try
to analyze this change-over itself following the guideline of an elemental
s tatement of circumspect deliberation and its possible modifications .
In our circumspect use of tools, we can say that the hamm er is
too heavy or too light. Even the sentence that the hammer is heavy can
express a heedful deliberation, and mean that it is not light-that i t
requires force to u s e it o r it makes using i t difficult. B u t the statement

can also mean
36 1

that the being before us, with which we are circumspectly

familiar as a hamm e r, has a weight, that is, the "property" of heaviness.
It exerts a pressure on what lies beneath it, and when that is removed, it
falls. The discourse understood in this way is no longer in the horizon of
the awaiting retention of a totality of useful things and its relations of rel­
evance. What is said has been

drawn from

looking at what is appropriate

for a being with " mass." What is now in view is appropriate for the ham­
mer, not as a tool, but as a corporeal thing that is subj ect to the law of
gravity. Circumspect talk about being " too heavy" or "too light" no
longer has any "meaning"; that is, the being now encountered of its elf
provides us with nothing in relation to which it could be "found" too
heavy or too light.
Why does what we are talking about, the heavy hammer, show
itself differently when our way of talking is modified? Not because we
are keeping our distance from handling, nor because we are only look­

away from the useful character of this being, but because we are
at the thing at hand encountered in a "new" way, as something
objectively present. The understanding of being guiding the heedful asso­
ciation with innerworldly b eings has been transformed. But does this

ing

looking

already constitute a scientific mode of behavior if we "comprehend"
things at hand as something objectively present, instead of circumspectly
deliberating about them? Moreover, even things at hand can be made a
theme of scientific investigation and determination, for example, in
examining someone's surrounding world, his milieu in the context of a
historiographical biography. The everyday context of useful things at
hand, their historical origination and utilization, their factical role in
Da-sein-all these are the objects of the science of economics. Things at
hand need not lose their character of being useful things in order to
become the "obj ect" of a science. A modification of our understanding

Being and Time

II . IV

33 1

of being s eems not to be necessarily constitutive for the genesis of the
theoretical mode of behavior "toward things." Certainly not, if this mod­
ification is supposed to mean a change of the kind of being which, in
understanding the being in question, we understand it to possess.
In our first characterization of the genesis of the theoretical mode
of behavior from circumspection, we have made basic a kind of theoretical grasping of innerworldly beings, of physical nature, in which the
modification of our understanding of being amounts to a transformation. In the "physical" statement that "the hammer is heavy, " we

overlook

not only the tool-character of the being encountered, but thus also that
which belongs to every useful thing at han d : its plac e . The place
becomes indifferent. This does not mean that the objectively present
thing loses its "location" altogether. Its place becomes a position in
space and time, a "world point," which is in no way distinguished from
any other. This means that the multiplicity of places of useful things at
hand defined in the surrounding world is not just modified to a sheer
multiplicity of positions, but the beings of the surrounding world are

released. The

totality of what is obj ectively present becomes thematic.

In this case, a releasing of the surrounding world belongs to the
modification of the understanding of being. Following the guideline of
the unders tanding o f being in the sense of objective presence, this
release becomes at the same time a delimitation of the "region" of what
is objectively present. The more appropriately the being of the beings to
be investigated is understood in the guiding understanding of being
and the more the totality of beings is articulated in its fundamental
determinations as a possible area of subject-matter for a science, the
more assured will be the actual p erspective of methodical questioning.
The classic example for the historical development of a science,
and even for i ts ontologi c al genesis, is the origin of mathematical
physics. What is decisive for its development lies neither in its higher
evaluation of the observation of "facts," nor in the "application" of math­
ematics in determining events of nature, but the

nature itself.

mathematical project of

This proj e c t discovers in advance something constantly

objectively present (matter) and opens the horizon for the guiding per­
spective on its quantitatively definable constitutive moments (motion,
force, location, and time). Only

"in the light of' a nature thus proj ected

can something like a "fact" be found and be taken in as a point of depar­
ture for an experiment defined and regulated in terms of this project.
The " founding" of "factual science" was possible only becau s e the
researchers understood that there are in principle no "bare facts." What
is decisive about the mathematical project of nature is again not pri­
marily the mathematical element as such, but the fact that this project

discloses a priori. And thus the paradigm of the mathematical natural sci-

362

332

II. IV

Being and Time

ences does not consist in its specific exactitude and binding character for
"everyone," but in the fact that in it the thematic beings are discovered
in

the only way that beings

can be discovered: in the prior project of their

constitution of being. When the basic concepts of the understanding of
being by which we are guided have been worked out, the methods, the

363

structure of conceptuality, the relevant possibility of truth and certainty,
the kind of grounding and proof, the mode of being binding and the
kind of communication-all these will be determined. The totality of
these moments constitutes the complete existential concept of science.
The s cientific proj e c t of the beings s omehow always already
encountered lets their kind of being be explicitly understood in such a
way that the possible ways of purely discovering innerworldly b eings
thus become evident. The articulation of the understanding of being, the
definition of the subject-matter defined by that understanding, and the
prefiguration of the concepts suitable to these beings, all belong to the
totality of this projecting that we call

thematization.

It aims at freeing

beings encountered within the world in such a way that they can "pro­
j ect" themselves back upon pure discovery, that is, they can become
objects. Thematization obj ectifies. It does not first "posit" beings, but
frees them in such a way that they become "obj ectively" subject to ques­
tioning and definition. The objectifying being together with innerworldly
things objectively present has the character of an

sent.22

eminent making pre·

It is above all distinguished from the present of circumspection by

the fact that the discovering of the science in question solely awaits the
discoveredness of what is objectively present. This awaiting of discov­
eredness is grounded existentielly in a resoluteness of Da-sein by means
of which it proj ects itself upon its p otentiality-of-being-in-the-"truth . "
This proj ect i s possible because being-in-the-truth constitutes a deter­
mination of the existence of Da-sein. How science has its origin in
authentic existence is not to be pursued here. It is simply a matter of
understanding that and how the thematization of innerworldly beings
presupposes being-in-the-world as the fundamental constitution of Da­
sein.
If the thematization of what is objectively present-the scientific
proj ect of nature-is to become possible, Da-sein must transcend the beings
thematized. Transcendence does not consist in objectivation, but is

364

rather presupposed by it. But if the thematization of innerworldly beings
objectively present is a change-over from taking care which circum­
spectly discovers, then a transcendence of Da-sein must already underlie
" practical" being together with things at hand.
Furthermore, if thematization modifies and articulates the under­
standing of being, insofar as Da-sein, the being that thematizes, exists, it
must already understand something like being. This understanding of

II. IV

Being and Time

333

being can remain neutral. Then handiness and objective presence are
not differentiated, still less are they conceived ontologically. But for Da­
sein to be able to have something to do with a context of useful things,
it must understand something like relevance, even if only unthematically.
A world must be disclosed to it. The world is disclosed with the factical
existence of Da-sein, if indeed Da-sein essentially exists as being-in-the­
world. And if the being of Da-sein is completely grounded in temporal­
i ty, temporality must make possible being-in-the-world and thus the tran­
scendence of Da-sein, which in its tum supports the being together with
innerworldly beings that takes care, whether theoretical or practical.

(c) The Temporal Problem of the Transcendence of the World. The under­
standing of a totality of relevance inherent in circumspect taking care is
grounded in a previous understanding of the relations of in-order-to,
what-for, for-that, and for-the-sake-of-which. We set forth the connec­
tion of these relations as significance.2� Their unity constitutes what we
call world. Now the question arises of how something like world in its
unity with Da-sein is ontologically possible? In what way must world be
for Da-sein to be able to exist as being-in-the-world?
Da-sein exists for the sake of a potentiality-of-being of itself. Exist­
ing, it is thrown, and as thrown, delivered over to beings that it needs in
order to be able to be as it is, namely for the sake of itself. Since Da-sein
exists factically, it understands itself in this connection of the for-the­
sake-of-itself with an actual in-order-to. That within which existing Da­
sein understands itself is "there" together with its factical existence. The
wherein of primary self-understanding has the kind of being of Da-sein.
Existing, Da-sein is its world.
We defined the being of Da-sein as care. Its ontological meaning is
temporality: We showed that and how temporality constitutes the dis­
closedness of the there. World is also disclosed in the disclosedness of
the There. The unity of significance, that is, the ontological constitution
of the world, must then also be grounded in temporality. The existential
and temporal condition of the possibility of the world lies in the fact that tem­
porality, as an ecstatical unity, has something like a horizon. The ecstasies are
not simply raptures toward . . . . Rather, a "whereto" of raptness belongs
to each ecstasy. We call this whereto of the ecstasy the horizonal schema.
The ecstatical horizon is different in each of the three ecstasies. The
schema in which Da-sein comes back to itselfjuturally whether authentically or inauthentically , is the for-the-sake-of-itself. We call the schema in
which Da-sein is disclosed to itself in attunement as thrown, that in the
face of which it has been thrown and that to which it has been delivered
over. It characterizes the horizonal structure of the having-been. Existing
for the sake of itself in being delivered over to itself as thrown, Da-sein is
,

365

334

Being and Time

at the same time making present as being together with . . . . The hori­
zonal schema of the present is determined by the

in-order-to.

The unity of the horizonal schemata of future, having-been, and
present is grounded in the ecstatic unity of temporality. The horizon of
the whole of temporality determines
ing is essentially

disclosed.

whereupon the being factically exist­

With factical Da-sein, a potentiality-of-being is

always projected in the horizon of the future, "already being" is dis­
closed in the horizon of the having-been, and what is taken care of is dis­
c overed in the horizon of the present. The horizonal unity of the
schemata of the ecstasies makes possible the primordial connection of
the relations of the in-order-to with the for-the-sake-of-which. This means
that on the basis of the horizonal constitution of the ecstatic unity of
temporality, something like a disclosed world belongs to the being that
is always its There.
Just as the present arises in the unity of the temporalizing of tem­
porality from the future and the having-been, the horizon of a present
temporalizes itself equiprimordially with those of the future and the
having-been. Insofar as Da-sein temporalizes itself, a world

is,

too . Tem­

poralizing itself with regard to its being as temporality, Da-sein

is essen­

tially "in a world" on the basis of the ecstatic and horizontal constitution
of that temporality. The world is neither objectively present nor at hand,
but temporalizes itself in temporality. It "is" " there" together with the
outside-itself of the ecstasies. If no Da-sein exists, no world is " there"
either.

The world is already presupposed in one's being together with

things

at hand heedfully and factically , in one's thematization of what is objec­
tively present, and in one's objectivating discovery of the latter, that is, all

366

these are possible only as modes of being-in-the-world. The world is
transcendent, grounded in the horizonal unity of ecstatic temporality. It
must already be ecstatically disclosed so that innerworldly beings can be
encountered from it. Temporality already holds itself ecstatically in the
horizons of its ecs tasies and, temporalizing itself, comes back to the
beings encountered in the There. With the factical existence of Da-sein,
innerworldly beings are also already encountered. That such beings are
discovered in the There of its own existence is not under the control of
Da-sein. Only

what,

in

which

direction,

to what extent, and how

it actually

discovers and discloses is a matter of freedom, although always within
the limits of its thrownness.
The relations of significance that determine the structure of the
world are thus not a network of forms that is imposed upon some mate­
rial by a worldless subject. Rather, factical Da-sein, ecstatically under­
standing itself and its world in the unity of the There, comes back from
these horizons to the beings encountered in them. Coming back to

II. IV

Being and Time

335

these beings unders tandingly is the existential meaning of letting them
be encountered in making them present; for this reason they are call e d
innerworld.ly. The world is, so to speak, already "further outside" than
any object could ever be. The "problem of transcendence" cannot be
reduced to the question of how does a subject get outside to an object,
whereby the totality of objects is identified with the idea of the world.
We must rather ask what makes it ontologically possible for beings to be
encountered within the world and objectified as encountered beings?
Going back to the ecstatically and horizonally founding trans cendence of
the world will give us the answer.
If the "subject" is conceived ontologically as existing Da-sein, whose
being is grounded in temporality, we must say then that the world is
"subjective. " But this "subjective" world, as one that is temporally tran­
scendent, is then "more objective" than any possible "object."
By tracing being-in-the-world back to the ecstatic and horizonal
unity of temporality, we have made the existential and ontological pos­
sibility of this fundamental constitution of Da-sein intelligible. At the
same time it becomes clear that the concrete development of the struc­
ture of world in general and of its possible variations can be attempted
only if an ontology of possible innerworld.ly beings is oriented toward a
clarified idea of being in general with sufficient assurance. The possible
interpretation of this idea requires that we set forth the temporality of
Da-sein beforehand; here our characterization of being-in-the-world will
be of service.

70. The Temporality of the Spatiality Characteristic of Da-sein
Although the expression " temporality" does not mean what the talk
about "space and time" understands by time, spatiality seems to consti­
tute another basic attribute of Da-sein corresponding to temporality.
The existential and temporal analysis thus appears to reach a limit with
the spatiality of Da-sein, so that this being that we call Da-sein must be
addressed coordinately as "temporal" "and also" as spatial. Does the
existential and temporal analysis of Da-sein come to a halt on account of
the phenomenon that we got to know as the spatiality of Da-sein and
that we showed to belong to being-in-the-world?24
If in the course of our existential interpretation we were to talk
about the " spatio-temporal" determination of Da-sein, we could not
mean that this being is objectively present "in space and also in time" ;
this needs no further discussion. Temporality i s the meaning o f being o f
care. The constitution of Da-sein and its modes of being are ontologi­
cally possible only on the basis of temporality, regardless whether this
being occurs "in time" or not. But then the specific spatiality of Da-sein

367

Being and Time

336

II.JV

must be grounded in temporality. On the other hand, the demonstration
that this spatiality is existentially possible only through temporality, can­
not aim either at deducing space from time or at dissolving it into pure
time. If the spatiality of Da-sein is " embraced" by temporality in the
s ense of an existential foundation, this connection (which is to be clari­
fied in what follows) is also different from the priority of time over
space in Kant's sens e . That the empirical representations of what is
obj ectively present "in space" occur as psychical events "in time, " so
that the "physical" also occurs indirectly "in time," is not to give an exis­
tential and ontological interpretation of space as a form of sensibility,
but rather to as certain ontically that what is psychically obj ectively pre­
sent runs its course "in time."
We shall ask existentially and analytically about the temporal con­
ditions of the possibility of the spatiality of Da-sein-the spatiality that in
turn founds the discovering of space within the world. Before that we
mus t remember in what way Da-sein is spatial. Da-sein can

be

spatial

only as care, in the sense of factically entangled existing. Negatively this

368

means that Da-sein is never obj ectively present in space, not even ini­
tially. Da-sein does not fill out a piece of space as a real thing or useful
thing would do, so that the boundaries dividing it from the surrounding
space would themselves just define that space spatially. In the literal
sense, Da-sein takes space in. It is by no means merely objectively present
in the piece of space that its body fills out. Existing, it has always already
made room for a leeway. It determines its own location in such a way
that it comes back from the space made room for to a "place" that it has
taken over. To be able to say that Da-sein is objectively present at a posi­
tion in space, we have to

grasp

this being beforehand in an ontologi­

cally inappropriate way. Nor does the difference between the "spatiality"
of an extended thing and that of Da-sein lie in the fact that Da-sein

knows

about space. Making room is so far from identical with the "rep­

resentation" of something spatial that the latter presupposes the for­
mer. Nor may the spatiality of Da-sein be interpreted as a kind of imper­
fection that adheres to exis tence on account of the fatal "connection of
the spirit with a body. " Rather, because Da-sein is "spiritual,"

because it is spiritua l,

and on ly

it can be spatial in a way that essentially remains

impossible for an extended corporeal thing.
The making room of Da-sein is constituted by directionality and
de-distancing. How is something like this existentially possible on the
basis of the temporality of Da-sein? The foundational function of tem­
porality for the spatiality of Da-sein is to be indicated briefly only to
the extent that it is necessary for later discussions of the ontological
meaning of the "coupling" of space and time. The directional discovery
of something like a

region belongs

to the making room of Da-sein. With

Being and Time

this expression we mean initially the whereto of the possible belonging
somewhere of useful things at hand in the surrounding world. Whenever
one comes across useful things, handles them, moves them around, or
out of the way, a region has already been discovered. Being-in-the-world
that takes care of things is directed, directing itself. Belonging-some­
where has an essential relation to relevance. It is always factically deter­
mined in terms of the context of relevance of the useful things taken
care of. The relevant relations are intelligible only in the horizon of a dis­
closed world. Their horizonal nature also first makes possible the spe­
cific horizon of the whereto of regional belonging. The self-directive
discovering of a region is grounded in an ecstatically retentive awaiting
of the possible hither and whither. As a directed awaiting of region,
making room is equiprimordially a bringing-near ( or de-distancing) of
things at hand and obj ectively present. De-distancing, taking care comes
back out of the previously discovered region to what is nearest. Bringingnear and the estimating and measurement of distances within what is
objectively present within the de-dis tanced world are grounded in a
making-present that belongs to the unity of temporality in which direc­
tionality is possible, too.
Because Da-sein as temporality is ecstatic and horizonal in i ts
being, it can factically and constantly take along space for which it has
made room. With regard to this space ecstatically made room for, the
here of its actual factical location or situation never signifies a position in
space, but the leeway of the range of the totality of useful things taken
care of nearby-a leeway that has been opened in directionality and de­
distancing.

In bringing-dose that makes possible the handling and being occu­
pied that is "absorbed in the matter, " the essential structure of care­
falling prey-makes itself known. Its existential and temporal constitution
is distinguished by the fact that in falling prey, and thus also in the
bringing near which is founded in "making present, " the forgetting that
awaits pursues the present. In the making present that brings some­
thing near from its wherefrom, making present loses itself in itself, and
forgets the over there. For this reason if the " observation" of inner­
worldly beings starts in such a making present, the illusion arises that
"ini tially " only a thing is obj ectively present, here indeed, but indeter­
minately, in a space in general.

Only on the basis of ecstatic and horizonal temporality is it possible for Da·
sein to break into space. The world is not obj ectively present in space;
however, only within a world can space be discovered. The ecstatic tem­
p orality of the spatiality of Da-sein makes it intelligible that space is
independent of time, but on the other hand this same temporality makes
intelligible also the "dependency" of Da-sein upon space-a dependence

369

II.IV

Being and Time

338

that makes itself manifest in the familiar phenomenon that both the
self-interpretation of Da-sein and the content of significance of language
are to a large extent dominated by "spatial representations " in general.
This priority of the spatial in the articulation of significations and con­
cepts has its ground, not in some specific power of space, but rather in
the kind of being of Da-sein. * Essentially entangled, temporality loses
itself in making present, and understands itself not only circumspectly in
terms of the things at hand taken care of, but from those spatial relations
that making present constantly meets up with in what is at hand as pre­
sent, it takes its guidelines for articulating what is understood and can be
interpreted in understanding in general.

71. The Temporal Meaning of the Everydayness of Da-sein
The analysis of the temporality of taking care showed that the essential
structures of the constitution of being of Da-sein that were interpreted

before setting forth temporality, with the intention of arriving at tempo­
rality, must themselves be taken back existentially into temporality. At the
very beginning of our analysis we did not choose a definite, eminent pos­
sibility-of-exis tence of Da-sein as our theme, but our analytic was ori­
ented toward the inconspicuous, average modes of existing. We called
the kind of being in which Da-sein holds its elf initially and for the most
part everydayness . 25
What this expression signifies basically when ontologically defined
remains obscure . At the beginning of our inquiry there was no way
available of even making the existential and ontological meaning of
everydayness a problem. But now the meaning of being of Da-sein has
been illuminated as temporality. Can there still be any doubt with regard
to the existential and temporal significance of the term "everydayness"?
Ye t we are far removed from an ontological concept of this phe­
nomenon. It even remains questionable whether the explication of tem­
porality carried out up to now is adequate to explain the existential
meaning of everydayness.
Everydayness evidently means

the mode

of existing in which Da­

s ein holds i tself " each day." And yet " each day" does not signify the
sum of the "days" that are allotted to Da-sein in its "lifetime. " Although
" each day" is not to be understood in the sense of the calendar, yet
some such temporal determination still echoes in the significance of
the "everyday." But the expression "everydayness" primarily signifies a
certain

How

of existence that prevails in Da-sein "as long as it lives. " In

our earlier analyses we often used the expression "initially and for the

Being and Time

mo s t p art." "Initially" means the way in which Da-sein is "manifest" in
th e bein g-with-one-another of publicness, even if it has "basically" pre­
cis ely "overcome" everydayness existentielly. "For the most part" signi­

"
fies the way in which Da-sein shows itself for everyone as a rule," but
not always .

Everydayness means the How in accordance with which Da-sein

"lives its day," whether in all of its modes of behavior or only in certain
ways prefigured by being-with-one-another. Furthermore, being comfortable in habit belongs to this How, even if habit forces us to what is
burdensome and "repulsive. " The tomorrow that everyday taking care
waits for is the "eternal yesterday." The monotony of everydayness takes
whatever the day happens to bring as a change. Everydayness determines Da-sein even when it has not chosen the they as its "hero . "
B u t these manifold qualities o f everydayness b y no means charac­
terize it as the mere "aspect" that Da-sein proffers when "one" "looks at"
the things human beings do. Everydayness is a way

to be

-

to which, of

course, public manifestness belongs . But as a way of its own existing,
everydayness is more or less familiar to actual "individual" Da-sein,
indeed, through the attunement of the pallid lack of mood. Da-sein can
"suffer" dully from everydayness, sink into its dullness, and evade it by
looking for new ways in which its dispersion in its affairs may be further
dispersed. But existence can also master the everyday in the Moment,
often only "for the moment, " but it can never extinguish it.
What is

ontically

so familiar in the factical interpretedness of Da­

sein that we don't even pay any attention to it, contains enigma upon
enigma existentially and ontologically. The "natural" horizon for starting
the existential analytic of Da-sein is

only seemingly obvious.

But, after our earlier interpretation of temporality, are we in a
more fruitful position with regard to the existential delimitation of the
structure of everydayness? Or does this confusing phenomenon pre­
cisely make evident what is insufficient about our explication of tempo­
rality up to now? Have we not been constantly immobilizing Da-sein in
certain positions and situations, while " consistently" disregarding the
fact that, in living into its days, it

stretches

itself

along

" temporally" in

the succession of its days? The monotony, the habit, the "like yester­
day, so today and tomorrow, " and the "for the most part" cannot be
grasped without recourse to the " temporal" stretching along of Da-sein.
And is it not also a fact of existing Da-sein that, passing its time, it
takes " time" daily into account and regulates the "calculation" astro­
nomically and with the calendar? Only if we bring the everyday "occur­
rence" of Da-sein and the heedful calculation of " time" in this occur­
rence into the interpretation of the temporality of Da-sein, will our
orientation become comprehensive enough to enable us to make the

371

340

II.IV

Being and Time

ontolo gi cal meaning of everydayness as such problematic. However,

372

since basically nothing other is meant by the term everydayness than
temporality, and since temporality makes the

being of Da-sein

possible,

an adequate conceptual delineation of everydayness can succeed only in
the framework of a fundamental discussion of the meaning of being in
general and its possible variations.

v

Temporality and Historicity

72. Existential and Ontological Exposition of the Problem of History
All our efforts in the existential analytic are geared to the one goal of
finding a possibility of answering the question of the meaning of being in
general. The development of this

question requires

that we delineate the

phenomenon in which something like being itself becomes accessible­
the phenomenon of the

understanding of being.

But this phenomenon

belongs to the constitution of being of Da-sein. Only when this being has
been interpreted beforehand in a sufficiently primordial way, can the
understanding of being contained in its constitution of being itself be
grasp ed, and only on that basis can we formulate the question of being
understood in this understanding and the question of what such under­
standing "presupposes."
Although many structures of Da-sein still remain in the dark with
regard to particulars, yet it seems that we have reached the requisite, pri­
mordial interpretation of Da-sein with the clarification of temporality as the
primordial condition of the possibility of care. Temporality was set forth
with regard to the authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole of Da-sein. The
temporal interpretation of care was then confirmed by demonstrating the

temporality of heedful being-in-the-world. Our analysis of the authentic
potentiality-of-being-a-whole revealed that an equiprimordial connection of
death, guilt, and conscience is rooted in care. Can Da-sein be understood
s till more primordially than in the project of its authentic existence?
Although up to now we have not seen any possibility of a more

radical starting point for our existential analytic, yet with regard to the

341

Being and Time

342

II.v

above discussion of the ontological meaning of everydayness, a serious
reservation comes to light: Has indeed the whole of Da-sein with respect
to its authentic

being a whole
-

-

been captured in the fore-having of our

existential analysis? It may be that the line of questioning related to the
wholeness of Da-sein possesses a genuinely unequivocal character onto-

373

logically. The question itself may even have been answered with regard
to

being-toward-the-end.

However, death is, after all, only the "end" of Da­

sein, and formally speaking, it is just

one of the

ends that embraces the

totality of Da-sein. But the other "end" is the "beginning," "birth." Only
the being "between" birth and death presents the whole we are looking
for. Then the previous orientation of our analytic would remain " one­
sided, " in spite of all its tendencies toward a consideration of

existing

being-a-whole and in spite of the genuineness with which authentic and
inauthentic being-toward-death have been explicated. Da-sein has been
our theme only as to how it exists, so to speak, "forward" and leaves
everything that has been "behind. " Not only did being-toward-the-begin­
ning remain unnoticed, but, above all, the way Da-sein

between

stretches along

birth and death. Precisely the "connection of life , " in which,

after all, Da-sein constantly somehow holds itself, was overlooked in
our analysis of being-a-whole.
Must we not then take back our point of departure of temporality
as the meaning of being of the totality of Da-sein, even though what we
addressed as the "connection" between birth and death is ontologically
completely obscure? Or does

foundation

temporality,

as we set it forth, first give the

on which to provide an unequivocal direction for the exis­

tential and ontological question of that " connection"? Perhaps it is
already a gain in the field of this inquiry if we learn not to take the
problems too lightly.
What seems "more simple" than the nature of the "connection of
life" between birth and death? It

consists

of a succession of experiences

"in time . " If we pursue this characterization of the connection in ques­
tion and above all of the ontological assumption behind it in a more pen­
etrating way, something remarkable happens. In this succession of expe­
riences only the experience that is obj ectively present "in the actual
now" is "really" "real . " The experiences past and just coming, on the
other hand, are no longer or not yet "real . " Da-sein traverses the time­
span allotted to it between the two boundaries in such a way that it is
"real" only in the now and hops, so to speak, through the succession of
nows of its " time." For this reason one says that Da-sein is "temporal."
The self maintains itself in a certain sameness throughout this constant
change of experiences . Opinions diverge as to how this persistent self is
to be defined and how one is to determine what relation it may possibly
have to the changing experiences. The being of this persistingly chang-

II.v

Being and Time

343

ing connection of experiences remains undetermined. But basically
something objectively present "in time," but of course "unthinglike,"
has been posited in this characterization of the connection of life,
whether one admits it or not.
With regard to what was developed as the meaning of being of
care under the rubric of temporality, we found that while following the
guideline of the vulgar interpretation of Da-sein, within its own limits, is
justified and adequate, we could not carry through a genuine ontological analysis of the way Da-sein stretches along between birth and death if
we take this interpretation as our guideline, nor could we even establish
such an analysis as a problem.
Da-sein does not exist as the sum of the momentary realities of
experiences that succeed each other and disappear. Nor does this suc­
cession gradually fill up a framework. For how should that framework be
objectively present, when it is always only the experience that one is hav­
ing "right now" that is "real," and when the boundaries of the frame­
work-birth that is past and death that is yet to come-are lacking reality.
At bottom, even the vulgar interpretation of the "connectedness of life"
does not think of a framework spanned "outside" of Da-sein and embrac­
ing it, but correctly looks for it in Da-sein itself. When, however, one tac­
idy regards this being ontologically as something objectively present "in
time," an attempt at any ontological characterization of the being
"between" birth and death gets stranded.
Da-sein does not first fill up an objectively present path or stretch
"of life" through the phases of its momentary realities, but stretches
itself along in such a way that its own being is constituted beforehand as
this stretching along. The "between" of birth and death already lies in the
being of Da-sein. On the other hand, it is by no means the case that Da­
sein is real in a point of time, and that, in addition, it is then "sur­
rounded" by the nonreality of its birth and its death. Understood exis­
tentially, birth is never something past in the sense of what is no longer
objectively present, and death is just as far from having the kind of
being of something outstanding that is not yet objectively present but
will come. Factical Da-sein exists as born, and, born, it is already dying in
the sense of being-toward-death. Both "ends" and their "between" are as
long as Da-sein factically exists, and they are in the sole way possible on
the basis of the being of Da-sein as care. In the unity of thrownness and
the fleeting or else anticipatory being-toward-death, birth and death
"are connected" in the way appropriate to Da-sein. As care, Da-sein is the
"B etween."
But the constitutional totality of care has the possible ground of its
unity in temporality. The ontological clarification of the "connected­
ness of life," that is, of the specific way of stretching along, movement,

374

344

II.v

Being and Time

and persistence of Da-sein, must accordingly be approached in the hori-

375

zon of the temporal constitution of this being. The movement of exis­
tence is not the motion of something objectively present. It is deter­
mined from the stretching along of Da-sein. The specific movement of
the

stretched out stretching itself along,

we call the

occurrence

of Da-sein.

The question of the "connectedness" of Da-sein is the ontological prob­
lem of its occurrence. To expose the structure

of occurrence and

the exis­

tential and temporal conditions of its possibility means to gain an

onto­

logical understanding of historicity.
With the analysis of the specific movement and persistence appro­
priate to the occurrence of Da-sein, our inquiry returns to the problem
that was touched upon right before the exposition of temporality: to the
question of the constancy of the self that we determined as the who of
D a-sein . 1 Self-cons tancy is a mode o f being of Da-s ein and is thus
grounded in a specific temporalizing of temporality. The analysis of
o ccurrence introduces the problems found in a thematic investigation
into temporalization as such.
If the question of historicity leads back to those "origins," the place
of the problem of history has thus already been decided upon. We must
not search in historiography as the science of history. Even if the scientific
and theoretical kind of treaunent of the problem of "history" does not
just aim at an "epistemological" (Simmel) clarification of historiographi­
cal comprehension, or at the logic of the concept formation of historio­
graphical presentation (Rickert}, but is rather oriented toward the "objec­
tive side, " history is accessible in this line of questioning only as the

object

of a science. The basic phenomenon of history, which is prior to the
possibility of making something thematic by historiography and underlies
it, is thus irrevocably set aside. How history can become a possible

object

for historiography, can be gathered only from the kind of being of what
is historical, from historicity and its rootedness in temporality.
If historicity itself is to be illuminated in terms of temporality, and
primordially in terms of authentic temporality, then it is essential to this
task that it can only be carried out by way of a phenomenological con-

376

struction. *2 The existential and ontological constitution of historicity
must be mastered in

opposition to the vulgar interpretation of the history

of Da-sein that covers over. The existential construction of historicity has
its definite support in the vulgar understanding of Da-sein and is guided
by those existential structures attained so far.
We shall first describe the vulgar concept of history, so that we may
give our investigation an orientation as to the factors which are generally

Being and Time

II.v

345

held to be essential for history. Here it must become clear what is pri­
mordially considered as historical. Thus the point of departure for the
exposition of the ontological problem of historicity has been designated.
Our interpretation of the authentic potentiality-of-being-a-whole
of Da-sein and our analysis of care as temporality arising from that inter­
pretation, offer the guideline for the existential construction of his­
toricity. The existential proj ect for the historicity of Da-sein only reveals
what already lies enveloped in the temporalizing of temporality. Corre­
sponding to the rootedness of historicity in care, Da-sein always exists as
authentically or inauthentically historical. What we had in view under the
rubric of everydayness for the existential analytic of Da-sein as the near­
est horizon gets clarified as the inauthentic historicity of Da-sein.
Disclosure and interpretation belong essentially to the occurrence
of Da-sein. From the kind of being of this being that exists historically,
there arises the existentiell possibility of an explicit disclosure and grasp
of history. Making it thematic, that is, the

historiographical disclosure

of

history, is the presupposition for the possibility of "building up the his­
torical world in the sciences of the humanities . " The existential inter­
pretation of historiography as a science aims solely at a demonstration of
its ontological provenance from the historicity of Da-sein. Only from
here are the boundaries to be staked out within which a theory of sci­
ence oriented toward the factical business of science may expose itself to
the chance elements of its line of questioning.

The analysis of the historicity of Da-sein attempted to show that this being
is not "tempora� " because it "is in history, " but because, on the contrary, it exists
and can exist historically only because it is temporal in the ground of its being.
Nevertheless, Da-sein must also be called "temporal" in the sense
of its being "in time. " Factical Da-sein needs and uses the calendar and
the clock even without a developed historiography. What occurs "with
it, " it experiences as occurring "in time." In the same way, the processes
of nature, whether living or lifeless, are encountered "in time. " They are
within-time. So while our analysis of how the "time" of within-time-ness

has its s ource in temporality will be deferred until the next chapter,' it
would be easy to put this before the discussion of the connection
between historicity and temporality. What is historical is ordinarily char­
acterized with the aid of the time of within-time-ness. But if this vulgar
characterization is to be stripped of its seeming self-evidence and exclu­
siveness, historicity is to be "deduced" beforehand purely from the pri­
mordial temporality of Da-sein. This is required by the way these are
" objectively" connected. But since time as within-time-ness also "stems"
from the temporality of Da-sein, historicity and within-time-ness tum
out to be equiprimordial. The vulgar interpretation of the temporal
character of history is thus justified within its limits.

377

346

Being and Time

Il.v

After this first characterization of the course of the ontological
exposition of historicity in terms of temporality, do we still need explicit
assurance that the following inquiry does not believe that the problem of
history can be solved by a sleight of hand? The paucity of the available
"categorial" means and the uncertainty of the primary ontological hori­
zons become all the more obtrusive, the more the problem of history is
traced to its

primordial rootedness .

In the following reflections, we shall

content ourselves with indicating the ontological place of the problem of
historicity. Basically, the following analysis is solely concerned with fur­
thering the investigations of Dilthey in a preparatory way. Today's pre­
sent generation has not as yet made them its own.
Our exposition of the existential problem of historicity-an expo­
sition, moreover, that is of necessity limited by our fundamental and
ontological aim-is divided up as follows: the vulgar understanding of
history and the occurrence of Da-sein (section
constitution of historicity (section
world history (section

73); the fundamental
74); the historicity of Da-sein and

75); the existential origin of historiography from
76); the connection of the previous

the historicity of Da-sein (section

exposition of the problem of historicity with the investigations of Dilthey
and the ideas of Count Yorck (section

378

77).

73. The Vulgar Understanding of History and the Occurrence of Da-sein
Our next goal is to find the point of departure for the primordial ques­
tion of the essence of history, that is, for the existential construction of
historicity. This point is designated by what is primarily historical. Thus
our reflections begin with a characterization of what is meant by the
expressions "history" and "historical" in the vulgar interpretation of Da­
sein. They are ambiguous.
The most obvious ambiguity of the term "history" has often been
noted, and it is by no means "approximate." It makes itself known in the
fact that it means "historical reality" as well as the possibility of a science
of it. For the time being, we shall leave out the signification of "history"
in the sense of a s cience of history (historiography}.
Among the meanings of the expression "history" that signify nei­
ther the science of history nor the latter as an object, but rather this
being itself which has not necessarily been objectified, the one in which
this being is understood as something past claims a preferred use. This
significance makes itself known in talk such as "this or that already
b elongs to history." Here "pas t" means on the one hand "no longer
obj ectively present," or else "indeed still obj ectively present, but without
' effect' on the 'present' . " However, what is historical as what is past also
has the opposite significance when we say that one cannot evade history.

II.v

Being and Time

347

Here history means what is past, * but is nevertheless still having an effect.
However, what is historical as what is past is understood in a positive or
privative effective relation to the "present" in the sense of what is real
"now" and "today." "The past" has a remarkable ambiguity here. Here
"the past" belongs irrevocably to an earlier time; it belonged to former
events and can yet still be objectively present "now"-for example, the
remains of a Greek temple. A "bit of the past" is still "present" in it.
Thus history does not so much mean the "past" in the sense of
what is past, but the derivation from it. Whatever "has a history" is in the
context of a becoming. Here the " development" is sometimes a rise,
sometimes a fall. Whatever "has a history" in this way can at the same
time "make" history. " Epoch making, " it "presently" determines a
" fu ture." Here history means a "connection" of events and "effects"
that moves through the "past," the "present" and the "future." Here
the past has no particular priority.
Furthermore, history signifies the whole of beings that change "in
time," the transformations and destinies of humankind, human institu­
tions and their "cultures, " in contradistinction to nature that similarly
moves "in time. " History means here not so much the kind of being, the
occurrence, as the region of beings that one distinguishes from nature
with regard to the essential determination of the existence of human
being as "spirit" and " culture," although nature, too, belongs in a way to
history thus understood.
And finally, what has been handed down as such is taken to be
"historical, " whether it be known historiographically or taken over as
being self-evident and concealed in its derivation.
If we consider the four meanings together, we find that history is
the specific occurrence of existing Da-sein happening in time, in such a
way that the occurrence in being-with-one-another that is "past" and at
the same time "handed down" and still having its effect is taken to be his­
tory in the sense emphasized.
The four meanings have a connection in that they are related to
human being as the "subject" of events. How is the kind of occurrence of
these events to be determined? Is the occurrence a succession of pro­
cesses, a changing appearance and disappearance of events? In what
way does this occurrence of history belong to Da-sein? Is Da-sein facti­
cally already "objectively present" beforehand, and then at times gets
into "a history"? Does Da-sein first

become

historical through a concate­

nation of circumstances and events? Or is the being of Da-sein first con­
stituted by occurrence, so that

*

379

348

Being and Time

II.v

are anything like circumstances, events, and destinies ontologically pos­
sible? Why does precisely the past have an important function in the
" temporal" characterization of Da-sein occurring "in time"?
If his tory belongs to the being of Da-sein, and if this being is
grounded in temporality, it seems logical to begin the existential analy­
sis of historicity with

the

characteristics of what is historical that evi­

dently have a temporal meaning. Thus a more precise characterization
of the remarkable priority of the "past" in the concept of history should
prepare the exposition of the fundamental constitution of historicity.

380

The "antiquities" preserved in museums (for example, household
things) belong to a "time past," and are yet still objectively present in the
"present." How are these useful things historical when they are, after all ,

not yet

past? Only because they became an

object

of historiographical

interest, of the cultivation of antiquity and national lore? But such useful

historiographical objects because they are
historical. We repeat the question: With what jus­

things can only, after all, be
somehow in themselves

tification do we call these beings historical when they are not yet past?
Or do these "things" "in themselves" yet have " something past" about
them although they are still objectively present today?

Are these

obj ec­

tively present things then still what they were? Evidently these " things"
have changed . The tools have become fragile and worm-eaten " in the
course of time. " But yet

the

specific character of the past that makes

them something historical does not lie in this transience that continues
even during their obj ective presence in the museum. But then what is
past about the useful thing? What were the " things" that they no longer
are today? They are still defmite useful things, but out of use. However,
if they were still in use, like many heirlooms in the household, would
they then not be historical? Whether in use or out of use, they are no
longer what they were. What is "past"? Nothing other than the

world

within which they were encountered as things at hand belonging to a
context of useful things and used by heedful Da-sein existing-in-the­
world. That

world is

no longer. But what was previously

innerworldly

in

that world is s till objectively present. As useful things belonging to that

From this preliminary analysis of the useful things belonging to his­
tory that are still objectively present and yet somehow "past," it becomes
clear that this kind of being is historical only on the basis of its belonging
to the world. But the world has a historical kind of being because it
constitutes an ontological determination of Da-sein. Furthermore, we
can see that when one designates a time as " the past," the meaning of
this is not unequivocal, but " the past" is manifestly distinct from the

having-been,

which we got to know as a constituent of the ecstatic unity of

the temporality of Da-sein. But thus the enigma ultimately only becomes
more acute; why is that precisely the "past" or, more appropriately, the
having-been predominately determines what is historical when, after all ,
having-been temporalizes itself equiprimordially with present and future.

encountered within the world, not only useful

things at hand in the broadest sense, but also nature in the surrounding
world as the "historical ground." We call beings unlike Da-sein that are
historical by reason of their belonging to the world that which is world­
historical. We can show that the vulgar concept of "world history" arises
precisely from our orientation toward what is secondarily historical.
What is world-historical is not first historical on the basis of a historio­
graphical objectivation, but rather

as the being that it is

in itself encoun­

tered in the world.
The analysis of the historical character of a useful thing still objec­
tively present not only led us back to Da-sein as what is primarily his­
torical, but at the same time made it dubious whether the temporal
characteristics of what is historical should be primarily oriented toward
the being-in-time of something objectively present at all . Beings do not
become "more historical" as we go on to a past ever farther away, so that
what is most ancient would be the most authentically historical. But the
" temporal" distance from now and today again has no primarily constitutive significance for the historicity of authentically historical beings,
not because they are not "in time" or are timeless, but rather because
they primordially exist

temporally in a way that nothing objectively present

"in time," whether passing away or coming into being, could ever, by its
ontological essence, be temporal in such a way.

It will be said that these are overly compli cated remarks. No one
denies that human existence is basically the primary "subj ect" of his­
tory, and the vulgar concept of history cited says this clearly enough. But
the thesis that "Da-sein is historical" not only means the onti c fact that
human being presents a more or less important "atom" in the business
of world history, and remains the plaything of circumstances and events,
but poses the problem why and on the basis of what ontological conditions,
does historicity belong to the subjectivity of the "historical" subject as its essential
constitution?

74. The Essential Constitution of Historicity
Factically, Da-sein always has its "history, " and it can have something
of the s ort because the being of this being is constituted by historicity.
We want to justify this thesis with the intention of setting forth the

logical

onto­

problem of history as an existential one. The being of Da-sein

was defined as care. Care is grounded in temporality. Within the scope
of temporality we must accordingly search for an occurrence that deter­
mines existence as historical. Thus the interpretation of the historicity of
Da-sein turns out to be basically just a more concrete development of
temporality. We revealed temporality initially with regard to the mode of
authentic existing that we characterized as anticipatory resolution. Why
does this involve an authentic occurrence of Da-sein?
We determined resoluteness as self-projection upon one' s own
being guilty4 that is reticent and ready for Angst. It attains its authenticity
as

anticipatory resoluteness.5 In it, Da-sein understands itself with regard to

its potentiality-of-being in a way that confronts death in order to take
over completely the being that it itself is in its thrownness. Resolutely tak­
ing over one's own factical "Ther e " means at the same time the resolve

383

for

the

situation. In the existential analytic we cannot, on principle, dis­

cuss what Da-sein factically resolves upon. Our present inquiry excludes
even the existential project of factical possibilities of existence. Never­
theless, we must ask whence

in general

can the possibilities be drawn

upon which Da-sein factically projects itself? Anticipatory self-proj ection
upon

the

possibility of existence not to-be-bypassed-on death-guaran­

tees only the totality and authenticity of resoluteness. But the factically
disclosed possibilities of existence are not to be taken from death. All the
less so since anticipation of that possibility is not a speculation about it,
but rather precisely signifies coming back to the factical There. Is taking
over the thrownne ss of the self into its world supposed to disclose a hori­
zon from which existence seizes its factical possibilities? Did we not more­
over say that Da-sein never gets behind its thrownne ssj>fi Before we rashly
decide whether Da-sein draws its authentic possibilities of existence from

II.v

Being and Time

35 1

thrownness or not, we must assure ourselves of the complete concept of
this fundamental determination of care.
It is true that Da-sein is delivered over to itself and its potentiality­
of-being, but as being-in-the-world. As thrown, it is dependent upon a
"world," and exists factically with others. Initially and for the most part,
the self is lost in the they. It understands itself in terms of the possibili­
ties of existence that "circulate" in the actual "average" public inter­
pretedness of Da-sein today. Mostly they are made unrecognizable by
ambiguity, but they are still familiar. Authentic existentiell understand­
ing is so far from extricating itself from traditional interpretedness that
it always grasps its chosen possibility in resolution from that interpreta­
tion and in opposition to it, and yet again for it.
The resoluteness in which Da-sein comes back to itself discloses the
actual factical possibilities of authentic existing in tenns of the heritage
which that resoluteness takes over as thrown. Resolute coming back to
thrownness involves handing oneself over to traditional possibilities,
although not necessarily as traditional ones. If everything "good" is a
matter of heritage and if the character of "goodness" lies in making
authentic existence possible, then handing down a heritage is always
constituted in resoluteness. The more authentically Da-sein resolves
itself, that is, understands itself unambiguously in terms of its ownmost
eminent possibility in anticipating death, the more unequivocal and
inevitable is the choice in finding the possibility of its existence. Only the
anticipation of death drives every chance and "preliminary" possibility
out. Only being free for death gives Da-sein its absolute goal and knocks
existence into its finitude. The finitude of existence thus seized upon
tears one back out of endless multiplicity of possibilities offering themselves nearest by-those of comfort, shirking and taking things easyand brings Da-sein to the simplicity of its fate. This is how we designate
the primordial occurrence of Da-sein that lies in authentic resoluteness
in which it hands itself down to itself, free for death, in a possibility that it
inherited and yet has chosen.
Da-sein can only be reached by the blows of fate because in the
basis of its being it is fate in the sense described. Existing fatefully in res­
oluteness handing itself down, Da-sein is disclosed as being-in-the-world
for the "coming" of "fortunate" circumstances and for the cruelty of
chance. Fate does not first originate with the collision of circumstances
and events. Even an irresolute person is driven by them, more so than
someone who has chosen, and yet he can "have" no fate.
When Da-sein, anticipating, lets death become powerful in itself, as
free for death it understands itself in its own higher power, the power of
its finite freedom, and takes over the powerlessness of being abandoned to
itself in that freedom, which always only is in having chosen the choice,

384

352

Being and Time

II.v

and becomes clear about the chance elements in the situation disclosed.
But if fateful Da-sein essentially exists as being-in-the-world in being­
with others, its occurrence is an occurrence-with and is determined as

destiny.

With this term, we designate the occurrence of the community,

of a people. Destiny is not composed of individual fates, nor can being­
with-one-another be conceived of as the mutual occurrence of several
subjects. 7 These fates are already guided beforehand in being-with-one­
another in the same world and in the resoluteness for definite possibil­
i ties. In communication and in battle the power of destiny first becomes

385

free. The fateful destiny of Da-sein in and with its "generation"8 consti­
tutes the complete, authentic occurrence of Da-sein
As the powerless higher power preparing itself for adversities, the
power of reticent self-projection, ready for Ang.5t, upon one's own being­
guilty, fate requires the constitution of being of care as the ontological
condition of its possibility, that is, temporality. Only if death, guilt, con­
science, freedom, and finitude live together equiprimordially in the
being of a being as they do in care, can that being exist in the mode of
fate, that is, be historical in the ground of its existence.

Only a being that is essentially futural in its being so that it can let itself
be throum back upon itsfactical There, free for its death and shattering itself on
it, that is, only a being that, as futura� is equiprimordially having-been, can
hand doum to itself its inherited possibility, take over its own thrownness and be
in the Moment for "its time. " Only authentic temporality that is at the same
time finite makes something like fate, that is, authentic historicity, possible.
It is not necessary that resoluteness explicitly know of the prove­
nance of its possibilities upon which it proj ects itself. However, in the
temporality of Da-sein, and only in it, lies the possibility of fetching the
existentiell p otentiality-of-being upon which it proj ects itself

that is, going back to the possibilities of the Da-sein that has

been there. The authentic retrieve of a possibility of existence that has
been-the possibility that Da-sein may choose its heroes-is existentially
grounded in anticipatory resoluteness; for in resoluteness the choice is
first chosen that makes one free for the struggle to come, and the loyalty
to what can be retrieved. The handing down of a possibility that has
been in retrieving it, however, does not disclose the Da-sein that has
been there in order to actualize it again. The retrieve of what is possible

386

neither brings back "what is past, " nor does it bind the "present" back to
what is "outdated. " Arising from a resolute self-projection, retrieve is not
convinced by "something pas t, " in just letting it come back as what was
once real. Rather, retrieve

responds

to the possibility of existence that has-

been-there. But responding to the possibility in a resolution is at the
same time,

in the Moment, the disavowal

of what is working itself out

today as the "pas t. " Retrieve neither abandons itself to the past, nor
does it aim at progress. In the Moment, authentic existence is indifferent
to both of these alternatives .
We characterize retrieve as the mode of resolution handing itself
down, by which Da-sein exists explicitly as fate. But if fate constitutes the
primordial historicity of Da-sein, history has its essential weight neither
in what is past nor in the today and its "connection" with what is past,
but in the authentic occurrence of existence that arises from the future of
Da-sein. As a mode of being of Da-sein, history has its roots so essentially
in the future that death, as the possibility of Da-sein we characterized,
throws anticipatory existence back upon its factical thrownness and thus

having-been its unique priority in what is historical.
Authentic being-toward-death, that is, the finitude of temporality, is the con­
cealed ground of the historicity ofDa-sein. Da-sein does not first become his­
first gives to the

torical in retrieve, but rather because as temporal it is historical, it can
take its elf over in its history, retrieving itself. Here no historiography is
needed as yet.
We call the anticipatory handing oneself down to the There of
the Moment that lies in resoluteness fate. In it destiny is also grounded,
by which we understand the occurrence of Da-sein in being-with-oth­
ers. Fateful destiny can be explicitly disclosed in retrieve with regard to
its being bound up with the heritage handed down to it. Repetition first
makes manifest to Da-sein its own history. Retrieve first reveals to Da­
sein its own history. The occurrence itself and the disclosedness belong­
ing to it, or the appropriation of it, is existentially grounded in the fact
that Da-sein is ecstatically open as a temporal being.
What we characterized as historicity in conformity with the occurrence lying in anticipatory resoluteness, we shall call the

authentic

his­

toricity of Da-sein. It became clear in terms of the phenomena of handing down and retrieve, rooted in the future, why the occurrence of
authentic history has its weight in having-been. However, it remains all
the more enigmatic how this occurrence, as fate, is to constitute the
whole " connection" of Da-sein from its birth to its death . What can
going back to resoluteness add to this by way of clarification? Is not
each resolution just

one

more single "experience" in the succession of the

whole connection of experiences? Is the " connection" of authentic
occurrence supposed to consist of an uninterrupted succession of reso­
lutions? Why does the question of the constitution of the "connection of
life" not find an adequate and satisfactory answer? Is not our inquiry
overhasty? Does it not, in the end, cling too much to the answer, without
having tested the

question

beforehand as to its legitimacy? No thing

Being and Time

became more clear from the course of th e exis te nti al an aly tic so far
than the fact that the ontology of Da-sein falls prey to the temptations of
the vulgar understanding of b eing again and again. We can cope with
this methodically only by pursuing

the origin of the

question of th e con­

stitution of the connection of Da-sein, no matter how "self-evident" this
question may be, an d by determining in what ontological horizon it
moves .
If historicity belongs to the being of Da-sein, then even inauthentic
existence must be historical. Did the

inauthentic

historicity of Da-sein

determine our line of questioning about a "connection of life" and block
the access to authentic his torici ty and the "connection" peculiar to i t?
However that may be, if the exposition of the ontological problem of his­
tory is supposed to be adequate and complete, we cannot escape con­

sidering the inauthentic hi s toric i ty of Da-sein.

75. The Historicity of Da-sein and World History
Initially and for the most part, Da-sein understands itself in terms of
what it en coun te rs in the surrounding world and what it circumspectly
takes care of. Understanding is not just a bare taking cognizance of

i ts e lf which simply accompanies all the modes of behavior of Da-sein.
Unders tanding si gnifi e s self-proj ection upon th e actual poss ib i l i ty of
being-in-the-world, that is, exi s ting as this possibility. Thus understand­

ing, as common sense, also constitutes the inauthentic existence of the

they. What everyday taking care of things encounters in public be ing­

which "one" "swims along" with it "oneself." One always knows about it,
talks about it, furthers it, fi ghts it, retains it, and forgets it primarily
with regard to

what is being done and what will "come out of it." We ini­

tially calculate the progress, arrest, adjustment, and "output" of in di­
vidual Da-sein in terms of the course, status, change, and availability of
what is taken care of. As trivial as the reference to the unders tan ding of
Da-sein of everyday common sense may be, ontologically this under­

standing is b y no means transparent. But then why should the "con­

nectedness" of Da-sein not be determined in terms of what is taken care
of and "experienced"? Do not useful things and works and every thi ng
that Da-sein spends time with also belong to " hi story" ? Is the occur­
rence of history then only the isolated course of " stre ams of experi­
ence" in individual subjects ?

Being and Time

Il.v

355

Indeed, history is neither the connectedness of movements in the
alteration of objects, nor the free-floating succession of experiences of
"subjects." Does the occurrence of history then pertain to the "linking" of
subject and object? Even if one assigns occurrence to the subject-object
relationship, then we must ask about the kind of being of this linking as
such, if it is that which basically " occurs ." The thesis of the historicity of
Da-sein does not say that the worldless subject is historical, but that what
is historical is the being that exists as being-in-the-world. The occurrence of
history is the occurrence of being-in-the-world. The historicity of Da-sein is
essentially the historicity of the world which, on the basis of its ecstatic
and horizonal temporality, belongs to the temporalizing of that tempo­
rality. When Da-sein factically exists, it alrea:dy encounters beings dis­
covered within the world. With the existence of historical being-in-the-world,
things at hand and objectively present have always already been included in the
history of the world. Tools and works, for example books, have their "fates";
buildings and institutions have their history. And even nature is historical.
It is

not

historical when we speak about "natural history,"9 but nature is

historical as a countryside, as areas that have been inhabited or exploited,
as battlefields and cultic sites. These innerworldly beings as such are his­
torical, and their history does not signify something "external" that simply accompanies the "inner" history of the "soul." We shall call these
beings

world-historical.

Here we must observe that the expression "world

history" that we have chosen and that is here understood ontologically ,
has a double meaning. On the one hand, it signifies the occurrence of
world in its essential existent unity with Da-sein. But at the same time it
means the innerworldly "occurrence" of what is at hand and obj ectively
present, since innerworldly beings are always discovered with the factically existent world. The historical world is factically only as the world of
innerworldly beings. What " occurs" with tools and works as such has its
own character of motion, and this character has been completely obscure
up to now. For example, a ring that is "presented" and "worn" does not
simply undergo a change of location in its being. The movement of
occurrence in which "something happens to it" cannot be grasped at all
in terms of motion as change of location. That is true of all world-historical "processes" and events, and in a way even of "catastrophes of nature."
Quite apart from the fact that we would necessarily go beyond the limits
of our theme if we were to pursue the problem of the ontological structure of world-historical occurrence, we canno t do this because the intention of this exposition is to lead us to the ontological enigma of the

movement Qf occurrence in general.
We only want to delimit

that

range of phenomena that we also

necessarily have in mind ontologically when we speak about the his­
toricity of Da-sein. On the basis of the temporally founded transcen-

389

dence of the world, what is world-his torical is always already "obj ec­
tively" there in the occurrence of exis ting being-in-the-world,

being grasped historiographically.

without

And since factical Da-sein is abs orbed

and entangled in what it takes care of, it initially understands its his­
tory as world history. And since, furthermore, the vulgar understanding
of being understands "being" as objective presence without further dif­
ferentiation, the being of what is world-historical is experienced and
interpreted in the sense of objective presence that comes along, is pre­
sent, and disappears. And finally since the meaning of being in general
is taken to be what is absolutely self-evident, the question of the kind of
being of what is world-historical and of the movement of occurrence in
general is "after all really" only unfruitful and unneces sarily compli­
cated verbal sophistry.
Everyday Da-sein is dispersed in the multiplicity of what "happens"

390

daily. The opportunities and circumstances that taking care keeps " tac­
tically" awaiting in advance, result in "fate. " Inauthentically existing Da­
sein first calculates its history in terms of what it takes care of. In so
doing, it is driven about by its "affairs. " So if it wants to come to itself, it
must first pull

itself together from

the

dispersion and

the

disconnectedness of

what has just "happened," and because of this, it is only then that there
at last arises from the horizon of the understanding of inauthentic his­
toricity the

question

of how one is to establish Da-sein's "connectedness"

if one does s o in the sense of the experiences of the subject "also" objec­
tively present. The possibility that this horizon for the question should
be the dominant one, is grounded in irresoluteness that constitutes the
essence of the in-constancy of the self.
We have thus pointed out the

origin

of the question of Da-sein's

"connectedness" in the sense of the unity with which experiences are
linked together between birth and death. At the same time, the prove­
nance of this question betrays its inappropriateness with regard to a
primordial existential interpretation of the totality of occurrence of Da­
sein. But, on the o ther hand, with the predominance of this "natural"
horizon of questioning, it becomes explicable why precisely the authen­
tic historicity of Da-sein-fate and retrieve-looks as if it, least of all,
could provide the phenomenal basis for bringing into the form of an
ontologically founded problem what is fundamentally intended with
the question of the "connectedness of life . "
Thi s question

can

not ask: how does Da-sein acquire such a unity of

connection that it can subsequently link together the succession of
" experiences" that has ensued and is still ensuing; rather, it asks in which
of its own kinds of being does it lose itself in such a way that it must, as it
were, pull itself together only subsequently out of its dispersion, and think up for
itself a unity in which this together is embraced? Lostness in the they and in

world history, revealed itself earlier as a flight from death. This flight
from . . . reveals being- toward-death as a fundamental determination of
care. Anticipatory resoluteness brings this being-toward-death to authentic existence. But we interpreted the occurrence of this resoluteness
that anticipates and hands down and retrieves the heritage of possibilities, as authentic his toricity. Does perhaps the primordial s tretching
along of the whole of existence, which is not lost and does not need a
connection, lie in historicity? The resoluteness of the self against the

steadiness that has been stretched
along-the steadiness in which Da-sein as fate "incorporates" into its exisinconstancy of dispersion is in itself a

tence birth and death and their "between" in such a way that in such
constancy it is in the Moment for what is world-historical in its actual sit­
uation. In the fateful retrieve of possibilities that have-been, Da-sein
brings itself back "immediately," that is, temporally and ecstatically, to
what has already been before it. But when its heritage is thus handed
down to itself, "birth" is

taken into existence

in coming back from the

possibility of death (the possibility not-to-be-bypassed) so that existence
may accept the thrownness of its own There more free from illusion.
Resoluteness constitutes the
resoluteness ready for

Angst,

loyalty of existence

to its own self. As

loyalty is at the same time a possible rev­

erence for the sole authority that a free existence can have, for the pos­
sibilities of existence that can be retrieved. Resoluteness would be mis­
understood ontologically if one thought that it

is real as

" experience"

only as long as the "act" of resolution "lasts." In resoluteness lies the exis­
tentiell constancy which, in keeping with its essence, has already antici­
pated every possible Moment arising from it. As fate, resoluteness is
freedom to give up a definite resolution, as may be required in the situ­
ation. Thus the steadiness of existence is not interrupted, but precisely
confirmed in the Moment. Constancy is not first formed either through
or by "Moments" adjoining each other, but rather the Moments arise
fro m the temporality,

already stretched along,

of that retrieve which is

futurally in the process of having-been.
On the other hand, in inauthentic historicity the primordial
s tretching along of fate is concealed. With the inconstancy of the they­
self, Da-sein makes present its " today." Awaiting the next new thing, it
has already forgotten what is old. The they evades choice. Blind toward
possibilities, it is incapable of retrieving what has been, but only retains
what is and receives "real, " what has been left over, of the world-histor­
ical that has been, the remnan ts, and the information about them that is

objectively present. Lost in the making present of the today, it under­

stands the "past" in terms of the "present. " In contrast, the temporality
of authentic historicity, as the Moment that anticipates and retrieves,

undoes

the making present of the today and the habituation to the con-

39 1

358

Il.v

Being and Time

ventionalities of the they. Inauthentic historical existence, on the other
hand, is burdened with the legacy of a "past" that has become unrecog­
nizable to it, looks for what is modern. Authentic his toricity under­
s tands history as the "recurrence" of what is possible and knows that a

392

possibility recurs only when existence is open for it fatefully, in the
Moment, in resolute retrieve.
The existential interpretation of the historicity of Da-sein con­
stantly gets eclipsed unawares. The obscurities are all the more diffi­
cult to dispel when the possible dimensions of appropriate questioning
are not disentangled and when everything is haunted by the

being and,

enigma of

as has now become clear, of movement. Nevertheless, we may

venture a project of the ontological genesis of historiography as a science
in terms of the historicity of Da-sein. It should serve as a preparation for

the clarification of the task of a historical destructuring of the history of

philosophy10 to be carried out in what follows.

76. The Existential Origin of Historiography

from the Historicity of Da-sein
That historiography, like every science as a mode of being of Da-sein, is

factically and actually " dependent" upon the " dominant worldview"

needs no discussion. However, beyond this fact, we must inquire into the
ontological possibility of the origin of the sciences from the constitution
of being of Da-sein . This origin is still not very transparent. In the pre­
sent context our analysis will familiarize us in outline with the existential
origin of historiography only to the extent that it will throw more light
upon the historicity of Da-sein, and its roots in temporality.
If the being of Da-sein is in principle historical, then every factical
science evidently remains bound to this occurrence. But historiography
presupposes the historicity of Da-sein in its own distinctive way.
At first one wants to clarify that by referring to the fact that histo­
riography, as a science of the history of Da-sein, must "presuppose" the
being that is primordially historical as its possible "object. " But his tory
must not only

be in

order for a historiographical object to be accessible;

and historiographical cognition, as an actual mode of behavior of Da­

historiographical disclosure of history
is in itself rooted in the historicity ofDa-sein in accordance with its ontological
structure, whether it is factically carried out or not. This connection is
sein, is not only historical. Rather, the

what the talk about the existential origin of historiography from the

393

historicity of Da-sein means. To throw light on this connection means
methodically to project ontologically the

idea of historiography in terms

of the historicity of Da-sein. On the other hand, it is not a matter of
" abstracting" the concept of historiography from some factical proce-

II.V

Being and Time

359

dure of the sciences today nor of assimilating it to that procedure. For
what guarantee do we have in principle that this factical procedure
indeed represents historiography's primordial and authentic possibili­
ties? And even if that is true (we shall not decide now) then the concept
could still be "discovered" in fact only if guided by the idea of histori­
ography that had already been understood. However, on the other
hand, the existential idea of historiography is not given a higher justi­
fication if the historian's factical mode of behavior confirms it by agree­
ing with it. Nor does the idea become "false" if he contests any such
agreement.
The idea of historiography as a science implies that it has grasped
the disclosure of historical beings as its own task. Every science is pri­
marily constituted by thematization. What is known prescientifically in
Da-sein as disclosed being-in-the-world is projected upon its specific
being. The region of beings is limited by this project. The accesses to it
contain their methodical "directive," and the conceptual structure of
interpretation is outlined. If we may postpone the question of whether a
"history of the present" is possible and assign to historiography the task
of disclosing the "past," the historiographical thematization of history is
possible only if the "past" has always already been disclosed in general.
Quite apart from the question of whether sufficient sources are available
for a historiographical envisagement of the past, the way to it must be
open in general for the historiographical return to it. That something like
this is true and how it is possible is by no means obvious.
But since the being of Da-sein is historical, that is, since it is open
in its character of having-been on the basis of ecstatical and horizonal
temporality, the way is in general freed for such thematization of the
"past" as can be carried out in existence. And because Da-sein and only
Da-sein is primordially historical, what historiographical thematization
presents as the possible object of its investigation must have the kind of
being of Da-sein that has-been-there. Together with factical Da-sein as
being-in-the-world, there is also always world history. If Da-sein is no
longer there, then the world, too, is something that has-been-there. This
is not in conflict with the fact that what was formerly at hand within the
world does not yet pas s away, but is available "historiographically" for
the present as something that has not passed away and belongs to the
world that has-been-there.
Remains, monuments, and records that are still objectively pre­
sent are possible "material" for the concrete disclosure of Da-sein that has­
been-there. These things can become historiographical material only
because they have a world-historica l character in accordance with their
own kind of being. And they become such material only by being under­
stood from the outset with regard to their innerworldliness . The world

394

360

II.v

Being and Time

already projected is determined by way of an interpretation of the world­

historical material that has been "preserved. " The acquisition, sifting,

and securing of such material does not first bring about a return to the
"past, " but rather already presupposes

historical being toward the Da-sein

that has-been-there, that is, the historicity of the historian's existence. His
existence existentially grounds historiography as science, down to the
most trivial, "mechanical" procedures. 1 1
I f historiography i s rooted i n historicity i n thi s way, then we should
also be able to determine from there what the

object of historiography

"really" is. The delimitation of the primordial theme of historiography
must be carried out in conformity with authentic historicity and its dis­
closure of what-has-been-there, of retrieve. Retrieve understands Da­
sein that has-been-there in its authentic possibility that has-been. The
"birth" of historiography from authentic historicity then means that the
primary thematization of the object of historiography projects Da-sein
that has-been-there upon its ownmost potentiality-of-existence. Does his­
toriography thus have

what is possible

as its theme? Does not its whole

"meaning" lie in "facts, " in what has factually been?
However, what does it mean that Da-sein "factually " is? If Da-sein is
"really" actual only in existence, its "factuality" is, after all , constituted
precisely by its resolute self-projection upon a chosen potentiality-of­
being. What has "factually" really been there, however, is then the exis­
tentiell possibility in which fate, destiny, and world history are factically
determined. Because existence always is only as factically thrown, histo­
riography will disclose the silent power of the possible with greater pen­
etration the more simply and concretely it understands having-been-in­
the-world in terms of its possibility, and "just" presents it.

395

If historiography, which itself arises from authentic historicity,
reveals by retrieve the Da-sein that has-been-there in its possibility, it
has also already made the "universal" manifest in what is unique. The
question of whether historiography only has as its object a series of
unique, "individual" events, or whether it also has "laws, " is radically
mistaken. Neither what only occurs uniquely nor something universal
above these is its theme, but rather the possibility that has been factically
existent. This possibility is not retrieved as such, that is, authentically
understood historiographically, if it is distorted into the pall o r of a
supratemporal pattern. Only factically authentic historicity, as resolute
fate, can disclose the history that has-been-there in such a way that in
retrieve the "power" of the possible breaks into factical existence, that is,
comes toward it in its futurality. Historiography by no means takes its
point of departure from the "present" and what is "real" only today,
any more than does the historicity of unhis torical Da-sein, and then
grope its way back from there to a past. Rather, even

historiographical dis-

II.v

Being and Time

361

closure temporalizes itself out of the future. The "selection" of what is to
become a possible object for historiography has already been made in the
factical existentiell choice of the historicity of Da-sein, in which histori­
ography first arises and is uniquely.
The historiographical disclosure of the "past" is grounded in fate­
ful retrieve and is so far from being "subjective" that it alone guarantees
the "objectivity" of historiography. For the objectivity of a science is pri­
marily regulated by the question whether that science can unconcealedly
confront understanding with the being belonging to it as its theme in
the primordiality of its being. In no science are the "universal validity" of
standards and the claims to "universality" that are demanded by the
they and its common sense less possible criteria of " truth" than in
authentic historiography.
Only because the central theme of historiography is always the
possibility of existence that has-been-there, and because the latter always
factically exists in a world-historical way, can historiography demand of
its elf a relentless orientation toward "facts . " For this reason factical
research has many branches and makes the history of useful things,
works, culture, spirit, and ideas its object. At the same time history,
handing itself down, is in itself always in an interpretedness that belongs
to it, and that has a history of its own; so that for the most part it is only
through traditional history that historiography penetrates into what hasbeen-there itself. This explains why concrete historiographical research
can always keep to its authentic theme in varying degrees of nearness.
The historian who from the outset has "projected" upon the "worldview" of an era has not yet proven that he understands his subject-matter
authentically and historically and not just "aesthetically." On the other
hand, the existence of a historian who "only" edits sources may be deter­
mined by an authentic historicity.
Thus the dominance of a differentiated historiographical interest,
even in the most remote and primitive cultures, is in itself no proof of
the authentic historicity of an "age." Ultimately, the rise of the problem
of "historicism" is the clearest indication that historiography strives to
alienate Da-sein from its authentic historicity. Historicity does not nec­
essarily need historiography. Unhistoriographical ages are as such not
also automatically unhistorical.
The possibility that historiography in general can be either an
"advantage" or a "disadvantage" . . . for "life" is based on the fact that life
is historical in the roots of its being and has thus, factically existing,
always already decided upon authentic or inauthentic historicity. Niet­
zsche recognized what is essential about "advantage and disadvantage of
historiography for life" in the second of his Untimely Meditations ( 1874)
and stated it unequivocally and penetratingly. He distinguishes three

396

362

Il.v

Being and Time

kinds of historiography: the monumental, the antiquarian, and the crit­
ical, without demonstrating explicitly the necessity of this triad and the
ground of its unity. The threefold character of historiography is prefigured in
the historicity of Da-sein. At the same time historicity enables us to under­
stand why authentic his toriography must be the factical and concrete
unity of these three possibilities. Nietzsche's division is not accidental.
The beginning of his

Untimely Meditations

makes us suspect that he

understood more than he made known.
As historical, Da-sein is possible only on the basis of temporality.
Temporality temporalizes itself in the ecstatic-horizonal unity of its rap­
tures. Da-sein exists as futural authentically in the resolute disclosure of
a chosen possibility. Resolutely coming back to its elf, it is open in
retrieve for the "monumental" possibilities of human existence. The
historiography arising from this historicity is "monumental." As having­
been, Da-sein is delivered over to its thrownness. In appropriating the
possible in retrieve, there is prefigured at the same time the possibility of
reverently preserving the existence that has-been-there, in which the

397

possibility grasped became manifest. As monumental, authentic histo­
riography is thus "antiquarian. " Da-sein temporalizes itself in the unity of
future and the having-been as the present. The present, as the Moment,
discloses the today authentically. But since the today is interpreted in
terms of unders tanding a possibility of exis tence grasped-an under­
standing that futurally retrieves-authentic historiography ceases to make
the today present, that is, it suffers itself to become detached from the
entangled publicness of the today. As authentic, monumental-antiquar­
i an his toriography is necessarily a critique of the "present. " Authentic
historicity is the foundation of the possible unity of the three kinds of
his toriography. But the
founded is

temporality

on which authentic historiography is

as the existential meaning of being of care.

The existential and historical origin of historiography may be pre­
sented concretely by analyzing the thematization that constitutes this sci­

But since the fundamental concepts of the historiographical

sciences-whether they pertain to the objects of these sciences or to the
way these are treated-are concepts of existence, the theory of the human­
istic sciences presupposes a thematic and existential interpretation of
the

historicity

of Da-sein. Such an interpretation is the constant goal that

Dilthey's investigations attempt to approach and that is illuminated more
penetratingly by the ideas of Count Yorck von Wartenburg.

77. The Connection of the Foregoing Exposition of the

Problem of Historicity with the Investigations
of Dilthey and the Ideas of Count Yorck
Our analysis of the problem of history grew out of an appropriation of
Dilthey's work. It was corroborated, and at the same time strengthened,
by Count Yorck's theses that are scattered throughout his letters to
Dilthey. 12
The image of Dilthey still prevalent today is that of the "sensitive"
interpreter of the history of the spirit, especially the history of literature,
who "also" concerned himself with the distinction between the natural
and the human sciences, attributing a distinctive role to the history of
these sciences and also to "psychology," then letting the whole merge
into a relativistic "philosophy of life." For a superficial consideration, this
sketch is "correct. " But it misses the "substance. " It covers over more
than it reveals.
Dilthey's investigations can be divided schematically into three
areas: psychology, in which the "whole fact of man" is presented and dif­
ferentiated from the natural sciences; investigations on the history of the
human sciences, society, and the state; and endeavors toward a psy­
chology in which the "whole fact of being human" is to be presented.
Investigations in scientific theory, the history of science, and hermeneu­
tical psychology constantly interpenetrate and overlap each other. When
one direction predominates, the others are motives and means. What
appears to be disunity and uncertain, chance "attempts," is an elemental
restlessness, of which the one goal is to understand "life" philosophically
and to secure for this understanding a hermeneutical foundation in
terms of "life itself." Everything is centered in the "psychology" that is
supposed to understand "life" in the historical context of its develop­
ment and its effects, as the

object

way in which human being is, as the possible
root of these sciences .

of the human s ciences and especially the

H ermeneutics is the s elf-clarification of this understanding; it is also
the methodology of historiography, though only in a derivative form.
In contemporaneous discussions, Dilthey's own investigations for
laying the foundations for the humanistic sciences were forced one-sid­
edly into the field of a theory of science; and it was with a regard for
such discussions that his publications were often oriented in this direc­
tion. The "logic of the human s ciences" was by no means central for

him-no more than h e was s triving in his "psychology " inerely to
improve the positivistic science of the psychical.

Dilthey's friend, C ount Yorck, gives unambiguous expression to
Dilthey's ownmost philosophical tendency when he refers to our com­
mon interest in understanding historicity (Heidegger's italics).15 Dilthey's

398

364

399

Being and Time

II. v

investigations are only now becoming accessible in their complete scope,
if we are to make them our own we need the constancy and concretion
of coming to terms with them in principle. This is not the place14 for a
detailed discussion of the problems that motivated him or how they
motivated him. We shall, however, describe in a provisional way some of
Count Yorck's central ideas by selecting characteristic passages from
the letters.
In these communications Yorck's own tendency is brought to life
by Dilthey's questions and work, and this tendency can be seen in his
stance with regard to the tasks of the fundamental discipline-analytical
psychology. About Dilthey's academy treatise, "Ideas on a Descriptive
and Analytic Psychology," he writes:
It is definitely established that self-reflection is the primary means
of knowing, and that the primary procedure of knowing is anal­
ysis. From this standpoint principles are formulated that are ver­
ified by their own findings. No progress is made toward criti­
cally breaking down constructive psychology and its assumptions,
explaining it and thus refuting it from within. . . . Your disre­
gard for breaking things down critically (i.e., for demonstrating
their provenance psychologically and carrying this out tren­
chantly in detail) is, in my opinion, connected with your concept
of the theory of knowledge and the position you assign to it.
(Briefwechsel, p. 1 77)
The explanation of inapplicability-the fact is set up and made
dear-is given only by a theory of knowledge. It has to give justifi­
cations for the adequacy of scientific methods; it has to provide the
grounds for a doctrine of method, instead of having its methods
taken from individual areas, at a venture, I must say. (p. 1 79)
At bottom Yorck is demanding a logic preceding the sciences and
guiding them as did Platonic and Aristotelian logic, and this demand
includes the task of developing, positively and radically, the various cat­
egorial structures of the being that is nature and the being that is history
(Da-sein). Yorck finds that Dilthey's investigations "too little emphasize
the generic difference between the ontic and the historical" (p. 191, Heidegger's
italics).

400

In particular, the procedure of comparison is claimed as the
method of the human sciences. Here I disagree with you . . . . Com­
parison is always aesthetic and is bound to form. Windelband
assigns forms to history. Your concept of the type is an entirely

Being and Time

II.v

365

inward one. Here it is a matter of characteristics, not forms. For
Windelband, history is a series of pictures, individual forms, aes­
thetic demands. For the natural scientist, besides science, only aes­
thetic pleasure remains as a kind of human tranquillizer. Your
concept of history is, after all, that of a nexus of forces, unities of
force, to which the category of form should be applied only in a
symbolic sense. (p.

193)

In terms of his certain instinct for the " difference between the
ontic and the historical," Yorck knew how strongly traditional historical
investigation is geared to "purely ocular determinations" (p.

192) that

aim at what has body and form.
Ranke is a great ocularist, for whom things that have vanished can
never become realities. . .

.

Ranke's whole manne r can be explained

in terms of his limiting the stuff of history to the political. Only the
political is dramatic. (p. 60)

The modifications that have come in the cours e of time seem
inessential to me, and here I probably judge differently from you.
For example, I think that the so-call ed historical school is merely a
side-current within the same riverbed, and represents only one
branch of an old and thorough-going opposition. The name has
something deceptive about it.

That school was not historical at all [Hei­

degger's italics], but rather an antiquarian one, construing things aes­
thetically, whereas the great, dominating movement was one of
mechanical construction. Thus what it added methodically to the
method of rationality was only a general feeling. (pp. 68f.)
The genuine philologian-he conceives of historiography as a cab­
inet of antiquities . Where nothing is palpable-where only a liv­
ing psychical transposition guides us-these gentlemen never get
there. At heart they are natural scientists, and they become skeptics
all the more because there are no experiments. One must keep
completely away from the petty details, for example, how often
Plato was is Magna Graecia or Syracuse. There is no vitality in
that. This superficial affectation that I have seen through critically,
finally boils down to a large question mark and is put to shame by
the great realities of Plato, Homer, and the New Testament. Every­
thing real becomes a schema when it is considered as a "thing in

itself," when it is not experienced. (p. 6 1 )

Th e "scientists" confront th e powers o f the time i n a way similar to
the over-refined French society of the revolutionary period. Here

366

II.v

Being and Time

as there, formalism, the cult of form, the defining of relationship is
the last word of wisdom. Of course, this direction of thought has

401

its own history that, I believe, i s n o t yet written. The groundless­
ness of this thinking and of the faith in it (and such thinking is,
epistemologically considered, a metaphysical attitude) is a histori­
cal product. (p.

39)

The groundswells evoked by the principle of eccentricity that led to
a new time more than four hundred years ago seem to me to have
become exceedingly broad and flat; knowledge has progressed to
the point of negating itself; man has become so far removed from
himself that he has lost sight of himself. "Modem man," i.e., man
since the Renaissance, is ready to he buried. (p.

83)

In contrast, "all written history that is alive and not just depicting life is
critique" (p.

19). "But historical knowledge is, for the best part, knowl­
1 09). "With history, what creates a spectacle

edge of hidden sources" (p.

and catches the eye is not the main thing. The nerves are invisible, as is
the essential in general. And as it is said that 'if you were quiet, you
would be strong,' the variation of this is also true: If you are quiet, you
will perceive, i.e., understand" (p.

26). "And then I enjoy the silent solil­

oquy and commerce with the spirit of history. This spirit did not appear
to Faust in his study, nor to Master Goethe either. They would not have
flinched from him in alarm, no matter how serious and compelling the
apparition was. For it is brotherly and akin to us in a sense deeper and
o ther than the inhabitants of bush and field. These exertions are like
Jacob's wrestling, a sure gain for the wrestler himself. That is what mat­
ters first of all" (p.

133).

Yorck gets his clear insight into the fundamental character of history
as "virtuality" from his knowledge of the characteristics of being of human
existence itself, thus precisely not in a theoretical and scientific way ori­
ented to the object of historical observation. That the whole psychophys­
ical datum is not [being is the objective presence of nature-Heidegger's
note], but lies in the core of historicity. And if self-reflection is directed not
to an abstract ego, but to the fullness of my self, it will find me historically
determined, just as physics knows me as cosmically determined. I am his­
tory as well as nature" (p.

71). And Yorck, who saw through all false "rela­

tional definitions" and "groundless" relativisms, did not hesitate to draw
the final conclusion from his insight into the historicity of Da-sein.
But, on the other hand, a systematic that is separated from his-

402

tory is methodologically inadequate for the inner historicity of

II.v

Being and Time

367

self-consciousness. Just as physiology cann o t be studied in abstrac­
tion from physics, neither can philosophy from historicity, espe­
cially if it is critical . . . . Self-relation and historicity are like breath­
ing and atmospheric pressure and, although this sounds rather
paradoxical, it seems to me methodologically like a residue of
metaphysics not to historicize philosophizing. (p. 69)
Since philosophizing is living, there is (don' t be alarmed) in my
opinion a philosophy of history-but who could write it! Certainly
not in the way that it has been interpreted and attempted up to
now, and you have declared yourself irrefutably against this. The
line of questioning up to now was simply false, even impossible,
but it is not the only one. Thus there is no longer any real philos­
ophizing that is not historical. The separation between system­
atic philosophy and historical presentation is essentially wrong.
(p. 25 1 )
Being able to become practical i s now, o f course, the real basis
for the justification of any science. But the mathematical praxis is
not the only one. The practical aim of our standpoint is the peda­
gogical one in the broadest and deepest sense of the word. It is the
soul of all true philosophy and the truth of Plato and Aristotle.
(pp. 42f. }
You know what I think about th e possibility of ethics a s a science.
Nevertheless, it can always be improved. Who are such books really
for? Registries about registries! The only thing worthy of notice
here is the drive from physics to ethics. (p. 73)
If one conceives of philosophy as a manifestation of life and not as
the expectoration of a groundless thinking (and such thinking
appears groundless because the view is turned away from the
ground of consciousness}, the task is as complicated and arduous
in its gain as it is meagre in its results . Freedom from prejudice is
what it presupposes, and that is difficult to obtain. (p. 250)
That Yorck set out to grasp the historical categorially, as opposed
to the antic (ocular) and to elevate "life" into its appropriate scientific
understanding, becomes clear from his reference to the kind of difficulty
of such investigations. The aesthetic and mechanistic kind of thinking
is more easily expressed verbally than an analysis that goes behind
intuition, and this can be explained by the wide extent to which
words have their provenance in the ocular .
On the other hand,

what penetrates to the ground of vitality eludes an exoteric pre­
sentation; hence all its terminology is not intelligible to all, it is
symbolic and inevitable. From the special kind of philosophical
thinking follows the special character of its linguistic expression.
(pp. 70f. )
But you are familiar with my predilection for paradox, which I
justify by the fact that paradox is a mark of truth, that the communis
opinio is surely never in the truth, but is like an elemental precipi­
tate of a halfway understanding that makes generalizations; in its
relationship to truth it is like the sulphurous fumes that lightning
leaves behind. Truth is never an element. To dissolve elemental
public opinion and, if possible, to make possible the shaping of
individuality in seeing and regarding, would be a pedagogical task
for the state. Then instead of a so-calle d public conscience-instead
of this radical externalization-individual conscience, i.e., con­
science, would again become powerful. (pp. 249f. )
I f one has an interest i n understanding historicity, one i s brought
to the task of developing the "generic difference between the ontic and
the historical." Thus we have ascertained thefundamental goal of the "phi­
losophy of life." Still, our line of questioning needs a more fundamental
radicalization. How else is historicity to be philosophically grasped and
"categorially" conceived in its difference from the ontic than by bringing
the "ontic" as well as the "historiographical" into a more primordial unity
so that they can be compared and distinguished? But that is possible
only if we attain the following insights:
1 . The question of historicity is an ontological question about the consti­
tution of being of historical beings.
2. The question of the ontic is the ontological question of the constitution
of being of beings unlike Da-sein, of what is objectively present in the
broadest sense.
3 . The ontic is only one area of beings .
The idea of being encompasses the "ontic" and the "historiographical."
This idea is what must be "generically differentiated. "
It is not by chance that Yorck calls nonhistorical beings simply the
ontic. That just reflects the unbroken dominance of traditional ontology
that, coming from the ancient questioning of being, holds fast to the
ontological problematic and fundamentally narrows it down. The prob­
lem of the difference between the ontic and the historiographical can be
worked out as a problem to be investigated only if it has made sure of its

II.V

Being and Time

369

guideline beforehand by clarifying, through fundamental ontology, the
question of the meaning of being in general.15 Thus it becomes clear in
what sense the preparatory existential and temporal analytic of Da-sein
is resolved to cultivate the spirit of Count Yorck in the service of
Dilthey's work.

404

VI

Temporality and Within-Timeness as the
Origin of the Vulgar Concept of Time

78. The Incompleteness of the Forego ing Temporal Analysis of Da-sein
To demonstrate that and how temporality constitutes the being of Da­
sein, we showed that historicity, as the constitution of being of exis­
tence, is "basically" temporality. Our interpretation of the temporal
nature of history was carried out without regard to the "fact" that every
occurrence runs its course "in time. " In the course of the existential
and temporal analysis of historicity, there was no room for the everyday

understanding of Da-sein that factically knows all history only as an

occurrence "within time." If the existential analytic is to make Da-sein

ontologically transparent in its very facticity, the factical, "ontic-tempo­

ral" interpretation of history must also explicitly be given its due. It is all
the more necessary that the time "in which" beings are encountered be
given a fundamental analysis, since not only history, but natural pro­
cesses, too, are determined "by time. " However, more elemental than
the circumstance that the " time factor" occurs in the

sciences of history

and nature, is the fact that, before all thematic investigation, Da-sein
" reckons with time" and orients itself according

to it.

And here again

the

"reckoning" of Da-sein "with its time" remains decisive, the reckoning
that precedes any use of instruments that are geared to determining
time. The reckoning is prior to such instruments, and first makes possi­
ble something like the use of clocks .
Factically existing, actual Da-sein either "has " " time " or it "has
none . " It either " takes time" or "cannot take time." Why does Da-sein

372

II.VI

Being and Time

take " time" and why can it "lose" it? From where does it take time? How
is this time related to the temporality of Da-sein?
Factical Da-sein takes account of time without existentially under­
s tanding temporality. The elemental mode of behavior of reckoning
with time must be clarified before we turn to the question of what it
means that beings are "in time." All the modes of behavior of Da-sein are

405

to be interpreted in terms of its being, that is, in terms of temporality.
We must show how Da-sein

as

temporality temporalizes a mode of

behavior that is related in such a way to time that it takes account of it.
Our characterization of temporality up to now is thus not only generally
incomplete, since we did not pay heed to all the dimensions of the phe­
nomenon, but it has fundamental gaps in it because something like
world time belongs to temporality itself, in the s trict sense of the exis­
tential and temporal concept of world. We wish to understand how that
is possible and why it is necessary. Thus we can throw light on the vul­
garly familiar "time" "in which" beings occur, as well as the within-time­
ness of these beings.
Everyday Da-sein taking time initially finds time in things at hand
and objectively present encountered within the world. It understands
time thus " experienced" in the horizon of the understanding of being
that is neares t to it, that is, as something that is itself somehow obj ec­
tively present. We must clarify how and why the development of the
vulgar c o n c e p t o f time c o m e s ab o u t i n terms of the tempo rally
grounded constitution of being of Da-sein taking care of time . The vul­
gar concept of time owes its provenance to a levelling down of primor­
dial time. By demonstrating that this is the source of the vulgar con­
cept of time, we shall justify our earlier interpretation of temporality as

primordial time.
In the development of the vulgar concept of time, there is a remark­
able vacillation as to whether a " subjective" or an "objective" character
should be attributed to time. When one conceives it as being in itself, it is
attributed primarily to the "soul. " And when it has the character o f
"belonging t o consciousness," it still functions "objectively. " I n Hegel's
interpretation of time both possibilities are in a way elevated to a higher
unity. Hegel attempts to determine the connection between " time" and
" spirit" in order to make it intelligible why spirit, as history, "falls into
time." In its

results,

the foregoing interpretation of the temporality of

Da-sein and the way world time belongs to it seems to agree with Hegel.
But since our analysis of time is already distinguished from the outset in
principle from that of Hegel, and since its orientation is precisely the

opposite of his

in that it aims at fundamental ontology, a short presenta­

tion of Hegel's interpretation of the relation between time and spirit
can help to clarify indirectly our existential and ontological interpretation

II. VI

Being and Time

373

of the temporality of Da-sein, world time, and the origin of the vulgar
concept of time and may conclude our discussion for now.
The question as to whether and how time has any "being," why and
in what sense we designate it as "being," cannot be answered until we
have shown how temporality itself makes possible something like an
understanding of being and addressing of beings in the whole of its
temporalizing. Our chapter will be diyided as follows: The temporality of

79. The Temporality of Da-sein and Taking Care of Time
Da-sein exists as a being that, in its being, is concerned

about

that being

itself. Essentially ahead of itself, it has projected itself upon its poten­
tiality-of-being

before going on to any mere consideration of itself.

In its

project it is revealed as something thrown. Thrown and abandoned to
the world, it falls prey to it in taking care of it. As care, that is, as existing
in the unity of the entangled, thrown project, this being is disclosed as a
There . Being-together-with others, it keeps itself in an average inter­
pretedness that is articulated in discourse and expressed in language.

addressing and talking over what is taken care of. The circumspect tak­
ing care of common sense is grounded in temporality, in the mode of
making present that awaits and retains. As taking care in calculating,
planning, preparing ahead, and preventing, it always already says,
whether audibly or not: " then" . . . that will happen,

failed or eluded us.
In the "then," taking care expresses itself in awaiting; retaining in

the "on that former occasion" and making present in the "now." In the
"then"-but for the most part inexplicitly-lies the "now not yet," that is,
it is spoken in a making present that awaitingly retains or forgets. The
"on that former occasion" contains the "now no longer." With it, retain­
ing expresses itself as a making present that awaits. The " then" and the
"on that former occasion" are understood with regard to a "now," that
is, making present has a peculiar weight. Indeed, it always temporalizes
itself in a unity with awaiting and retaining, even if these are modified

374

II. VI

Being and Time

into a forgetting that does not await. In this mode of forgetting, tem­
porality gets caught in the present that primarily says "now-now" in
m aking present. What taking care awaits as what is nearest to it, is
addressed in the "right away"; what has been made initially available or
l o s t is addres s e d in the ·� ust now . " The horizon of retaining that
expresses itself in the "on that former occasion" is the
zon for the " then" is the
"now" is the

"later on"

"earlier,"

the hori­

( "in the future"), the horizon for the

"today."

But every "then" i s as such a "then, when . . . "; every "on that former
occasion" is an " on that former occasion when . . . "; every "now" is a
"now that . . . ". We shall call this seemingly self-evident relational structure
of the "now," "on that former occasion," and "then"

datability.

We com­

pletely leave aside the question whether this datability is factically carried
out with regard to a "date" on the calendar. Even without such "dates," the
"now" and "then" and "on that former occasion" are more or less dated in
a definite way. If the dating is not made more definite, that does not
mean that the structure of datability is lacking or is a matter of chance.

What is that to which such datability essentially belongs and what is data­
bility based upon? But can a more superfluous question be raised than
this one? With the "now that . . . ", we mean, after

all,

a "point in time,"

" as one knows . " The "now" is time. Undeniably we understand the
"now . . . that," "then . . . when," "on that former occasion . . . when" in a
way as also being connected with "time." That all this means "time" itself,
how that is possible, and what "time" signifies-these are matters of which
we have no conception in our "natural" understanding of the "now" and
so on. Is it then self-evident that we "right away understand" and "natu­
rally" express something like "now," " then," and "on that former occa­
sion"? Where do we get this "now . . . that . . . ?" Did we find something
like this among innerworldly beings, among those that are objectively
present? Obviously not. Have we found it at all? Have we ever started to
look for it and ascertain it? It is "always" available to us without our ever
having explicitly taken it over, and we make constant use of it, although
not always in verbal expression. Even in the most trivial, offhand kind of
everyday talk (for example, "it is cold") we also have in mind a "now
that . . . ". Why does Da-sein express a "now that . . . ", " then when . . . " ,
" on that former occasion when . . . " i n addressing what it takes care of,
although mostly without verbalizing it? First, because in addressing itself
to something interpretively, it expresses

408

itself too;

that is, it expresses its

circumspect and understanding being-together-with things at hand that lets
them be discovered and encountered. And secondly because this address­
ing and discussing that also interprets

prets itself, that is, what has been interpreted and addressed in the
"now," is what we call "time. " What is made known in this is simply that
temporality, recognizable as ecstatically open, is initially and for the
most part known only in this interpretedness that takes care. But while
time is "immediately" intelligible and recognizable, this does not, how­
ever, preclude the possibility that primordial temporality as such, as
well as the origin temporalizing itself in it of expressed time, may remain
unknown and unconceived.
The fact that the s tructure of datability belongs essentially to
what is interpreted with the "now, " " then," and "on that former occa­
sion , " becomes the most elemental proof that what has been inter­
preted originates from temporality interpreting itself. Saying "now, "

" now," " then, " and "on that former occasion" is evidence for the fact
that they

stem from temporality and are themselves time.

The interpretive

expression of " now, " " then, " and "on that former occasion" is the
most primordial* way of giving

the time.

In the

ecstatic unity of tempo­

rality that is understood along with datability, but unthematically and
unrecognizable as such, Da-sein has always already been disclosed to
i ts elf as being-in-the-world, and innerworldly beings have been discov­
ered along with it; because of this, interpreted time has always already
been given a dating in terms of the beings encountered in the dis­
closedness of the There; now that . . . the door slams; now that . . . my

Because they have the same origin from

ecstatic

temporality, the

horizons that belong to the "now, " " then," and "on that former occasion" also have the character of datability as "today when . . . ," "later on
when . . . , " and "earlier when . . . ".

II.VI

Being and Time

If awaiting, understanding itself in the "then," interprets itself and
in so doing, as a making present, understands what it is awaiting in terms
of its "now," the "and now not yet" already lies in the "giving" of the
"then." The awaiting that makes present understands the "until then."
Interpretation articulates this "until then"-namely, "it has its time"-as
the

in-between

that also has a relation of datability. This relation is

expressed in the "meanwhile." Taking care can again articulate in await­
ing the "during" itself by giving further "thens." The "until then" is sub­
divided by a number of "from then . . . until thens" that, however, have
been "embraced" beforeh3Ild in the awaiting project of the primary
"then." The "lasting" is articulated in the understanding of the "during"
that awaits and makes present. This duration is again the time revealed in
the self-interpretation of temporality, a time that is thus actually, but
unthematically, understood in taking care as a "span." The making pre­
sent that awaits and retains interprets a "during" with a "span," only
because in so doing it is disclosed to

along

itself as

being ecstatically

stretched

in historical temporality, even though it does not know itself as

this. But here a further peculiarity of the time "given" shows itself. Not
only does the "during" have a span, but every "now," "then," and "on that
former occasion" is always spanned with the structure of datability, with
a changing span: "now" in the intermission, at dinner, in the evening, in
summer; "then" at breakfast, while climbing, and so on.
The taking care that awaits, retains, and makes present, "allows
itself' time

in

this or that way and gives this time to itself in taking care,

even without determining the time by any specific reckoning, and before
any such reckoning has been done. Here time dates itself in one's actual
mode of allowing oneself time heedfully in terms of what is actually dis­
closed in what is taken care of in the surrounding world and in attuned
understanding, in terms of what one does "all day long." The more Da­
sein is absorbed in awaiting what is taken care of and, not awaiting
itself, forgets itself, the more its time that it "allows" itself is

covered over

by this mode of "allowing." In the everyday " living along" that takes
care, Da-sein never understands itself as running along in a continu­
ously enduring succession of pure "nows." By reason of this covering
over, the time that Da-sein allows itself has gaps in it, so to speak. We
often cannot bring a "day" together again when we come back to the

410

time that we have "used." Yet the time that has gaps in it does not go to
pieces in this lack of togetherness, but is a mode of temporality that is
always already disclosed and ecstatically

stretched along.

The mode in

which the time "all owed" "elapses," and the way in which taking care
gives that time to itself more or less explicitly, can be phenomenally
explicated appropriately only if, on the one hand, we avoid the theoret­
ical "representation" of a continuous stream of nows, and if, on the

II. VI

Being and Time

377

other hand, the possible modes in which Da-sein gives and allows itself
time are to be conceived of as primarily determined in terms of how it
"has " its time in a manner corresponding to its actual existence.
In an earlier passage, authentic and inauthentic existing were char­
acterized with regard to the modes of the temporalizing of temporality
upon which such existing is founded. Accordingly, the irresoluteness of
inauthentic existence temporalizes itself in the mode of a making present
that does not await but forgets. The irresolute person understands himself
in terms of the events and accidents nearest by that are encountered in
such making present and urge themselves upon him in changing ways.
Busily losing himself in what is taken care of, the irresolute person loses his
time in them, too. Hence his characteristic way of talking: "I have no time."
Just as the person who exists inauthentically constantly loses time and
never "has" any, it is the distinction of the temporality of authentic exis­
tence that in resoluteness it never loses time and "always has time." For the
temporality of resoluteness has, in regard to its present, the nature of the
Moment. The Moment's authentic making present of the situation does
not itself have the leadership, but is held in the future that has-been. The
existence of the Moment temporalizes itself as fatefully whole, stretching
along in the sense of the authentic, historical constancy of the self. This
kind of temporal existence "constantly" has its time for what the situation
requires of it. But resoluteness discloses the There in such a way only as sit­
uation. Thus the resolute person can never encounter what is disclosed in
such a way that he could lose his time on it in an irresolute way.
Factically thrown Da-sein can "take " and lose time for itself only because
a "time " is allotted to it as temporality ecstatically stretched along with the dis­
closedness of the There grounded in that temporality.
As disclosed, Da-sein exists factically in the mode of being-with with
the others. It keeps itself in a public, average intelligibility. The "now
that . . . ", "then when . . . " interpreted and expressed in everyday being­
with-one-another, are unders tood in principle, although they are
unequivocally dated only within limits. In the "nearest" being-with-one­
another, several people can say "now" together, and each can date the
"now" in a different way: now that this or that happens . The "now"
expressed is spoken by each one in the publicness of being-with-one­
another-in-the-world. The time interpreted and expressed by actual Dasein is thus also always already made public as such on the basis of its
ecstatic being-in-the-world. Since everyday taking care understands itself
in terms of the "world" taken care of, it knows the "time" that it takes for
itself not as its own, but rather heedfully exploits the time that "there is,"
the time with which the they reckons. But the publicness of "time" is all
the more compelling, the more factical Da-sein explicitly takes care of
time by expressly taking it into account.

II. VI

Being and Time
80. Time Taken Care of and Within-Timeness

Thus far we have only had to understand how Da-sein, grounded in
temporality, takes care of time in existing, and how time makes itself
public for being-in-the-world in the taking care that interprets. We did
not determine at all in what sense the public time expressed
whether it can be addressed as

being

"is,"

or

at all . Before any decision as to

whether public time "is merely subjective" or whether it is "objectively
real," or neither of the two, the phenomenal character of public time
must first be determined more precisely.
Making time public does not occur occasionally and subsequently.
Rather, since Da-sein

is always

already disclosed as ecstatic and temporal

and because understanding and interpretation belong to existence, time
has also already made itself public in taking care. One orients oneself

toward it,

so that it must somehow be available for everyone.

Although taking care of time can be carri e d out in the mode of
dating that we characterized-namely, in terms of events in the sur­
rounding world-this always occurs basically in the horizon of a taking
care of time that we know as astronomical and calendrical time-reckoning.
This reckoning is not a matter of chance, but has its existential and
ontological necessity in the fundamental constitution of Da-sein as care.
Since Da-sein essentially exists entangled as thrown, it interprets its time

412

heedfully by way of a reckoning with time. In this reckoning, the "real"
making public o f time temporalizes itself s o that w e must say that the
thrownness of Da-sein is the reason why "there is " public time. If we are to
demonstrate that public time has its origin in factical temporality and if
we are to assure ourselves that this demonstration is as intelligible as pos­
sible, we must characterize beforehand the time interpreted in general in
the temporality of taking care, if only to make clear that the essence of
taking care of time does

not

lie in the application of numerical proce­

dures in dating. What is existentially and ontologically decisive about

reckoning with

time must not be seen in the quantification of time, but

must be more primordially conceived in terms of the temporality of
Da-sein reckoning with time.
"Public time" turns out to be

the

time "in which" innerworldly

things at hand and objectively present are encountered. This requires
that we call these beings unlike Da-sein beings

within-time.

The inter­

pretation of within-timeness gives us a more primordial insight into the
essence of "public time" and at the same time makes it possible to define
its "being. "
The being of Da-sein is care. This being exists entangled as thrown.
Delivered over to the "world" discovered with its factical There and
dependent upon it in taking care, Da-sein awaits its potentiality-of-being-

II.VI

Being and Time

379

in-the-world in such a way that it reckons with and on whatever is in
eminent relevance for the sake of its potentiality-of-being. Everyday, cir·
cumspect being-in-the-world needs the possibility of sight, that is, brightness,
if it is to take care of things at hand within what is objectively present.
With the factical disclosedness of world, nature has been discovered
for Da-sein. In its thrownness Da-sein is subject to the changes of day
and night. Day with its brightness gives it the possibility of sight, night
takes it away.
Awaiting the possibility of sight while circumspectly taking care,
Da-sein, understanding itself in terms of its daily work, gives itself its
time with the "then when it dawns." The "then" taken care of is dated in
terms of what is in the nearest context of relevance of the surrounding
world, with getting light, the sunrise. Then, when the sun rises, it is time
for . . Thus Da-sein dates the time that it must take for itself in terms of
what is encountered within the world and in the horizon of being deliv­
ered over to the world as something for which there is an eminent rele­
vance for the circumspect potentiality-of-being-in-the-world. Taking care
makes use of the "handiness" of the sun giving forth light and warmth.
The sun dates the time interpreted in taking care. From this dating
arises the "most natural" measure o f time, the day. And since the tem­
porality of Da-sein that must take its time is finite, its days are also
already numbered. "While it is day" gives to awaiting that takes care
the possibility of determining in a precautionary way the "thens" of
what is to be taken care of, that is, of dividing up the day. The dividing
up in its tum is carried out with regard to what dates time, the moving
sun. like sunrise, sunset and noon are distinctive "places" that this heavenly body occupies. Da-sein, thrown into the world, temporalizing, and
giving itself time, takes account of its regular recurring passage. The
occurrence of Da-sein is a daily one by reason of interpreting time by dating it-a way that is prefigured in its thrownness into the There.
This dating of things in terms of the heavenly body giving forth
light and warmth, and in terms of its distinctive "places" in the sky, is a
way of giving time which can be done in our being-with-one-another
"under the same sky, " and which can be done for "everyone" at any
time in the same way so that within certain limits everyone is initially
agreed upon it. That which dates is available in the surrounding world
and yet not restricted to the actual world of useful things taken care
of. Rather, in that world, nature in the surrounding world and the pub­
lic surrounding world are always discovered along with it.2 At the same
time everyone can "count on" this public dating in which everyone gives
himself his time. It makes use of a measure that is available to the public.
This dating reckons with time in the sense of time measurement that needs
something to measure time, that is, a clock. This means that with the tem.

Being and Time

porality of Da-sein as thrown, delivered over to the world, and giving itself
time, something like a "clock" is also discovered, that is, a handy thing that has
become accessible in its regular recurrence in a making present that awaits.
Thrown being-together-with things at hand is grounded in temporality.
Temporality is the reason for the clock. As the condition of the possi­
bility of the factical necessity of the clock, temporality is at the same
time the condition for its discoverability. For while the course of the sun
is encountered along with the discoveredness of innerworldly beings, it
is only by making it present in awaitingly retaining, and by doing so in a
way that interprets itself, that dating in terms of things at hand in the
public surrounding world is made possible and is also required.
The "natural" clock, which is always already discovered with the
factical thrownness of Da-sein grounded in temporality, first motivates

414

and at the s ame time makes possible the production and use of s till
more handy clocks. It does this in such a way that these "artificial" clocks
must be "adjusted" to the "natural" one if they are to make the time pri­
marily discovered in the natural clock accessible in its tum.
Before we characterize the main traits in the development of reck­
oning with time and the use of clocks in their existential and ontological
meaning, we first want to characterize more completely the time taken
care of in the measurement of time. If the time we take care of is "really"
made public only when it gets measured, then public time is to be acces­
s ible in a way that has been phenomenally unveiled. We must have
access to it by following up the way that which has been dated shows
itself when dated in this "reckoning" way.
When the " then" that interprets itself in heedful awaiting gets
dated, this dating includes some such s tatement as: then-when i t
dawns-it i s

timef or the day's work. The time interpreted in taking care is

always already understood as time for . . . . The actual "now that so and
so" is as

such

either

appropriate

or

inappropriate.

The "now"-and thus

every mode of interpreted time-is not only a " now that . . . " that is
essentially datable, but is at the same time essentially determined by
the structure of appropriateness or inappropriateness. Interpreted time
has by its very nature the character of " time for . . . " or "not the time
for . . . ". The making present that awaits and retains of taking care
understands time in its relation to a what-for, that is in tum ultimately
anchored in a for-the-sake-of-which of the potentiality-of-being of Da­
sein. With this relation of in-order-to, time made public reveals
ture that we got to know earlier' as

381
in the

sense interpreted existentially and ontologically . How the essential rela­
tions of the world structure (for example, the

"in-order-to") are connected

with public time (for example, the " then-when") on the basis of the
ecstatic and horizonal constitution of temporality will be shown in what
follows. At any rate, only now can time taken care of be completely
characterized as to its structure: It is datable, spanned, and public and, as
having this s tructure, it belongs to the world itself. Every "now, " for
example, that is expressed in a natural, everyday way, has this structure
and is understood as such when Da-sein allows itself time in taking care,
although unthematically and preconceptually.
The disclosedness of the natural clock belongs to Da-sein that exists
as thrown and entangled, and in this disclosedness factical Da-sein has at
the same time already brought about an eminent making public of the
time taken care of. This making public is enhanced and strengthened as
time reckoning is perfected and the use of the clock becomes more
refmed. The historical development of time reckoning and the use of the
clock is not to be presented here historiographically with all its possible
variations. Rather, we want to ask existentially and ontologically what
mode of temporalizing of the temporality of Da-sein is made manifest in
developing the

direction

of reckoning with time and the use of the clock.

The answer to this question must further a more primordial understand­
ing of the fact that time measurem ent that is, at the same time the explicit
-

making public of time taken care of-is grounded

in the temporality

of Da­

sein and indeed in a quite definite temporalizing of that temporality.
If we compare "primitive" Da-sein, which we used as the basis for
the analysis of "natural" time-reckoning, with more "advanced" Da-sein,
we find that for more advanced Da-sein day and the presence of sunlight
no longer possess an eminent function, because this Da-sein has the
"advantage" of even being able to turn the night into day. Similarly, we
no longer need to glance explicitly and directly at the sun and its posi­
tion to ascertain the time. The manufacture and use of one's own mea­
suring instruments permits us to read off the time directly by clocks
explicitly produced for this purpose. The what o'clock is it?, is the "what
time is it?" Because the clock-in the sense of what makes possible a
public reckoning of time-must be regulated by the "natural" clock,
even the use of clocks is grounded in the temporality of Da-sein that,
with the disclosedness of the There, first makes possible a dating of the
time taken care of. This is a fact, even if it is covered over when the
time is read off. Our understanding of the

natural

clock that develops

with the progressive discovery of nature directs us to new possibilities for
time measurement that are relatively independent of the day and of
any explicit observation of the sky.

415

382

II.VI

Being and Time

But in a way even "primitive" Da-sein makes itself independent of
reading off the time directly from the sky, since it does not ascertain the
position of the sun in the sky, but measures the shadow cast by some

416

being available at any time. That can happen at first in the most simple
form of the ancient "peasant's clock." In the shadow that constantly
accompanies everyone, we encounter the sun with respect to its chang­
ing presence at different places. The various lengths of the shadow dur­
ing the day can be paced off "at any time." Even if the lengths of the
individual' s body and feet are different, still the

relation

of the two

remain constant within certain limits. Thus, for example, when one
takes care of making an appointment, one designates the time publicly
by saying: "When the shadow is so many feet long, we will meet each
other there." Here in being-with-one-another in the more narrow limits
of a surrounding world nearest to us, we tacitly presuppose that the
"locations" at which the shadow is paced off are at the same latitude. Da­
sein does not even need to wear this clock, it is it in a way itself.
The public sundial, in which the line of a shadow is counterposed
to the course of the sun and moves along a graduated dial needs no fur­
ther description. But why do we fmd something like time at the position
that the shadow occupies on the dial? Neither the shadow nor the grad­
uated dial is time itself, nor is the spatial relation between them. Where,
then, is the time that we read off directly not only on the "sundial" but
also on every pocketwatch?
What does reading off the time signify? "To look at the clock"
cannot simply mean to contemplate the tool at hand in its changes and
to follow the positions of the pointer. Ascertaining what time it is in
using the clock,

we say, whether explicitly or not, now it is such an hour
now it is time to . .. , or there is still time ... ,

and so many minutes,
namely
a

now until .... Looking at the clock is grounded in and guided by

taking-time-for-oneself. What already showed itself in the most ele­

mental reckoning of time becomes more clear here: Looking at the
clock and orienting oneself

toward time is

now-saying. Here
interpreted in its complete

essentially a

the now is always already understood and

structural content of datability, spannedness, publicness, and worldli­
ness. This is so "obvious" that we do not take any notice of it at all; still
less do we know anything about it explicitly.
But now-saying is the discoursing articulation of a
that temporalizes itself in unity with

an

making present

awaiting that retains. The dating

carried out in the use of the clock tums out to be the eminent making
present of something objectively present. Dating does not simply take up

417

a relation with something objectively present, but taking up a relation
itself has the character of

measuring.

Of course, the number of the mea­

surement can be read off directly. However, this means that when a

II. VI

Being and Time

383

length is to be measured, we understand that our standard is con­
tained in it, that is, we determine the frequency of its presence in that
length. Measuring is constituted temporally when a present standard is
made present in a present length. The idea of a standard implies
unchangingness; this means that it must be objectively present in its
constancy at every time for everyone. When the time taken care of is
dated by measuring, one interprets that time by looking at something
objectively present and making it present-something that would not
become accessible as a standard or as something measured except by
our eminent making present. Since the making present of what is pre­
sent has special priority in the dating that measures, when one mea­
sures and reads off the time by the clock, one also expresses the now
with special emphasis. Thus in measuring time, time gets made public in
such a way that it is encountered in each case and at each time for
everyone as "now and now and now." This time "universally " accessible
in clocks is found as an objectively present multiplicity of nows, so to
speak, though time measurement is not directed thematically toward
time as such.
The temporality of factical being-in-the-world is what primordially
makes the disclosure of space possible; and spatial Da-sein has always
been referred to a here of the character of Da-sein out of an over there
that has been discovered. Because of all this, the time taken care of in
the temporality of Da-sein is always bound up with some location of
Da-sein with regard to its datability. It is not that time is connected to a
location, but rather temporality is the condition of the possibility that
dating may be bound up with the spatially-local in such a way that the lat­
ter is binding for everyone as a measure. Time is not first coupled with
space, but the "space" that is supposedly to be coupled with it is encoun­
tered only on the basis of temporality taking care of time. Inasmuch as
both the clock and time-reckoning are grounded in the temporality of Da­
sein, which constitutes this being as historical, we can show ontologically
how the use of the clock is itself historical and how every clock as such
"has a history. "4
The time made public in our measurement of it by no means turns
into space because we date it in terms of spatial relations of measure­
ment. Nor is what is existentially and ontologically essential in time mea·
surement to be sought in the fact that dated "time" is determined numer­
ically in terms of spatial distances and changes in the location of some
spatial thing. Rather, what is ontologically decisive lies in the specific
making present that makes measurement possible. Dating in terms of
what is objectively present "spatially" is so far from a spatialization of
time that this supposed spatialization signifies nothing other than that a
being that is objectively present for everyone in every now is made pre-

sent in its own presence. Measuring time is essentially such that it is
necessary to say now, but in obtaining the measurement we, as it were,
forget what has been measured as such so that nothing is to be found
except distance and number.
The less time Da-sein has to lose while taking care of time, the
more "precious" time becomes and the more

handy

the dock must be.

Not only must time be able to be given "more precisely," but the deter­
mination of time itself should require the least time possible, though it
must still be in conformity with the time given by the others.
Preliminarily, we only wanted to point out the general "connec­
tion" of the use of the dock with temporality that takes time for itself.
Just as the concrete analysis of the astronomical time-reckoning in its full
development belongs to the existential and ontological interpretation of
the discovery of nature, the foundations of calendrical and historio­
graphical "chronology" can also be set forth only in the scope of tasks of
an existential analysis of historiographical cognition.5

419

The measurement of time brings about a making public of time, so
that only in this way does what we usually call "time" become familiar. In
taking care, "its time" is attributed to every thing. It "has" it, and like
every innerworldly being, it can "have" it only because it is "in time" in
general. The time "in which" innerworldly beings are encountered we
know as world time. On the basis of the ecstatic and horizonal constitu­
tion of temporality to which it belongs, world time has

the same

tran­

scendence as the world. With the disdosedness of world, world time is
made public, so that every being-together-with

innerworldly beings

that

temporally takes care understands those beings as circumspectly encoun­
tered "in time."
The time "in which" objectively present things move or are at rest
is not

"objective,"

if by this is meant the objective presence in itself of

beings encountered in the world. But time is not

"subjective" either, if we

understand by that the objective presence and occurrence in a "sub­

World time is more "objective" than any possible object because, with the
disclosedness of the world, it always already becomes ecstatically and horizonally
"objectified" as the condition of the possibility ofinnerworldly beings. Thus, con­
trary to Kant's opinion, world time is found just as directly in what is

ject."

physical as in what is psychical, and not just by way of a detour over the
psychical. Initially "time" shows itself in the sky, that is, precisely where
one finds it in the natural orientation

toward it,

so that "time" is even

identified with the sky.

But world time is also "more subjective" than any possible subject since it
first makes possible the being of the factical existing self, that being which, as is
now well understood, is the meaning of care. "Time" is neither objectively pre­
sent in the "subject" nor in the "object," neither "inside" nor "outside,"

II. VI

Being and Time

and it "is"

"prior" to every subjectivity and objectivity,

385

because it presents

the condition of the very possibility of this "prior." Does it then have
any "being" at all? And if not, is it then a phantom or is it "more in
being" than any possible being? Any investigation that goes further in the
direction of these questions will bump into the same "limit" that already

420

posed itself for our provisional discussion of the connection between
truth and being.6 However these questions are to be answered in what follows, or are to be asked primordially, we must first understand that tem­
porality, as ecstatic and horizonal, first temporalizes something like

world

time that constitutes a within-timeness of things at hand and objectively
present. But then these beings can never be called "temporal" in the
strict sense. Like every being unlike Da-sein, they are atemporal, whether
they occur, arise, and pass away realistically, or subsist "ideally."
If world time thus belongs to the temporalizing of temporality, it
can neither be volatized "subjectivistically" nor be "reified" in a bad
"objectification." These two possibilities can be avoided with clear
insight-not just by vacillating insecurely between them-only if we
understand how everyday Da-sein theoretically conceives "time" in terms
of its nearest understanding of time, and only if we understand how
this concept of time and its dominance blocks the possibility of under­
standing what it means in terms of primordial time, that is, as

temporality.

Everyday taking care that gives itself time finds "time" in innerworldly
beings that are encountered "in time." Thus our illumination of the
genesis of the vulgar concept of time must take its point of departure
from within-timeness.

81. Within-Timeness and the Genesis of the Vulgar Concept of Time
How does something like "time" initially show itself for everyday, cir­
cumspect taking care? In what mode of taking care and using tools does
it become explicitly accessible? If time has been made public with the dis­
closedness of world, if it has always already been taken care of with the
discoveredness of innerworldly beings belonging to the disclosedness of
world since Da-sein calculates time reckoning with

itself, then the mode
toward time lies in

of behavior in which "one" orients oneself explicitly

the use of the clock. The existential and temporal meaning of the clock
turns out to be making present of the moving pointer. By
positions of the pointer in a way that makes present, one

following the
counts them.

This making present temporalizes itself in the ecstatic unity of a retaining that awaits. To

retain the "on that former occasion"

in

making present

means that in saying-now to be open for the horizon of the earlier, that
is, the now-no-longer. To

await the "then" in making present means that in

saying-now to be open for the horizon of the later, that is, the now-not-

421

386

Being and Time

yet.

What shows itself in this. making present is time. Then how are we to
time manifest in the horizon of the use of the clock that is cir­
cumspect and takes time for itself in taking care? This time is what is
counted, showing itself in following. making present, and counting the moving
pointer in such a way that making present temporalizes itself in ecstatic unity
with retaining and awaiting horizonally open according to the earlier and
later. But that is nothing more than an existential and ontological inter­
pretation of the definition that Aristotle gave of time: touto gar estin ho
chronos, arithmos kineseos kata to proteron kai hysteron. "That, namely, is
defme the

time, what is counted in the motion encountered in the horizon of the
earlier and the later."' As strange as this definition may appear at first
glance, it is "self-evident" and genuinely drawn if the existential and
ontological horizon is defined from which Aristotle took it. The origin of
time thus revealed is not a problem for Aristotle. His interpretation of
time rather moves in the direction of the "natural" understanding of
being. However, since that understanding and the being understood in
it have been made a problem in principle in our present inquiry, the
Aristotelian analysis of time can be thematically interpreted only

after the

solution to the question of being, and indeed in such a way that that
analysis gains a fundamental significance for a positive appropriation of
the critically limited line of questioning of ancient ontology in general.8

All subsequent discussion of the concept of time in principle keeps
to the Aristotelian definition, that is, it makes time thematic in the way that
it shows itself in circumspect taking care. Time is "what is counted," that is,
it is what is expressed and what is meant, although unthematically , in the
making present of the

moving pointer

(or shadow). In making present

what is moved in its motion, one says "now here, now here, and so on."
What is counted are the nows. And they show themselves "in every now"
as "right-away-no-longer-now" and 'just-now-not-yet." The world time
"caught sight of' in this way in the use of the clock we shall call

422

now-time.

The more "naturall y" the taking care of time that gives itself time
reckons with time, the less it dwells together with the expressed time as
such. Rather, it is lost

in the useful things taken care of that always have

their time. When taking care determines time and gives it, the more
"naturally" it does so-that is, the less it is directed toward treating time
as such thematically-all the more does the being-together-with what is
taken care of (the being-together making present and falling prey)say
unhesitatingly (whether with or without utterance): now, then, on that
former occasion. And thus time shows itself for the vulgar understand­
ing as a succession of constantly "objectively present" nows that pass
away and arrive at the same time. Time is understood as a sequence, as
the "flux" of nows, as the "course of time."

pretation of world time taken care oft

What is implied by this inter­

II. VI

Being and Time
We can answer this if we go back to the

387

complete essential structure

of world time and compare this with that with which the vulgar under­
standing of time is familiar. We set forth

datability as

the first essential

factor of time taken care of. It is grounded in the ecstatic constitution of
temporality. The "now" is essentially a now-that .... The datable now
that is understood in taking care, although not grasped as such, is always
appropriate or inappropriate.

Signifzcance

belongs to the now-structure.

Thus we called time taken care of world time. In the vulgar interpretation
of time as a succession of nows, both datability and significance are lack­
ing. The characterization of time as pure sequence does not let these two
structures "appear." The vulgar interpretation of time covers them over.
The ecstatic and horizonal constitution of temporality, in which the
datability and significance of the now are grounded, is

levelled down

by

this covering over. The nows are cut off from these relations, so to
speak, and, as thus cut off, they simply range themselves along after
one another so as to constitute the succession.
This covering over and levelling down of world time that is carried
out by the vulgar understanding of time is no accident. Rather, pre­
cisely because the everyday interpretation of time keeps itself solely in the
perspective of commonsense taking care, and understands only what
"shows" itself in the commonsense horizon, these structures have to
escape it. What is counted in the measurement of time taken care of, the
now, is also understood in taking care of things at hand and objectively
present. Since

this taking care of time comes back to

the time itself that

has also been understood and "contemplates" it, it sees the nows (that
are also somehow "there") in the horizon of

the understanding of being
nows are thus
also in a way objectively present, that is, beings are encountered and also the

by which this taking care is itself constantly guided.9 The

now. Although it is not explicitly stated that the nows are objectively present like things, still they are "seen" ontologically in the horizon of the
idea of objective presence. The nows

pass away,

and the past ones con-

stitute the past. The nows arrive, and the future ones define the "future."
The vulgar interpretation of world time as now-time does not have the
horizon available at all by which such things as world, significance, and
datability can be made more accessible. These structures remain necessarily covered over,

all the more so since the vulgar interpretation of

time enforces this covering over by the way in which it conceptually
develops its characterization of time.
The succession of nows is interpreted as something somehow
objectively present; for it itself moves "in time." We say that in every now
it is now,

in

every now it already disappears. The now is now in every

now, thus constantly present as the

same,

even if in every now another

may be disappearing as it arrives. Yet it does show at the same time the

423

II. VI

Being and Time

388

constant presence of itself as

this

changing thing. Thus even Plato, who

had this perspective of time as a succession of nows that come into
being and pass away, had to call time the image of eternity:

eiko d' epenoei
kineton tina aionos poiesai, kai diakosmon kama ouranon poiei menontos
aianos en heni kat' arithmon iousan aionion eikona, touton hon de kronon
onomakamen.10
The succession of nows is uninterrupted and has no gaps. No mat­
ter how "far" we penetrate in "dividing" the now, it is still always now.
One regards the continuity of time in the horizon of something indis­
solubly objectively present. Ontologically oriented toward something
constantly objectively present, one either looks for the problem of the
continuity of time, or one leaves the
structure of world time must remain

aporia alone. Here the specific
covered over, since it is spanned

together with ecstatically founded datability. The spannedness of time is
not understood in terms of the horizontal

being stretched along

of the

ecstatic unity of temporality that has made itself public in taking care of
time. The fact that it is

always already now in every

now, no matter how

momentary, must be conceived in terms of what is
from which every now arises:

424

still

"earlier" and

in terms of the ecstatically being stretched

along of the temporality that is foreign to any continuity of something
objectively present, but that in tum presents the condition of the possi­
bility of the access to something continuous and objectively present.
The main thesis of the vulgar interpretation of time-that time is
"infinite"-reveals most penetratingly the levelling down and covering
over of world time and thus of temporality in general in this interpreta­
tion. Initially, time gives itself as an uninterrupted succession of nows.
Every now is already either a just now or a right-away. If the characteri­
zation of time keeps primarily and exclusively to

this succession,

no begin­

ning and no end can be found in principle in it as such. Every last now,

a now,

is always

as

already a right-away that is no longer, thus it is time in the

sense of the no-longer-now, of the past. Every first now is always a just­
now-not-yet, thus it is time in the sense of the not-yet-now, the "future."
Time is thus endless "in both directions." This thesis about time is possi­
ble only on the basis of an orientation

toward an unattached in-itself of a
course of nows objectively present, whereby the complete phenomenon of the
now is covered over with regard to the datability, worldliness, spanned­
ness, and publicness of Da-sein, so that it has dwindled to an unrecog­
nizable fragment. If "one thinks" the succession of nows "to the end"
with the perspective of objective presence or the lack of it, an end can
never be found. In
always

this way of thinking time through to the end, one must
think more time; from this one concludes that time is endless.

But in what is this levelling down of world time and covering over
of temporality grounded? In the being of Da-sein itself that we inter-

II. VI

Being and Time

preted as

care in a preparatory

389

way.11 Thrown and entangled, Da-sein is

initially and for the most part lost in what it takes care of. But in this lost­
ness, the flight of Da-sein from its authentic existence that we charac­
terized as anticipatory resoluteness makes itself known, and this is a
flight that covers over. In such heedful fleeing lies the flight from death,
that is, a looking away from the end of being-in-the-world!2 This looking
away from . . . is in itself a mode of the ecstatic,JUtural being

toward the

end. Looking away from finitude, the inauthentic temporality of entan­
gled everyday Da-sein must fail to recognize authentic futurality and
thus temporality in general. And if the vulgar understanding of Da-sein
is guided by the they, then the self-forgetful "representation" of the
"infinitude" of public time can first anchor itself. The they never dies
because it is

unable

to die, since death is always my own and is under-

stood authentically only in anticipatory resoluteness in an existentiell
way. The they, which never dies and misunderstands being-toward-theend, nonetheless interprets the flight from death in a characteristic way.
Up to the end "it always has more time." Here a way of having time
makes itself known in the sense of being able to lose it: "right now this,
then that . . . ". Here it is not as if the finitude of time were understood,
but quite the opposite. Taking care is out to snatch as much as possible
from time that is still coming and "goes on." Publically, time is something that everyone can and does take. The levelled-down succession
of nows remains completely unrecognizable with regard to its provenance from the temporality of individual Da-sein in everyday being-with­
one-another. How should that affect "time" in its course even in the
least if a human being objectively present "in time" no longer exists?
Time goes on as it already "was," after all, when a human being "entered
life." One knows only public time that, levelled down, belongs to everyone, and that means to no one.
However, just as one who flees death is pursued by it even as one
evades it, and just as in turning away from it one has to see it nonethe­
less, the harmless endless succession of nows that just runs on imposes
itself "on" Da-sein in a remarkably enigmatic way. Why do we say that
time

passes away

when we do not emphasize just

as

much

how it comes

into being? With regard to the pure succession of nows, both could,
after all , be said with equal justification. In talking about time's

away,

passing

Da-sein ultimately understands more about time than it would

like to admit, that is, the
itself is

temporality in which world time temporalizes
not completely closed off despite all covering over. Talking about

time's passing away gives expression to the "experience" that time can­
not be halted. This "experience" is again possible only on the basis of
wanting to halt time. Herein lies an inauthentic

awaiting

of "moments"

that already forgets the moments as they slip by. The awaiting of inau-

425

390

II. VI

Being and Time

thentic existence that makes present and forgets is the condition of the
possibility of the vulgar experience of time's passing away. Since Da­
sein is futural in being ahead-of-itself, it must, in awaiting, understand

slips away and passes away. Da-sein
knows fleeting time from the "fleeting" knowledge of i/.5 death. In the kind of
talk that emphasizes time's passing away, the finite futurality of the tem­

the succession of nows as one that

porality of Da-sein is publicly reflected. And since even in the talk about
time's passing away death can remain covered over, time shows itself as
a passing away "in itself."

426

But even in this pure succession of nows passing away in itself,
primordial time reveals itself in spite of all levelling down and covering
over. The vulgar interpretation determines the flux of time as an

versible succession.

irre­

Why can time not be reversed? Especially when one

looks exclusively at the flux of nows, it is incomprehensible in itself why
the sequence of nows should not accommodate itself to the reverse
direction. The impossibility of this reversal has its basis in the prove­
nance of public time in temporality, whose temporalizing, primarily
futural, "goes" ecstatically toward its end in such a way that it "is" already
toward its end.
The vulgar characterization of time as an endless, irreversible suc­
cession of nows passing away arises from the temporality of entangled
Da-sein.

The vulgar representation of time has i/.5 natural justification.

It

belongs to the everyday kind of being of Da-sein and to the under­

history is initially and
publicly as an occurrence within time. This

standing of being initially prevalent. Thus even
for the most part understood

interpretation of time loses its exclusive and distinctive justification only
if it claims to convey the "true" concept of time and to be able to sketch
out the sole possible horizon for the interpretation of time. Rather, we
found that only from the temporality of Da-sein and its temporalizing
does it become intelligible why

and how world time belongs to it.

This inter­

pretation of the complete structure of world time is drawn from tem­
porality and gives us guidelines for "seeing" the covering over contained
in the vulgar concept of time and for estimating how far the ecstatic and
horizonal constitution of temporality has been levelled down. This ori­
entation toward the temporality of Da-sein, however, at the same time
makes it possible to demonstrate the provenance and the factical neces­
sity of this covering over that levels down, and to examine the argu­
ments for the vulgar theses on time.
On the other hand, temporality remains

inaccessible

in the hori­

zon of the vulgar understanding of time. Not only must now-time be ori­
ented primarily toward temporality in the order of possible interpreta­
tion, but it temporalizes itself only in the inauthentic temporality of
Da-sein; so if we pay attention to the derivation of now-time from tern-

II.VI

Being and Time

porality we are justified in addressing temporality as

391

primordial time.
primarily

Ecstatic and horizonal temporality temporalizes itself

from the future. However, the vulgar understanding of time sees the
fundamental phenomenon of time in the

now,

and indeed in the pure

now, cut off in its complete structure, that is called the "present." One

427

can gather from this that there is in principle no prospect of explaining
or even deriving the ecstatic and horizonal phenomenon of the Moment
that belongs to authentic temporality from

this now.

Thus the ecstatically

understood future-the datable, significant "then" -does not coincide
with the vulgar concept of the "future" in the sense of the pure nows
that have not yet arrived and are only arriving. Nor does the ecstatic hav­
ing-been, the datable, significant "on that former occasion," coincide
with the concept of the past in the sense of the past pure nows.The now
is not pregnant with the not-yet-now, but rather the present arises from
the future in the primordial, ecstatic unity of the temporalizing of tem­
porality.13
Although, initially and for the most part, the vulgar experience of
time knows only "world time," it nonetheless also always accords world
time an

eminent

relation to "soul" and "spirit." And it does this even

when an explicit and primary orientation toward philosophical ques­
tioning of the "subject" is absent. Two characteristic passages will suffice
as evidence for this. Aristotle says:

ei de meden allo pephuken arithmein e
psyche kai psyches nous, adunaton einai chronon psyches me ouses.14 And
Augustine writes: inde mihi visum est, nihil esse aliud tempus quam disten­
tionem; sed cuius rei nescio; et mirum si non ipsius animi. 15 Thus in principle
the interpretation of Da-sein as temporality does not lie beyond the
horizon of the vulgar concept of time. And Hegel made an explicit

attempt to point out the way in which time, understood in the vulgar
sense, is connected with spirit. For Kant, on the other hand, time is
indeed "subjective," but stands unconnected "next to" the "I think."16
The grounds that Hegel explicitly gave for the connection between time
and spirit are well suited for clarifying indirectly the foregoing inter­
pretation of Da-sein as temporality and our exhibition of the origin of
world time from it.

82. The Contrast of the Existential and Ontological Connection of

Temporality, Da-sein, and World Time with Hegel's Interpretation
of the Relation between Time and Spirit
History, which is essentially the history of spirit, runs its course "in
time." Thus "the development of history falls into time."17 But Hegel is
not satisfied with establishing the within-timeness of spirit as a fact, but
attempts to understand how it is possible for spirit to fall into time, which

428

392

II. VI

Being and Time

is the "completely abstract, the sensuous."18 Time must be able to receive
spirit, as it were. And spirit must in turn be related to time and its
essence. Thus we must discuss two things:
essence of time?

(1) How does Hegel define the

( 2) What belongs to the essence of spirit that makes it

possible for it to "fall into time"? Our answer to these two questions will
serve merely to

el'l.lCitklte our interpretation of Da-sein as temporality and

to do so by way of a comparison. We shall make no claim to give even a
relatively complete treatment of the allied problems in Hegel, especially
since we have no intention of "criticizing" Hegel. Because Hegel's con­
cept of time presents the most radical way in which the vulgar under­
standing of time has been given form conceptually, and one that has
received too little attention, a comparison of this concept with the idea of
temporality that we have expounded is one that especially suggests itself.

(a) Hegel's Concept of Time.

The "systematic place" in which a phil�

sophical interpretation of time is carried out can serve as a criterion
for understanding the basic guideline which leads the fundamental inter­
pretation of time. The first traditional, thematically detailed interpreta­
tion of the vulgar understanding of time is to be found in Aristotle's

Physics,
429

in the context of an ontology of

nature.

"Time" is connected

with "location" and "motion." True to the tradition, Hegel's analysis of
time has its place in the second part of his

cal Sciences bearing the title:

Encyclopedia of the Philosophi­

"The Philosophy of Nature." The first divi­

sion treats mechanics. Its first section is dedicated to a discussion of
"space and time." They are the "abstract outside-of-one-another."19
Although Hegel puts space and time together, this does not
amount simply to juxtaposing them externally: space "and also time."
"Philosophy battles with this 'also'." The transition from space to time
does not mean that they are treated in adjoining paragraphs, but "space
itself goes over." Space "is" time, that is, time is the "truth" of space.20 If
space is

thought dialectically in what it is, this being of space reveals itself

as time according to Hegel. How must space be thought?
Space is the unmediated indifference of nature's outside-itself.21
That means that space is the abstract multiplicity of the points distin­
guishable in it. Space is not interrupted by these points, but neither
does it first arise from them by way of joining them together. Space
remains in its tum undifferentiated, differentiated by the differentiable
points that are themselves space. The differentiations themselves have
the nature of what they differentiate. But yet the point is a

negation

of

space in that it differentiates something in space, though in such a way
that it itself remains in space as this negation (the point is, after all,
space). The point does not lift itself out of space as something other than
space. Space is the undifferentiated outside-one-another of the multi-

II. VI

Being and Time

393

plicity of points. But space is not a point, but, as Hegel says, "punctual­
ity ."22 On this Hegel bases his statement in which he thinks space in its
truth, that is, as time.
"Negativity, which is related to space as a point and which develops
its determinations in it as line and surface, is, however, for itself and its
determinations in the sphere of being-outside-itself, though while it is
positing as in the sphere of being-outside-itself, it appears indifferent to
what is side by side at rest. Thus posited for itself, it is time. "u
If space is represented, that is, directly looked at in the indifferent
subsistence of its distinctions, the negations are, so to speak, simply
given. But this representing does not yet grasp space in its being. That is
possible only in thought-as the synthesis that goes through thesis and
antithesis and supersedes them. Space is thought and thus grasped in
its being o nly if the negations do not simply subsist in their indiffer­
ence, but are superseded, that is, themselves negated. In the negation of
negation (that is, punctuality) the point posits itself for itself and thus
emerges from the indifference of subsistence. Posited for itself, it dis­
tinguishes itself from this or that point; it is no longer this one and not yet
that one. In positing itself for itself, it posits the succession in which it
stands, the sphere of being-outside-of-itself that is now the negated nega­
tion. The superseding of punctuality as indifference signifies that it can
no longer lie quietly in the "paralyzed stillness of space." The point
"rebels" against all the other points. According to Hegel, this negation of
negation as punctuality is time. If this discussion has any demonstrable
meaning at all , it can mean nothing other than that the positing of itself
for itself of each point is a now-here, now-here, and so on. Every point
"is" posited for itself as a now-point. "Thus the point has actuality in
time." By what means the point can posit itself for itself, always as this
point, is always a now. The condition of the possibility of the point's
positing itself for itself is the now. This condition of possibility consti­
tutes the being of the point, and being is at the same time being-thought.
Thus, since the pure thinking of punctuality, that is, of space, always
"thinks" the now and the being-outside-itself of the nows, space "is"
time. How is time itself defined?
"As the negative unity of being-outside-itself, time is similarly some­
thing absolutely abstract and ideal. It is the being that, in being, is not, and,
in not being, is: it is intuited becoming. This means that the absolutely
momentary distinctions that directly supersede themselves are determined
as external, but external to themselves. "24 Time reveals itself for this interpretation as "intuited becoming. " According to Hegel, this signifies a
transition from being to nothingness,or from nothingness to being.25
Becoming is coming into being as well as passing away. Being, or nonbeing, "goes over." What does that mean with regard to time? The being of

Being and Time

time is the now. But since every now either "now" is-no-longer, or now is­
not-yet, it can also be grasped as nonbeing. Time is

"intuited"

becoming,

that is, the transition that is not thought, but simply presents itself in the
succession of nows. If the essence of time is determined as "intuited
becoming," this reveals the fact that time is understood primarily in terms
of the now, in the way that such a now can be found by pure intuition.
We do not need any complicated discussion to make it clear that in
Hegel's interpretation of time, he is wholly moving in the direction of
the vulgar understanding of time. Hegel's characterization of time in
terms of the now presupposes that the now remains covered over and
levelled down in its full structure, so that it can be intuited as some­
thing objectively present, though objectively present only "ideally."
The fact that Hegel interprets time in terms of this primary orien­
tation toward the now that has been levelled down is proved by the fol­
lowing statements: "The now is enormously privileged-it 'is' nothing but
the individual now, but this now that is so exclusive in its revolt is dis­
solved, diffused and pulverized by my expressing it." 26 "Moreover, in
nature where time is now, no

'stable'

difference between those dimen­

sions (past and future) ever comes about."27 "In the positive sense of
time one can thus say that only the present is, the before and after are
not; but the concrete present is the result of the past and pregnant with
the future. Thus the true present is eternity."28
If Hegel calls time "intuited becoming," neither coming into being
nor passing away has priority in it. Nevertheless, on occasion he char­
acterizes time as the "abstraction of consuming," and thus formulates the
vulgar experience and interpretation of time in the most radical way.29
On the other hand, when Hegel really defines time, he is consistent

432

enough to grant no such priority to consuming and passing away as
that to which the everyday experience of time rightly adheres; for Hegel
can no more provide dialectical grounds for this priority than for the
"circumstance" (that he introduces as self-evident) that precisely when
the point posits itself for itself, the now turns up. So even when he char­
acterizes time as becoming, Hegel understands this becoming in an
"abstract" sense that goes beyond the representation of the "flux" of
time. The most appropriate expression for Hegel's interpretation of
time thus lies in the determination of time as the

negation of negation

(that is, of punctuality). Here the succession of nows is formalized in the
most extreme sense and levelled down to an unprecedented degree.30 It
is only in terms of this formal and dialectical concept of time that Hegel
can produce a connection between time and spirit.

433

(b) Hegel's Interpretation of the Connection between Time and Spirit.

In what

way has spirit itself been understood in its actualization that Hegel can

II. VI

Being and Time

395

say it is in accordance with spirit to fall into time, with time defined as
the negation of a negation? The essence of spirit is the

concept.

By this

Hegel understands not the universal that is intuited in a genus as the
form of what is thought, but the form of the very thinking that thinks
itself: Conceiving

itself-as r;rasping

the non-I. Since grasping the

non-I

presents a differentiation, there lies in the pure concept, as the grasping
of

this differentiation,

a differentiation of the difference. Thus Hegel can

define the essence of spirit formally and apophantically as the negation
of a negation. This "absolute negativity" gives a logically formalized
interpretation of Descartes'
essence of

cogito me cogitare rem

wherein he sees the

conscientia.

Thus the concept is the conceivedness of the self conceiving itself,
the way the self is authentically as it can be, that is, free. "The I is the pure
concept itself that has come to
this

first

existence

as the concept."" "But the I is

pure unity relating itself to itself, not directly, but rather, in

abstracting from all determinateness and content and going back to the
freedom of the limitless identity with itself."'2 Thus the I is
but it is "individuality" just

"universality,"

as immediately.

This negating of negation is both the "absolute unrest" of spirit
and also its

self-revelation,

which belongs to its essence. The "progres­

sion" of spirit actualizing itself in history contains a "principle of exclu­
sion. "" However, in this exclusion what is excluded does not get
detached from the spirit, it gets

surmounted.

Making itself free in over­

coming, and at the same time supporting, characterizes the freedom of
the spirit. Thus "progress" never means a quantitative more, but is essen­
tially qualitative, and indeed has the quality of spirit. "Progression" is
known and knowing itself in its goal. In every step of its "progress,"
spirit has to overcome "itself' as the truly inimical hindrance of its aim.,.
The goal of the development of spirit is "to attain its own concept."55
The development of itself is "a hard infinite struggle against itself."56
Since the restlessness of the development of

spirit bringing itself to
negation of a negation, it is in accordance with its self ­
actualization to fall "into time" as the immediate negation of a negation.
For "time is the concept itself that is there, and represents itself to con­

its concept is the

sciousness as empty intuition. For this reason spirit necessarily appears
in time, and it appears in time as long as it has

notr;rasped its pure con­
externally

cept, that is, has not annulled time. Time is the pure self that is
intuited and

not r;rasped by the self,

spirit appears in time necessarily

the concept merely intuited."" Thus

in accordance with its essence.

"Thus

world history in general is the interpretation of spirit in time, just as the
idea interprets itself in nature as space."'8 The "excluding" that belongs
to the movement of development contains a relation to nonbeing. That
is time, understood in terms of the revolt of the now.

434

396

II. VI

Being and Time

Time is "abstract" negativity. As "intuited becoming," it is the dif-

435

ferentiated self-differentiation that is directly to be found, the concept
that "is there," that is, objectively present. As something objectively pre­
sent and thus external to spirit, time has no power over the concept, but
the concept is rather "the power of time. "'9
Hegel shows the possibility of the historical actualization of spirit

the identity of the formal structure of spirit and
the negation of a negation. The most empty, formal-ontological

"in time" by going back to

time

as

and formal-apophantical abstraction into which spirit and time are exter­
nalized makes possible the production of a kinship of the two. But since
at the same time, time is yet conceived in the sense of world time that
has been absolutely levelled down, so that its provenance thus remains
completely covered over, it simply confronts spirit as something objec­
tively present. For this reason spirit

must first fall "into

time." It remains

obscure what indeed is signified ontologically by this "falling" and the
"actualization" of spirit that has power over time and really "exists" out­
side of it. Just as Hegel throws little light on the origin of time that has
been levelled down, he leaves totally unexamined the question of
whether the essential constitution of spirit as the negating of negation is
possible at all in any other way than on the basis of primordial tempo­
rality.
Whether Hegel's interpretation of time and spirit and their con­
nection is correct and has an ontologically primordial basis at all cannot be

that the formal and dialectical "construction" of
and time can be ventured at all reveals the pri­

discussed now. However,
the connection of spirit

mordial kinship of both. Hegel's "construction" was prompted by his
arduous struggle to conceive the "concretion" of the spirit. The following
statement from the concluding chapter of his Phenomenology

ofSpirit makes

that known: "Thus time appears as the very fate and necessity of spirit
when it is not in itself complete-the necessity of its giving self-conscious­
ness a richer share in consciousness, of setting in motion the immediacy

of
the in-itself(the form in which substance is in consciousness), or conversely,
of its realizing and revealing the in-itself taken as what is inward (and this
is what is first inward), that is, vindicating it for the certainty of itself. "'8
Our existential analytic of Da-sein, on the other hand, begins with
the "concretion" of factically thrown existence, and reveals temporality

436

as what makes such existence primordially possible. "Spirit" does not
first fall into time, but

exists as the primordial temporalizing of temporal­

ity. Temporality temporalizes world time, in whose horizon "history"

into time,
out of primordial, authentic

can "appear" as an occurrence within time. Spirit does not fall
but factical existence "falls," in falling prey,

temporality. This "falling," however, itself has its existential possibility in
a

mode of temporalizing that belongs to temporality.

83. The Existential and Temporal Analytic of Da-sein

and the QJ.testion of Fundamental Ontology
as to the Meaning of Being in General
The task of the foregoing considerations was to interpret the primor­
dial totality of factical Da-sein with regard to its possibilities of authentic
and inauthentic existing and to do so existentially and ontologically in
terms of its very basis. Temporality revealed itself as this basis and thus as
the meaning of being of care. Thus what the preparatory existential ana­
lytic of Da-sein contributed prior to setting forth temporality has now
been taken back into temporality as the primordial structure of the total­
ity of being of Da-sein. In terms of the possible ways in which primordial
time can temporalize itself, we have provided the grounds for those
structures that we only "indicated" earlier. Setting forth the constitu­
tion of being of Da-sein, however, still remains only one way that we
may take. Our goal is to work out the question of being in general. Our
thematic analytic of existence needs in its tum the light from a previ­
ously clarified idea of being in general. That is especially true if the
statement expressed in our introduction is retained as a standard for
every philosophical investigation: Philosophy is universal phenomeno­
logical ontology, beginning with a hermeneutic of Da-sein which, as an
analytic of existence, has made fast the guideline for all philosophical
questioning at the point where it arises and to which it returns. *41 Of
course, this thesis must not be taken dogmatically, but as a formulation
of the fundamental problem still "veiled": Can ontology be grounded
ontologically or does it also need for this an ontic foundation, and which
being must take over the function of this foundation?
The distinction between the being of existing Da-sein and the
being of beings unlike Da-sein (for example, reality) may seem to be illu­
minating, but it is only the point of departure for the ontological problematic; it is nothing with which philosophy can rest and be satisfied.
We have long known that ancient ontology deals with "reified concepts" and that the danger exists of "reifying consciousness." But what
does reifying mean? Where does it arise from? Why is being "initially"
"conceived" in terms of what is objectively present, and not in terms of
things at hand that do, after all, lie still nearer to us? Why does this reification come to dominate again and again? How is the being of "con­
sciousness" positively structured so that reification remains inappropriate to it? Is the "distinction" between " consciousness" and " thing"
sufficient at all for a primordial unfolding of the ontological problematic? Do the answers to these questions lie along our way? And can the

answer even be

searched for

II.VI

as long as the

question

of the meaning of

being in general remains unasked and unclarified?
We can never inquire into the origin and the possibility of the
"idea" of being in general with the means of formal and logical "abstrac­
tion," that is, not without a secure horizon for questions and answers.
We must look for a way * to illuminate the fundamental ontological

follow it. Whether that way is at all the only one or even the
right one can be decided only after we have followed it. The strife in rela­
tion to the interpretation of being cannot be settled because it has not yet
roen been started. And finally it cannot be '1umped into," but the begin­

question and

ning of the strife already needs preparation. This investigation is solely

underway to that. Where does it stand?
Something like "being" has been disclosed in the understanding of
being that belongs to existing Da-sein as a way in which it understands.
The preliminary disclosure of being, although it is unconceptual, makes
it possible for Da-sein as existing being-in-the-world to be related to

beings, to those it encounters in the world as well as to itself in existing.
How is the disclosive understanding of being belonging to Da·sein possible at all?
Can the question be answered by going back to the primordial constitution
of being of Da-sein that understands being? The existential and ontolog­
ical constitution of the totality of Da-sein is grounded in temporality.
Accordingly, a primordial mode of temporalizing of ecstatic temporality
itself must make the ecstatic project of being in general possible.How is
this mode of temporalizing of temporality to be interpreted? Is there a

the treatise "Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft," Logos 1 ( 19 1 0), p. 3 19. The
investigation is extensively furthered in the second part of ldeen zu einer
Philnomeno logie und phanomenologischen Pkilosopkie (Husserliana IV), the first
part of which (cf. this]ahrbuch, vol. 1, 1913) presents the problematic of "pure
consciousness" as the basis for investigating the constitution of every possible
reality. The second part gives developmental constitutional analyses and treats in
three sections: 1 . The constitution of material nature. 2. The constitution of
animal nature. 3. The constitution of the spiritual world (the personalistic for­
mula in contrast with the naturalistic one). Husser! begins his presentation with
the words: "Dilthey did formulate the problems which present the goal, the
direction which the work to be done should take, but he did not arrive at the
decisive formulations of the problem and the solutions which are methodically
correct. " Mter this first attempt, Husser! pursued the problems in a more pen­
etrating way and communicated essential sections of this in his Freiburg lec­
tures.

1 0. But the discovery of the a priori is not an "a prioristic" construction.
Through E. Husserl we have again learned not only to understand the meaning
of all genuine philosophical "empiricism," but we have also learned to use the
tools necessary for it. "A priorism" is the method of every scientific philosophy
which understands itself. Because a priorism has nothing to do with construction,
the investigation of the a priori requires the proper preparation of the phe­
nomenal foundation. The nearest horizon which must be prepared for the ana­
lytic of Da-sein lies in its average everydayness.
1 1 . Recently E. Cassirer has made mythical Da-sein the theme of a philo­
sophical interpretation. Cf. Philosophie der symbolischen Formen, part 2, "Das
mythische Denken," 1 925. Through this investigation more comprehensive
guidelines are made available to ethnological investigation. Viewed in terms of
the philosophical problematic the question remains whether the foundations of
the interpretation are sufficiently transparent, whether especially the architec­
tonic of Kant's Kritik der reinen Vemurft and its systematic content are able to
offer the possible outline for such a task at all , or whether a new and more pri­
mordial beginning is not necessary here. Cassirer himself sees the possibility of
such a task as is shown in the footnote on pages 16ff., where Cassirer points out
the phenomenological horizon disclosed by Husserl. In a conversation which the
author was able to have with Cassirer on the occasion of a lecture in the Ham­
burg group of the Kantian Society in December 1 923, a lecture on "Aufgaben
und Wege der phanomenologischen Forschung," an agreement as to the neces­
sity of an existential analytic which was sketched out in the lecture already
became apparent.

nature of corporeal substance.

hands in some direction, all the bodies in that part retreated as soon as our
hands approached them, we should never feel hardness; and yet we have no rea­
son to believe that the bodies which recede in this way would on this account
lose what makes them bodies. It follows from this that the nature of body does
not consist in hardness.
10. Ibid. The same reason shows us that weight, color, and all the other

19. Ibid., 2, pr. 3. It will be sufficient for us to observe that the perceptions
of the senses are related simply .to the intimate union which exists between

4. It is not a matter of chance that the phenomena of Angst and fear,
which have never been distinguished in a thoroughgoing way, were constitu­
tive for the scope of Christian theology ontically and also ontologically,
although in very narrow limits. This always happened when the anthropo­
logical problem of the being of human being toward God gained priority, and
phenomena such as faith, sin, love, and repentance guided the questions .
Cf. Augustine's doctrine of timor castus and servilis, which is often discussed in
his exegetical writings and letters. On fear in general, cf. "De diversis quaes­
tionibus octoginta tribus," qu. 33; "De metu," qu. 34; "Utram non aliud aman­
dum sit, quam metu carere," qu. 35; "Quid amandum sit" (Migne, ed., P. L.,
vol. 7, 23 sqq.).
Apart from the traditional context of an interpretation of poenitentia and
contritio, Luther treated the problem of fear in his commentary on Genesis,
here, of course, least of all conceptually, but all the more penetratingly by way of
edification. Cf. Enarrationes in genesin, chap. 3, WW. (Erl. edition), Eugetica
opera latina, vol. 1 , 177 et sqq.

S. Kierkegaard got furthest of all in the analysis of the phenomenon of

Angst, again in the theological context of a "pyschological" exposition of the
problem of original sin . Cf. Der Begriff der Angst, 1 844, Ges. Werke (Diedrichs ),
vol. 5.

tential and ontological interpretation of Da-sein as care in the essay of K. Bur­
dach, "Faust und die Sorge," Deutsche Vierteljahrschrift for Literatu7Wissenschaft
und Geistesgeschichte 1 ( 1 923): I ff. Burdach shows that Goethe took the care
fable, handed down as no. 220 of the fables of Hyginus, and reworked it for the
second part of his Faust. Cf. particularly pp. 40ff. The above text is cited accord­

tudo. The direction followed in our existential analytic of Da-sein toward "care"
occurred to the author in connection with attempts at an interpretation of
Augustinian, that is, Greek and Christian, anthropology with regard to the basic
foundations attained in the ontology of Aristotle.

the thesis of knowledge as a "relation of being" as the foundation for his onto­
logically oriented epistemology. Cf. Grundz:ilge einer Metaphy.sik der Erkenntnis, sec­
ond enlarged edition, 1 925. But Scheler and Hartmann both fail in the same
way, in spite of all the differences between their phenomenological point of

departure, to recognize that "ontology" fails in its traditional, basic orientation
with regard to Da-sein and that precisely the "relation of being" (cf. above,
pp. 79ff. ) contained in knowledge forces us to its furulmnmtal revision, not just to
a critical improvement. Because Hartmann underestimates the inexplicit scope
of influence of an ontologically unclarified positing of the relation of being, he
is forced into a "critical realism" which is basically completely strange to the
level of problematic put forth by him. For Hartmann's interpretation of ontol­

6. The anthropology developed in Christian theology-from Paul to Calvin's

meditatio futurae vitae has always already viewed death together with its inter­
-

pretation of "life." Dilthey, whose true philosophical tendencies aimed at an
ontology of "life," could not fail to recognize its connection with death. "And
finally, the relation which most deeply and universally defmes the feeling of our
Da-sein-that of life toward death, for the limitation of our existence by death is
always decisive for our understanding and our estimation of life." Das Erlebnis und
die Dichtung, 5th edition, p. 230. Recently G. Simmel has also explicitly related the
phenomenon of death to the definition of "life," however without a clear sepa­
ration of the biological and ontic from the ontological and existential problem­
atic. Cf. Lebensanschauung: Vier metaphysische Kapitel, 1 9 1 8, pp. 99- 153. For the
present inquiry, compare especially K. Jaspers, Psychologie der Weltanschauungen,
3rd edition, 1 925, p. 299ff. and especially 259-70. Jaspers understands death by
following the guidelines of the phenomenon of the "borderline situation" devel­
oped by him, whose fundamental significance lies beyond any typology of "atti­
tudes" and "worldviews. "
R . Unger took u p Dilthey's suggestions in his work Herder, Novalis und

Kleist: Studien iiber die Entwicklung des Todesproblems im Denken und Dichten von
Sturm und Drang Zur Romantik, 1922. Unger offers a major reflection on Dilthey's
questions in the lecture: Literaturegeschichte als Problemgeschichte: Zur Frage geis­
teshistorischer Synthese, mit besonderer Beziehung auf W. Dilthey (Schriften der Konigs­
berger Gelehrten Gesellschaft, Geisteswiss. Klass 1. 1, 1 924). Unger (pp. 1 7ff. ) sees
clearly the significance of phenomenological investigation for a more radical
foundation of the "problems of life."

the monograph just published of H. G. Stoker, Das Gewissen , in Schriften zur
Philosophie und Soziologie, ed. Max Scheler, vol. 2, 1925. This broadly conceived
inquiry clarifies a manifold richness of phenomena of conscience, character­
izes critically the various possible kinds of treating the phenomenon, and notes
further literature which is not complete with regard to the history of and concept
of conscience. Stoker's monograph differs from our existential interpretation
already in his initial position and thus also in its conclusions in spite of many
points of agreement. Stoker underestimates from the beginning the hermeneu­
tical conditions for a "description" of the "objectively real conscience," p. 3.
Hand in hand with this goes the muddling of the borderlines between phe­
nomenology and theology-to the detriment of both. With regard to the anthro­
pological foundations of the inquiry which Scheler's personalism takes over, cf.
the present inquiry, section 10. Still, Stoker's monograph signifies considerable
progress as compared with the traditional interpretations of conscience, but
more by the comprehensive treatment of the phenomenon of conscience and its
ramifications, than by pointing out the ontological roots of the phenomenon.

and determined in terms of what he can essentially be ( cf. the preface to the first
edition). From this the existential ontological significance of "borderline situa­
tions" becomes clear. The philosophical tendency of this work is completely
missed if one uses it solely as an encyclopedia of "types of worldviews. "

2. The being guilty that belongs primordially to the constitution of being
of Da-sein is to be distinguished from the status corruptionis as it is understood by
theology. Theology can find an ontological condition of its factical possibility in

Notes for pp. 283-295 (German pp. 306-320)

411

being guilty as it is defined existentially. Th e guilty contained in the idea of this
status is a factical indebtedness of a completely unique kind. It has its own attes­
tation that remains fundamentally closed off to every philosophical experience.
The existential analysis of being-guilty does not prove anythingfor or against the
possibility of sin. Strictly speaking, one cannot even say that the ontology of
Da-sein leaves this possibility open at all of its own accord since, as philosophical
questioning, it "knows" nothing about sin in principle.

19. The fact that Kant in principle conceived the ontological character of
the self of the person within the horizon of an inappropriate ontology of things
objectively present in the world as "substantial things" becomes clear in the
material that H. Heimsoeth worked on in his essays Personlichkeitsbewu.ss tsein
und Ding an sick in der Kantischen Philosophie, (reprint from Immanuel Kant:
Festschrift zur zweiten]ahrhundertsfeier seines Geburtstages, 1 924). The tendency of
the essay goes beyond a historiographical report and aims at the "categorial"
problem of personality. Heimsoeth (pp. 3 1 f.) says:
There is still too little consideration of the close working together of the­
oretical and practical reason as Kant practised and planned it. One does
not sufficiently notice how even the categories (in contrast to their natu-

412

Notesjor pp. 295-31 1 (German pp. 320-338)
ralistic fulfillment in the "principles") are here to receive explicit validity
and find a new application free of natural rationalism with the primacy of
practical reason (for example, substance in the "person" and the dura­
tion of personal immortality, causality as "causality through freedom,"
reciprocity in the "community of reasonable beings," etc.). As a means of
establishing things in thought, they serve as a new access to the uncondi­
tioned without wishing to give rationalizing knowledge of objects.

But, after all , the real ontological problem has been passed over here. The ques­
tion cannot be omitted whether these "categories" can maintain primordial
validity and only need to be applied differently, or whether they do not in prin­
ciple distorl the ontological problematic of Da-sein. Even if theoretical reason is
included in practical reason, the existential and ontological problematic of the
self remains not only unsolved, but unasked. On what ontological basis is the
"working together" of theoretical and practical reason supposed to occur? Does
theoretical behavior determine the kind of being of the person, or is it the prac­
tical reason or neither of the two-and which one then? Do not the paralo­
gisms, in spite of their fundamental significance, reveal the lack of ontological
foundation of the problematic of the self from Descartes' res cogitans to Hegel's
concept of the Spirit? One does not even need to think "naturalistically" or
"rationalistically" and can yet be in subservience to an ontology of the "sub­
stantial" that is only all the more fatal because it is seemingly self-evident. Cf. as
an essential complement to the above-mentioned essay, Heimsoeth, "Die metha­
physischen Motive in der Ausbuildung des kritischen Idealismus," Kantstudien
29 ( 1 924): 1 2 1 ff. For the critique of Kant's concept of the I, cf. also Max Scheler,

defines the Moment with the help of the now an d eternity. When Kierkegaard
speaks of "temporality," he means hwnan being's being-in-time. Time as within­
time-ness knows only the now, but never a moment. But if the moment is expe­
rienced existentielly, a more primordial temporality is presupposed, although
existentially inexplicit. In relation to the "Moment," cf. K. Jaspers, Psychologie der

Cf. Logische Untersuchungen ( 1 901), vol. 2, pp. 588, 620. The intentional analysis of
perception and intuition in general had to suggest this "temporal" characteri­
zation of the phenomenon. How the intentionality of "consciousness" is grounded
in the ecstatic temporality of Da-sein will be shown in the following division.

4. We shall not go into the problem of time measurement in the theory of
relativity here. The illumination of the ontological foundations of this mea­
surement already presupposes a clarification of world time and within-timeness
in terms of the temporality of Da-sein and the explication of the existential and
temporal constitution of the discovery of nature and the temporal meaning of
measurement in general as well. An axiomatic of the technique of physical mea­
surement is based on these investigations and can never in its turn explicate the
problem of time as such.
5. For a first attempt at the interpretation of chronological time and "his­
torical numeration," cf. the Freiburg habilitation lecture of the author (SS 1915):
"Der Zeitbegriff in der Geschichtswissenschaft," published in the Zeitschrift for
Philosophie und philosophische Kritik vol. 1 6 1 ( 1 9 1 6): 1 73ff. The connections
between historical numeration, astronomically calculated world time, and the
temporality and historicity of Da-sein need further investigation. Cf. also G.
Simmel, "Das Problem der historischen Zeit," in Philos. Vonriige, published by the
Kantgesellschaft, no. 1 2 ( 1 916). The two fundamental works on the develop­
ment of historiographical chronology are: Josephus Justus Scalinger, De emen­
datione temporum, 1583, and Dionysus Petavius, SJ., opus de doctrina temporum,
1 627. For the ancient time reckoning, cf. G. Bilfinger, Die antiken Stundenangaben

13. We do not need to discuss in detail the fact that the traditional concept
of eternity in the significance of the "standing now" (nunc stans ) is drawn from
the vulgar understanding of time and defined in orientation toward the idea of
"constant" objective presence. If the eternity of God could be philosophically
"constructed," it could be understood only as more primordial and "infinite"
temporality. Whether or not the via negationis et eminentiae could offer a possible
way remains an open question.
14. Physics, 14, 223a25; cf. 1 1 , 2 1 8b29- 2 1 9a1, 2 19a4-6. "But if nothing
other than the soul or the soul's mind were naturally equipped for numbering,
then if there were no soul, time would be impossible. "

than an extendedness; but of what sort of thing it is an extendedness I do not

itself. "

emerges in Kant than in Hegel will be shown in the first section of the second
part of this treatise.

understanding o f time, and that means a t the same time the traditional concept
of time. We can show that Hegel's concept of time is even drawn directly from
Aristotle's Physics. In the]enenser Logik (cf. G. Lasson's edition, 1923 ) that was
projected at the time of Hegel's habilitation, the analysis of time of the Enzy­
klopadie is already developed in all its essential constituents. The section on
time (pp. 202fT. ) reveals itself to even the roughest examination as a paraphrase
of the Aristotelian treatise on time. Already in the Jenenser Logik, Hegel develops
his interpretation of time in the scope of the philosophy of nature (p. 1 86); its
first part is entitled "The System of the Sun" (p. 186 ) . Following the conceptual
determination of the ether and motion, Hegel discusses the concept of time. The
analysis of space is still subordinate here. Although dialectic already breaks
through, it does not have the later, rigid, schematic form, but still makes possible
a more flexible understanding of the phenomena. On the way from Kant to
Hegel's developed system, a decisive impact of Aristotelian ontology and logic
comes about once more. As a fact this has been long familiar. But the way,
manner, and limits of this influence are just as obscure today. A concrete, com­
parative, philosophical interpretation of Hegel's Jenenser Logik and Aristotle's
Physics and Metaphysics will throw new light on this. A few rough references will
suffice for the above reflections.
Aristotle sees the essence of time in the nun; Hegel in the now. Aristotle
conceives the nun as horos; Hegel interprets the now as "limit." Aristotle under­
stands the nun as stigme; Hegel interprets the now as point. Aristotle character­
izes the nun as tode ti; Hegel calls the now the "absolute this. " Aristotle con­
nects chronos with sphaira, in accordance with the tradition; Hegel emphasizes the
"circular course" of time. Of course, Hegel misses the central tendency of Aris­
totle's analysis of time of discovering a foundational connection (akolouthein)
between the nun, horos, stigme, and tode ti.
In spite of all differences in reasoning, Bergson's interpretation agrees
with Hegel's thesis that space "is" time. Bergson just turns it around: Time
(temps) is space. Bergson's interpretation of time, too, obviously grew out of an
interpretation of Aristotle's treatise on time. It is not just a matter of an exter­
nal literary connection that simultaneously with Bergson's Essa i sur les don­
nees immediates de la conscience, where the problem of temps and duree is
expounded, a treatise of Bergson's appeared with the title: Quid Aristoteles de
loco senserit. With regard to the Aristotelian definition of time as arithmos kine­
seas, Bergson analyses number before analyzing time. Time as space ( cf. Essa i, p.
69) is quantitative succession. Duration is described in a counter-orientation
toward this concept of time as qualitative succession. This is not the place for a
critical discussion of Bergson's concept of time and other present-day inter­
pretations of time. To the extent that anything essential has been gained at all
beyond Aristotle and Kant, the concern is more with grasping time and "time
consciousness." By referring to the direct connection of Hegel's concept of
time and Aristotle's analysis of time, we do not intend to charge Hegel with
being "dependent," but to point out thefundamental ontological scope of this affil­
iation for Hegel's Logic. On "Aristotle and Hegel," cf. the essay with this title of
Nicolai Hartmann in Beitrage zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus, vol. 3
( 1 923), pp. 1 -36.

LEXICON

ON THE C OMPOSITION OF THE L EXICON

The following Lexicon has been composed with the help of the follow­
ing sources, each of which is here gratefully acknowledged as a powerful
tool, each in its own way, in the labor of its composition:
Hildegard Feick, Index zu Heifkggers 'Sein und Zeit'. Fourth newly revised edition
by Susanne Ziegler. Tiibingen: Niemeyer, 1961, 4 1 99 1 .
Rainer A Bast/Heinrich P . Delfosse, Handbuch zum Textstudium von Martin Hei­
fkggers 'Sein und Zeit '. Vol. 1 : Stellenindiz.es; Philologisch-kritischer Apparat.
Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: frommann-holzboog, 1980.
John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, translators of Martin Heidegger, Being
and Time. New York/San Francisco: Harper-Collins, 1 962. "Index of
English Expressions (Latin Expressions; Greek Expressions; Proper
Names)," pp. 524-589.

All three sources, including the English index by Macquarrie and Robin­

son, refer to the pagination of the original German edition of Sein und
Zeit (Tiibingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag, 71953, 16 1986), pp. 1 -437, which
since the 14th edition ( 1 97 7 ) also lists Heidegger's later marginal
remarks in an appendix, "Randbemerkungen aus dem Handexemplar
des Autors," pp. 439-445. Following this convention, the following Lex­
icon also lists the pagination of the original German edition, which is to
be found in the margins of the pages of this transla tion.
Since this translation presents Heidegger's later marginal remarks
as footnotes to the appropriate pages within the body of the transla-

419

420

Being and Time

tion itself, these footnotes will be identified in the Lexicon by the des­
ignation "fn" preceded by the German page number, "85fn, " for exam­
ple (here citing the longest of the marginal remarks ) . Heidegger's 157
marginal remarks, ranging from a single word to a lengthy paragraph or
a long list, are to be found on 101 pages of the German text of 437
pages .
Heidegger's footnotes to the original edition ( 1927) are now listed
at the end of this translation under "Author's Notes" and numbered
within each chapter; these endnotes are accordingly identified in the
Lexicon by German page number followed by the designation "n." and
the number assigned to the note, " 190 n.

4," for example.

I have, on occasion, italicized particularly important page num­
b ers within the individual entry and, on rarer occasion, parenthesized
pivotal page numbers where the entry is clearly being alluded to without
actually being named. Subentries are by and large ordered, not alpha­
betically, but more or less

seriatim

or "genealogically," in the order in

which the idea is initially broached in the sequence of the text. For
s ome of the entries, I have borrowed subentries extensively from the
abundant Index by Macquarri e and Robinson. For others, I have relied
heavily on the computer-generated list of page numbers presented by
Bast/Delfosse, without however trying to be exhaustive with the highest­
frequency terms, especially in their combining forms so prolific in the
German language.
Since this Lexicon is not designed to serve as an index for this work, I
have avoided the temptation to cite extensive "exergues" that would serve to
define terms in greater depth, as is the case in Feick's "Index" and in Albert
Hofstadter's lengthy Lexicon to his translation of Heidegger's The

Probkms ofPherwmenology. In lieu of this,

Bo.sic

I have relied more than usually both

on the briefest of subentries and on the

"See also" cross-referencing at the

end of especially some of the less familiar entries, in order to suggest the
relational context from which the terms spring.
I have omitted a number of minor entries provided in the English
index by Macquarrie and Robinson, amplifying however its focus on
ordinary expressions and phrases like "giving to understand" and "hav­
ing to be," which play crucial albeit often incipient roles in Heidegger's
argument, and added and/ or developed some neglected terms which
have come to be recognized as important to the developmental infras­
tructure of the published Divisions of Being

and Time. Finally,

in a few

rare instances, I have made a halting beginning toward illustrating how
some common idioms ("in the Light of," "with Regard to") also function
in a methodological way for Heidegger in the development of his opus
magnum. A shift in emphasis in entries chosen was in part also dictated
by the incorporation of Heidegger's later marginal remarks into this

Lexicon

42 1

English translation. But Feick's index in particular is devoted to relating
the terms of Being

and Time to those of Heidegger's later works, thereby
turning it, as Heidegger himself remarks in praise of Feick's Index, into
a "Way-not a Work . "
I n sum, the following important conventions should be noted by
users of this Lexicon:
Usage of the

n. 1 = reference to Heidegger's original Notes, now listed numerically in

S UPPLEMENTAL LEXICON OF THE
LATER MA RGINAL REMARKS (-fn)
Listed below are s ome of the German terms in the marginal remarks
that could not easily be accommodated into the above Lexicon of the
most important terms in the vocabulary of Being

constitute terms proper to the later Heidegger, notably from the period
of the

Beitriige

Philosophic ( 1 936-38) and reflecting its major divi­
(Anklang), play (Zuspiel}, and leap (Sprung).

See also

above, for s ome of the connective links between the two works,

in terms like Belonging; Clearing; Constancy; Ek-sistence; Essence
