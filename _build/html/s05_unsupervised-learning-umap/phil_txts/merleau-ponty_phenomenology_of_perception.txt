Phenomenology of Percept ion
‘In this text, the body-organism is linked to the world
through a network of primal signiﬁcations, which arise
from the perception of things.’
Michel Foucault
‘We live in an age of tele-presence and virtual reality.
The sciences of the mind are ﬁnally paying heed to the
centrality of body and world. Everything around us
drives home the intimacy of perception, action and
thought. In this emerging nexus, the work of MerleauPonty has never been more timely, or had more to teach
us . . . The Phenomenology of Perception covers all the
bases, from simple perception-action routines to the
full Monty of conciousness, reason and the elusive self.
Essential reading for anyone who cares about the
embodied mind.’

What is phenomenology? It may seem strange that this question has
still to be asked half a century after the ﬁrst works of Husserl. The
fact remains that it has by no means been answered. Phenomenology
is the study of essences; and according to it, all problems amount to
ﬁnding deﬁnitions of essences: the essence of perception, or the
essence of consciousness, for example. But phenomenology is also a
philosophy which puts essences back into existence, and does not
expect to arrive at an understanding of man and the world from any
starting point other than that of their ‘facticity’. It is a transcendental
philosophy which places in abeyance the assertions arising out of
the natural attitude, the better to understand them; but it is also a
philosophy for which the world is always ‘already there’ before
reﬂection begins—as ’an inalienable presence; and all its eﬀorts are
concentrated upon re-achieving a direct and primitive contact with
the world, and endowing that contact with a philosophical status. It is
the search for a philosophy which shall be a ‘rigorous science’, but
it also oﬀers an account of space, time and the world as we ‘live’
them. It tries to give a direct description of our experience as it is,
without taking account of its psychological origin and the causal
explanations which the scientist, the historian or the sociologist may
be able to provide. Yet Husserl in his last works mentions a ‘genetic

viii preface
phenomenology’,1 and even a ‘constructive phenomenology’.2 One
may try to do away with these contradictions by making a distinction between Husserl’s and Heidegger’s phenomenologies; yet the
whole of Sein und Zeit springs from an indication given by Husserl
and amounts to no more than an explicit account of the ‘natürlicher
Weltbegriﬀ ’ or the ‘Lebenswelt’ which Husserl, towards the end
of his life, identiﬁed as the central theme of phenomenology,
with the result that the contradiction reappears in Husserl’s own
philosophy. The reader pressed for time will be inclined to give up the
idea of covering a doctrine which says everything, and will wonder
whether a philosophy which cannot deﬁne its scope deserves all the
discussion which has gone on around it, and whether he is not faced
rather by a myth or a fashion.
Even if this were the case, there would still be a need to understand
the prestige of the myth and the origin of the fashion, and the opinion
of the responsible philosopher must be that phenomenology can be practised
and identiﬁed as a manner or style of thinking, that it existed as a movement before
arriving at complete awareness of itself as a philosophy. It has been long on the
way, and its adherents have discovered it in every quarter, certainly in
Hegel and Kierkegaard, but equally in Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. A
purely linguistic examination of the texts in question would yield no
proof; we ﬁnd in texts only what we put into them, and if ever any kind
of history has suggested the interpretations which should be put on it,
it is the history of philosophy. We shall ﬁnd in ourselves, and nowhere
else, the unity and true meaning of phenomenology. It is less a question of counting up quotations than of determining and expressing in
concrete form this phenomenology for ourselves which has given a number of
present-day readers the impression, on reading Husserl or Heidegger,
not so much of encountering a new philosophy as of recognizing what
they had been waiting for. Phenomenology is accessible only through a
phenomenological method. Let us, therefore, try systematically to
bring together the celebrated phenomenological themes as they have
grown spontaneously together in life. Perhaps we shall then understand

Berger has kindly referred us.

why phenomenology has for so long remained at an initial stage, as a
problem to be solved and a hope to be realized.
It is a matter of describing, not of explaining or analysing. Husserl’s
ﬁrst directive to phenomenology, in its early stages, to be a ‘descriptive
psychology’, or to return to the ‘things themselves’, is from the start a
foreswearing of science. I am not the outcome or the meeting-point of
numerous causal agencies which determine my bodily or psychological make-up. I cannot conceive myself as nothing but a bit of the
world, a mere object of biological, psychological or sociological
investigation. I cannot shut myself up within the realm of science. All
my knowledge of the world, even my scientiﬁc knowledge, is gained
from my own particular point of view, or from some experience of the
world without which the symbols of science would be meaningless.
The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly
experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we
must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which
science is the second-order expression. Science has not and never will
have, by its nature, the same signiﬁcance qua form of being as the world
which we perceive, for the simple reason that it is a rationale or explanation of that world. I am, not a ‘living creature’ nor even a ‘man’, nor
again even ‘a consciousness’ endowed with all the characteristics
which zoology, social anatomy or inductive psychology recognize in
these various products of the natural or historical process—I am the
absolute source, my existence does not stem from my antecedents,
from my physical and social environment; instead it moves out towards
them and sustains them, for I alone bring into being for myself (and
therefore into being in the only sense that the word can have for me)
the tradition which I elect to carry on, or the horizon whose distance
from me would be abolished—since that distance is not one of its
properties—if I were not there to scan it with my gaze. Scientiﬁc points
of view, according to which my existence is a moment of the world’s,
are always both naïve and at the same time dishonest, because they take
for granted, without explicitly mentioning, it, the other point of view,
namely that of consciousness, through which from the outset a world
forms itself round me and begins to exist for me. To return to things

ix

preface

themselves is to return to that world which precedes knowledge, of
which knowledge always speaks, and in relation to which every scientiﬁc
schematization is an abstract and derivative sign-language, as is
geography in relation to the country-side in which we have learnt
beforehand what a forest, a prairie or a river is.
This move is absolutely distinct from the idealist return to consciousness, and the demand for a pure description excludes equally the
procedure of analytical reﬂection on the one hand, and that of scientiﬁc
explanation on the other. Descartes and particularly Kant detached the
subject, or consciousness, by showing that I could not possibly apprehend anything as existing unless I ﬁrst of all experienced myself as
existing in the act of apprehending it. They presented consciousness,
the absolute certainty of my existence for myself, as the condition of
there being anything at all; and the act of relating as the basis of
relatedness. It is true that the act of relating is nothing if divorced from
the spectacle of the world in which relations are found; the unity of
consciousness in Kant is achieved simultaneously with that of the
world. And in Descartes methodical doubt does not deprive us of anything, since the whole world, at least in so far as we experience it, is
reinstated in the Cogito, enjoying equal certainty, and simply labelled
‘thought of . . . But the relations between subject and world are not
strictly bilateral: if they were, the certainty of the world would, in
Descartes, be immediately given with that of the Cogito, and Kant would
not have talked about his ‘Copernican revolution’. Analytical reﬂection
starts from our experience of the world and goes back to the subject as
to a condition of possibility distinct from that experience, revealing the
all-embracing synthesis as that without which there would be no
world. To this extent it ceases to remain part of our experience and
oﬀers, in place of an account, a reconstruction. It is understandable, in
view of this, that Husserl, having accused Kant of adopting a ‘faculty
psychologism’,3 should have urged, in place of a noetic analysis which
bases the world on the synthesizing activity of the subject, his own
‘noematic reﬂection’ which remains within the object and, instead of
begetting it, brings to light its fundamental unity.
The world is there before any possible analysis of mine, and it would

preface

be artiﬁcial to make it the outcome of a series of syntheses which link,
in the ﬁrst place sensations, then aspects of the object corresponding to
diﬀerent perspectives, when both are nothing but products of analysis,
with no sort of prior reality. Analytical reﬂection believes that it can
trace back the course followed by a prior constituting act and arrive, in
the ‘inner man’—to use Saint Augustine’s expression—at a constituting power which has always been identical with that inner self. Thus
reﬂection is carried oﬀ by itself and installs itself in an impregnable
subjectivity, as yet untouched by being and time. But this is very
ingenuous, or at least it is an incomplete form of reﬂection which loses
sight of its own beginning. When I begin to reﬂect my reﬂection bears
upon an unreﬂective experience; moreover my reﬂection cannot be
unaware of itself as an event, and so it appears to itself in the light of a
truly creative act, of a changed structure of consciousness, and yet it
has to recognize, as having priority over its own operations, the world
which is given to the subject because the subject is given to himself.
The real has to be described, not constructed or formed. Which means
that I cannot put perception into the same category as the syntheses
represented by judgements, acts or predications. My ﬁeld of perception
is constantly ﬁlled with a play of colours, noises and ﬂeeting tactile
sensations which I cannot relate precisely to the context of my clearly
perceived world, yet which I nevertheless immediately ‘place’ in the
world, without ever confusing them with my daydreams. Equally constantly I weave dreams round things. I imagine people and things
whose presence is not incompatible with the context, yet who are not
in fact involved in it: they are ahead of reality, in the realm of the
imaginary. If the reality of my perception were based solely on the
intrinsic coherence of ‘representations’, it ought to be for ever hesitant
and, being wrapped up in my conjectures on probabilities. I ought to
be ceaselessly taking apart misleading syntheses, and reinstating in
reality stray phenomena which I had excluded in the ﬁrst place. But this
does not happen. The real is a closely woven fabric. It does not await
our judgement before incorporating the most surprising phenomena,
or before rejecting the most plausible ﬁgments of our imagination.
Perception is not a science of the world, it is not even an act, a deliberate taking up of a position; it is the background from which all acts
stand out, and is presupposed by them. The world is not an object such

xi

preface

that I have in my possession the law of its making; it is the natural
setting of, and ﬁeld for, all my thoughts and all my explicit perceptions.
Truth does not ‘inhabit’ only ‘the inner man’,4 or more accurately,
there is no inner man, man is in the world, and only in the world does
he know himself. When I return to myself from an excursion into the
realm of dogmatic common sense or of science, I ﬁnd, not a source of
intrinsic truth, but a subject destined to the world.
All of which reveals the true meaning of the famous phenomenological reduction. There is probably no question over which Husserl
spent more time—or to which he more often returned, since the
‘problematic of reduction’ occupies an important place in his
unpublished work. For a long time, and even in recent texts, the reduction is presented as the return to a transcendental consciousness before
which the world is spread out and completely transparent, quickened
through and through by a series of apperceptions which it is the philosopher’s task to reconstitute on the basis of their outcome. Thus my
sensation of redness is perceived as the manifestation of a certain redness
experienced, this in turn as the manifestation of a red surface, which is
the manifestation of a piece of red cardboard, and this ﬁnally is the
manifestation or outline of a red thing, namely this book. We are to
understand, then, that it is the apprehension of a certain hylè, as indicating a phenomenon of a higher degree, the Sinngebung, or active
meaning-giving operation which may be said to deﬁne consciousness,
so that the world is nothing but ‘world-as-meaning’, and the phenomenological reduction is idealistic, in the sense that there is here a
transcendental idealism which treats the world as an indivisible unity
of value shared by Peter and Paul, in which their perspectives blend.
‘Peter’s consciousness’ and ‘Paul’s consciousness’ are in communication, the perception of the world ‘by Peter’ is not Peter’s doing any
more than its perception ‘by Paul’ is Paul’s doing; in each case it is the
doing of pre-personal forms of consciousness, whose communication
raises no problem, since it is demanded by the very deﬁnition of consciousness, meaning or truth. In so far as I am a consciousness, that is,
in so far as something has meaning for me, I am neither here nor there,
4

In te redi; in interiore homine habitat veritas (Saint Augustine).

preface

neither Peter nor Paul; I am in no way distinguishable from an ‘other’
consciousness, since we are immediately in touch with the world and
since the world is, by deﬁnition, unique, being the system in which all
truths cohere. A logically consistent transcendental idealism rids the
world of its opacity and its transcendence. The world is precisely that
thing of which we form a representation, not as men or as empirical
subjects, but in so far as we are all one light and participate in the One
without destroying its unity. Analytical reﬂection knows nothing of the
problem of other minds, or of that of the world, because it insists that
with the ﬁrst glimmer of consciousness there appears in me theoretically the power of reaching some universal truth, and that the other
person, being equally without thisness, location or body, the Alter and
the Ego are one and the same in the true world which is the uniﬁer of
minds. There is no diﬃculty in understanding how I can conceive the
Other, because the I and consequently the Other are not conceived as
part of the woven stuﬀ of phenomena; they have validity rather than
existence. There is nothing hidden behind these faces and gestures, no
domain to which I have no access, merely a little shadow which owes
its very existence to the light. For Husserl, on the contrary, it is well
known that there is a problem of other people, and the alter ego is a
paradox. If the other is truly for himself alone, beyond his being for
me, and if we are for each other and not both for God, we must
necessarily have some appearance for each other. He must and I must
have an outer appearance, and there must be, besides the perspective of
the For Oneself—my view of myself and the other’s of himself—a
perspective of For Others—my view of others and theirs of me. Of
course, these two perspectives, in each one of us, cannot be simply
juxtaposed, for in that case it is not I that the other would see, nor he that I should see.
I must be the exterior that I present to others, and the body of the other
must be the other himself. This paradox and the dialectic of the Ego
and the Alter are possible only provided that the Ego and the Alter Ego
are deﬁned by their situation and are not freed from all inherence; that
is, provided that philosophy does not culminate in a return to the self,
and that I discover by reﬂection not only my presence to myself, but
also the possibility of an ‘outside spectator’; that is, again, provided that
at the very moment when I experience my existence—at the ultimate
extremity of reﬂection—I fall short of the ultimate density which

xiii

xiv preface
would place me outside time, and that I discover within myself a
kind of internal weakness standing in the way of my being totally
individualized: a weakness which exposes me to the gaze of others as a
man among men or at least as a consciousness among consciousness.
Hitherto the Cogito depreciated the perception of others, teaching me as
it did that the I is accessible only to itself, since it deﬁned me as the
thought which I have of myself, and which clearly I am alone in having,
at least in this ultimate sense. For the ‘other’ to be more than an empty
word, it is necessary that my existence should never be reduced to my
bare awareness of existing, but that it should take in also the awareness
that one may have of it, and thus include my incarnation in some nature
and the possibility, at least, of a historical situation. The Cogito must
reveal me in a situation, and it is on this condition alone that transcendental subjectivity can, as Husserl puts it,5 be an intersubjectivity. As a
meditating Ego, I can clearly distinguish from myself the world and
things, since I certainly do not exist in the way in which things exist. I
must even set aside from myself my body understood as a thing among
things, as a collection of physico-chemical processes. But even if the
cogitatio, which I thus discover, is without location in objective time and
space, it is not without place in the phenomenological world. The
world, which I distinguished from myself as the totality of things or of
processes linked by causal relationships, I rediscover ‘in me’ as the
permanent horizon of all my cogitationes and as a dimension in relation
to which I am constantly situating myself. The true Cogito does not
deﬁne the subject’s existence in terms of the thought he has of existing,
and furthermore does not convert the indubitability of the world into
the indubitability of thought about the world, nor ﬁnally does it
replace the world itself by the world as meaning. On the contrary it
recognizes my thought itself as an inalienable fact, and does away with
any kind of idealism in revealing me as ‘being-in-the-world’.
It is because we are through and through compounded of relationships with the world that for us the only way to become aware of the
fact is to suspend the resultant activity, to refuse it our complicity (to
look at it ohne mitzumachen, as Husserl often says), or yet again, to put it
‘out of play’. Not because we reject the certainties of common sense

preface

and a natural attitude to things—they are, on the contrary, the constant
theme of philosophy—but because, being the presupposed basis of any
thought, they are taken for granted, and go unnoticed, and because in
order to arouse them and bring them to view, we have to suspend for a
moment our recognition of them. The best formulation of the reduction is probably that given by Eugen Fink, Husserl’s assistant, when he
spoke of ‘wonder’ in the face of the world.6 Reﬂection does not
withdraw from the world towards the unity of consciousness as the
world’s basis; it steps back to watch the forms of transcendence ﬂy up
like sparks from a ﬁre; it slackens the intentional threads which attach
us to the world and thus brings them to our notice; it alone is consciousness of the world because it reveals that world as strange and
paradoxical. Husserl’s transcendental is not Kant’s and Husserl accuses
Kant’s philosophy of being ‘worldly’, because it makes use of our relation to the world, which is the motive force of the transcendental
deduction, and makes the world immanent in the subject, instead of
being ﬁlled with wonder at it and conceiving the subject as a process of
transcendence towards the world. All the misunderstandings with his
interpreters, with the existentialist ‘dissidents’ and ﬁnally with himself, have arisen from the fact that in order to see the world and grasp
it as paradoxical, we must break with our familiar acceptance of it
and, also, from the fact that from this break we can learn nothing but
the unmotivated upsurge of the world. The most important lesson
which the reduction teaches us is the impossibility of a complete
reduction. This is why Husserl is constantly re-examining the possibility of the reduction. If we were absolute mind, the reduction would
present no problem. But since, on the contrary, we are in the world,
since indeed our reﬂections are carried out in the temporal ﬂux on
the which we are trying to seize (since they sich einströmen, as Husserl
says), there is no thought which embraces all our thought. The philosopher, as the unpublished works declare, is a perpetual beginner,
which means that he takes for granted nothing that men, learned or
otherwise, believe they know. It means also that philosophy itself must
not take itself for granted, in so far as it may have managed to say
something true; that it is an ever-renewed experiment in making its

xvi preface
own beginning; that it consists wholly in the description of this
beginning, and ﬁnally, that radical reﬂection amounts to a consciousness of its own dependence on an unreﬂective life which is its initial
situation, unchanging, given once and for all. Far from being, as has
been thought, a procedure of idealistic philosophy, phenomenological reduction belongs to existential philosophy: Heidegger’s
‘being-in-the-world’ appears only against the background of the
phenomenological reduction.
A misunderstanding of a similar kind confuses the notion of the
‘essences’ in Husserl. Every reduction, says Husserl, as well as being
transcendental is necessarily eidetic. That means that we cannot subject
our perception of the world to philosophical scrutiny without ceasing
to be identiﬁed with that act of positing the world, with that interest in
it which delimits us, without drawing back from our commitment
which is itself thus made to appear as a spectacle, without passing from
the fact of our existence to its nature, from the Dasein to the Wesen. But it
is clear that the essence is here not the end, but a means, that our
eﬀective involvement in the world is precisely what has to be understood and made amenable to conceptualization, for it is what polarizes
all our conceptual particularizations. The need to proceed by way of
essences does not mean that philosophy takes them as its object, but,
on the contrary, that our existence is too tightly held in the world to be
able to know itself as such at the moment of its involvement, and that it
requires the ﬁeld of ideality in order to become acquainted with and to
prevail over its facticity. The Vienna Circle, as is well known, lays it
down categorically that we can enter into relations only with meanings. For example, ‘consciousness’ is not for the Vienna Circle identiﬁable with what we are. It is a complex meaning which has developed
late in time, which should be handled with care, and only after the
many meanings which have contributed, throughout the word’s
semantic development, to the formation of its present one have been
made explicit. Logical positivism of this kind is the antithesis of
Husserl’s thought. Whatever the subtle changes of meaning which
have ultimately brought us, as a linguistic acquisition, the word and
concept of consciousness, we enjoy direct access to what it designates.
For we have the experience of ourselves, of that consciousness which

preface

we are, and it is on the basis of this experience that all linguistic
connotations are assessed, and precisely through it that language comes
to have any meaning at all for us. ‘It is that as yet dumb experience . . .
which we are concerned to lead to the pure expression of its own
meaning.’7 Husserl’s essences are destined to bring back all the living
relationships of experience, as the ﬁsherman’s net draws up from the
depths of the ocean quivering ﬁsh and seaweed. Jean Wahl is therefore
wrong in saying that ‘Husserl separates essences from existence’.8 The
separated essences are those of language. It is the oﬃce of language to
cause essences to exist in a state of separation which is in fact merely
apparent, since through language they still rest upon the antepredicative life of consciousness. In the silence of primary consciousness can be seen appearing not only what words mean, but also what
things mean: the core of primary meaning round which the acts of
naming and expression take shape.
Seeking the essence of consciousness will therefore not consist in
developing the Wortbedeutung of consciousness and escaping from existence into the universe of things said; it will consist in rediscovering my
actual presence to myself, the fact of my consciousness which is in the
last resort what the word and the concept of consciousness mean.
Looking for the world’s essence is not looking for what it is as an idea
once it has been reduced to a theme of discourse; it is looking for what
it is as a fact for us, before any thematization. Sensationalism ‘reduces’
the world by noting that after all we never experience anything but
states of ourselves. Transcendental idealism too ‘reduces’ the world
since, in so far as it guarantees the world, it does so by regarding it as
thought or consciousness of the world, and as the mere correlative of
our knowledge, with the result that it becomes immanent in consciousness and the aseity of things is thereby done away with. The
eidetic reduction is, on the other hand, the determination to bring the
world to light as it is before any falling back on ourselves has occurred,
it is the ambition to make reﬂection emulate the unreﬂective life of
consciousness. I aim at and perceive a world. If I said, as do the sensationalists, that we have here only ‘states of consciousness’, and if I tried

xviii preface
to distinguish my perceptions from my dreams with the aid of ‘criteria’, I should overlook the phenomenon of the world. For if I am able
to talk about ‘dreams’ and ‘reality’, to bother my head about the
distinction between imaginary and real, and cast doubt upon the ‘real’,
it is because this distinction is already made by me before any analysis;
it is because I have an experience of the real as of the imaginary, and
the problem then becomes one not of asking how critical thought can
provide for itself secondary equivalents of this distinction, but of making explicit our primordial knowledge of the ‘real’, of describing our
perception of the world as that upon which our idea of truth is forever
based. We must not, therefore, wonder whether we really perceive a
world, we must instead say: the world is what we perceive. In more
general terms we must not wonder whether our self-evident truths are
real truths, or whether, through some perversity inherent in our
minds, that which is self-evident for us might not be illusory in relation to some truth in itself. For in so far as we talk about illusion, it is
because we have identiﬁed illusions, and done so solely in the light of
some perception which at the same time gave assurance of its own
truth. It follows that doubt, or the fear of being mistaken, testiﬁes as
soon as it arises to our power of unmasking error, and that it could
never ﬁnally tear us away from truth. We are in the realm of truth and it
is ‘the experience of truth’ which is self-evident.9 To seek the essence
of perception is to declare that perception is, not presumed true, but
deﬁned as access to truth. So, if I now wanted, according to idealistic
principles, to base this de facto self-evident truth, this irresistible belief,
on some absolute self-evident truth, that is, on the absolute clarity
which my thoughts have for me; if I tried to ﬁnd in myself a creative
thought which bodied forth the framework of the world or illumined
it through and through, I should once more prove unfaithful to my
experience of the world, and should be looking for what makes that
experience possible instead of looking for what it is. The self-evidence
of perception is not adequate thought or apodeictic self-evidence.10
The world is not what I think, but what I live through. I am open to the

world, I have no doubt that I am in communication with it, but I do not
possess it; it is inexhaustible. ‘There is a world’, or rather: ‘There is
the world’; I can never completely account for this ever-reiterated
assertion in my life. This facticity of the world is what constitutes the
Weltlichkeit der Welt, what causes the world to be the world; just as the
facticity of the cogito is not an imperfection in itself, but rather what
assures me of my existence. The eidetic method is the method of a
phenomenological positivism which bases the possible on the real.
We can now consider the notion of intentionality, too often cited as
the main discovery of phenomenology, whereas it is understandable
only through the reduction. “All consciousness is consciousness of
something’; there is nothing new in that. Kant showed, in the Refutation of
Idealism, that inner perception is impossible without outer perception,
that the world, as a collection of connected phenomena, is anticipated
in the consciousness of my unity, and is the means whereby I come into
being as a consciousness. What distinguishes intentionality from the
Kantian relation to a possible object is that the unity of the world,
before being posited by knowledge in a speciﬁc act of identiﬁcation,
is ‘lived’ as ready-made or already there. Kant himself shows in the
Critique of Judgement that there exists a unity of the imagination and the
understanding and a unity of subjects before the object, and that, in experiencing the beautiful, for example, I am aware of a harmony between
sensation and concept, between myself and others, which is itself
without any concept. Here the subject is no longer the universal
thinker of a system of objects rigorously interrelated, the positing
power who subjects the manifold to the law of the understanding, in so
far as he is to be able to put together a world—he discovers and enjoys
his own nature as spontaneously in harmony with the law of the
understanding. But if the subject has a nature, then the hidden art of the
imagination must condition the categorial activity. It is no longer
merely the aesthetic judgement, but knowledge too which rests upon
this art, an art which forms the basis of the unity of consciousness and
of consciousness.
Husserl takes up again the Critique of Judgement when he talks about a
teleology of consciousness. It is not a matter of duplicating human
consciousness with some absolute thought which, from outside, is

xix

imagined as assigning to it its aims. It is a question of recognizing
consciousness itself as a project of the world, meant for a world which
it neither embraces nor possesses, but towards which it is perpetually
directed—and the world as this pre-objective individual whose
imperious unity decrees what knowledge shall take as its goal. This is
why Husserl distinguishes between intentionality of act, which is that
of our judgements and of those occasions when we voluntarily take up
a position—the only intentionality discussed in the Critique of Pure
Reason—and operative intentionality (fungierende Intentionalität), or that
which produces the natural and antepredicative unity of the world and
of our life, being apparent in our desires, our evaluations and in the
landscape we see, more clearly than in objective knowledge, and furnishing the text which our knowledge tries to translate into precise
language. Our relationship to the world, as it is untiringly enunciated
within us, is not a thing which can be any further clariﬁed by analysis;
philosophy can only place it once more before our eyes and present it
for our ratiﬁcation.
Through this broadened notion of intentionality, phenomenological
‘comprehension’ is distinguished from traditional ‘intelfection’, which
is conﬁned to ‘true and immutable natures’, and so phenomenology
can become a phenomenology of origins. Whether we are concerned
with a thing perceived, a historical event or a doctrine, to ‘understand’
is to take in the total intention—not only what these things are for
representation (the ‘properties’ of the thing perceived, the mass of
‘historical facts’, the ‘ideas’ introduced by the doctrine)—but the
unique mode of existing expressed in the properties of the pebble,
the glass or the piece of wax, in all the events of a revolution, in all the
thoughts of a philosopher. It is a matter, in the case of each civilization,
of ﬁnding the Idea in the Hegelian sense, that is, not a law of the
physico-mathematical type, discoverable by objective thought, but that
formula which sums up some unique manner of behaviour towards
others, towards Nature, time and death: a certain way of patterning the
world which the historian should be capable of seizing upon the making his own. These are the dimensions of history. In this context there is
not a human word, not a gesture, even one which is the outcome of
habit or absent-mindedness, which has not some meaning. For
example, I may have been under the impression that I lapsed into

preface

silence through weariness, or some minister may have thought he had
uttered merely an appropriate platitude, yet my silence or his words
immediately take on a signiﬁcance, because my fatigue or his falling
back upon a ready-made formula are not accidental, for they express a
certain lack of interest, and hence some degree of adoption of a deﬁnite
position in relation to the situation.
When an event is considered at close quarters, at the moment when
it is lived through, everything seems subject to chance: one man’s
ambition, some lucky encounter, some local circumstance or other
appears to have been decisive. But chance happenings oﬀset each other,
and facts in their multiplicity coalesce and show up a certain way of
taking a stand in relation to the human situation, reveal in fact an event
which has its deﬁnite outline and about which we can talk. Should the
starting-point for the understanding of history be ideology, or politics,
or religion, or economics? Should we try to understand a doctrine
from its overt content, or from the psychological make-up and the
biography of its author? We must seek an understanding from all these
angles simultaneously, everything has meaning, and we shall ﬁnd this
same structure of being underlying all relationships. All these views are
true provided that they are not isolated, that we delve deeply into
history and reach the unique core of existential meaning which
emerges in each perspective. It is true, as Marx says, that history does
not walk on its head, but it is also true that it does not think with its
feet. Or one should say rather that it is neither its ‘head’ not its ‘feet’
that we have to worry about, but its body. All economic and psychological explanations of a doctrine are true, since the thinker never
thinks from any starting-point but the one constituted by what he is.
Reﬂection even on a doctrine will be complete only if it succeeds in
linking up with the doctrine’s history and the extraneous explanations
of it, and in putting back the causes and meaning of the doctrine in an
existential structure. There is, as Husserl says, a ‘genesis of meaning’
(Sinngenesis),11 which alone, in the last resort, teaches us what the
doctrine ‘means.’ Like understanding, criticism must be pursued at
all levels, and naturally, it will be insuﬃcient, for the refutation of a
11

Formale und transzendentale Logik, pp. 184 and ﬀ.

xxii preface
doctrine, to relate it to some accidental event in the author’s life: its
signiﬁcance goes beyond, and there is no pure accident in existence
or in co-existence, since both absorb random events and transmute
them into the rational.
Finally, as it is indivisible in the present, history is equally so in its
sequences. Considered in the light of its fundamental dimensions, all
periods of history appear as manifestations of a single existence, or as
episodes in a single drama—without our knowing whether it has an
ending. Because we are in the world, we are condemned to meaning, and we
cannot do or say anything without its acquiring a name in history.
Probably the chief gain from phenomenology is to have united
extreme subjectivism and extreme objectivism in its notion of the
world or of rationality. Rationality is precisely proportioned to the
experiences in which it is disclosed. To say that there exists rationality is
to say that perspectives blend, perceptions conﬁrm each other, a meaning emerges. But it should not be set in a realm apart, transposed into
absolute Spirit, or into a world in the realist sense. The phenomenological world is not pure being, but the sense which is revealed where
the paths of my various experiences intersect, and also where my own
and other people’s intersect and engage each other like gears. It is thus
inseparable from subjectivity and intersubjectivity, which ﬁnd their
unity when I either take up my past experiences in those of the present,
or other people’s in my own. For the ﬁrst time the philosopher’s thinking is suﬃciently conscious not to anticipate itself and endow its own
results with reiﬁed form in the world. The philosopher tries to conceive
the world, others and himself and their interrelations. But the meditating Ego, the ‘impartial spectator’ (uninteressierter Zuschauer)12 do not
rediscover an already given rationality, they ‘establish themselves’,13
and establish it, by an act of initiative which has no guarantee in being,
its justiﬁcation resting entirely on the eﬀective power which it confers
on us of taking our own history upon ourselves.
The phenomenological world is not the bringing to explicit expression of a pre-existing being, but the laying down of being. Philosophy

is not the reﬂection of a pre-existing truth, but, like art, the act of
bringing, truth into being. One may well ask how this creation is
possible, and if it does not recapture in things a pre-existing Reason. The
answer is that the only pre-existent Logos is the world itself, and that
the philosophy which brings it into visible existence does not begin by
being possible; it is actual or real like the world of which it is a part, and
no explanatory hypothesis is clearer than the act whereby we take up
this unﬁnished world in an eﬀort to complete and conceive it. Rationality is not a problem. There is behind it no unknown quantity which has
to be determined by deduction, or, beginning with it, demonstrated
inductively. We witness every minute the miracle of related experience,
and yet nobody knows better than we do how this miracle is worked,
for we are ourselves this network of relationships. The world and reason are not problematical. We may say, if we wish, that they are mysterious, but their mystery deﬁnes them: there can be no question of
dispelling it by some ‘solution’, it is on the hither side of all solutions.
True philosophy consists in relearning to look at the world, and in this
sense a historical account can give meaning to the world quite as
‘deeply’ as a philosophical treatise. We take our fate in our hands, we
become responsible for our history through reﬂection, but equally by a
decision on which we stake our life, and in both cases what is involved
is a violent act which is validated by being performed.
Phenomenology, as a disclosure of the world, rests on itself, or
rather provides its own foundation.14 All cognitions are sustained by a
‘ground’ of postulates and ﬁnally by our communication with the
world as primary embodiment of rationality. Philosophy, as radical
reﬂection, dispenses in principle with this resource. As, however, it too
is in history, it too exploits the world and constituted reason. It must
therefore put to itself the question which it puts to all branches of
knowledge, and so duplicate itself inﬁnitely, being, as Husserl says, a
dialogue or inﬁnite meditation, and, in so far as it remains faithful to its
intention, never knowing where it is going. The unﬁnished nature of
phenomenology and the inchoative atmosphere which has surrounded

another sense.

it are not to be taken as a sign of failure, they were inevitable because
phenomenology’s task was to reveal the mystery of the world and
of reason.15 If phenomenology was a movement before becoming a
doctrine or a philosophical system, this was attributable neither to
accident, nor to fraudulent intent. It is as painstaking as the works of
Balzac, Proust, Valéry or Cézanne—by reason of the same kind of
attentiveness and wonder, the same demand for awareness, the same
will to seize the meaning of the world or of history as that meaning
comes into being. In this way it merges into the general eﬀort of
modern thought.

Traditional Prejudices and the
Return to Phenomena

1
THE ‘SENSATION’ AS A
UNIT OF EXPERIENCE
At the outset of the study of perception, we ﬁnd in language the notion
of sensation, which seems immediate and obvious: I have a sensation
of redness, of blueness, of hot or cold. It will, however, be seen that
nothing could in fact be more confused, and that because they accepted
it readily, traditional analyses missed the phenomenon of perception.
I might in the ﬁrst place understand by sensation the way in which I
am aﬀected and the experiencing of a state of myself. The greyness
which, when I close my eyes, surrounds me, leaving no distance
between me and it, the sounds that encroach on my drowsiness and
hum ‘in my head’ perhaps give some indication of what pure sensation
might be. I might be said to have sense-experience (sentir) precisely to
the extent that I coincide with the sensed, that the latter ceases to have
any place in the objective world, and that it signiﬁes nothing for me.
This entails recognizing that sensation should be sought on the hither
side of any qualiﬁed content, since red and blue, in order to be distinguishable as two colours, must already form some picture before
me, even though no precise place be assigned to them, and thus cease
to be part of myself. Pute sensation will be the experience of an undifferentiated, instantaneous, dotlike impact. It is unnecessary to show,
since authors are agreed on it, that this notion corresponds to nothing

4

phenomenology of perception

in our experience, and that the most rudimentary factual perceptions that
we are acquainted with, in creatures such as the ape or the hen, have a
bearing on relationships and not on any absolute terms.1 But this does
not dispose of the question as to why we feel justiﬁed in theory in
distinguishing within experience a layer of ‘impression’. Let us
imagine a white patch on a homogeneous background. All the points
in the patch have a certain ‘function’ in common, that of forming
themselves into a ‘shape’. The colour of the shape is more intense, and
as it were more resistant than that of the background; the edges of the
white patch ‘belong’ to it, and are not part of the background although
they adjoin it: the patch appears to be placed on the background and
does not break it up. Each part arouses the expectation of more than it
contains, and this elementary perception is therefore already charged
with a meaning. But if the shape and the background, as a whole, are not
sensed, they must be sensed, one may object, in each of their points. To
say this is to forget that each point in its turn can be perceived only as a
ﬁgure on a background. When Gestalt theory informs us that a ﬁgure
on a background is the simplest sense-given available to us, we reply
that this is not a contingent characteristic of factual perception, which
leaves us free, in an ideal analysis, to bring in the notion of impressions.
It is the very deﬁnition of the phenomenon of perception, that without
which a phenomenon cannot be said to be perception at all. The perceptual ‘something’ is always in the middle of something else, it always
forms part of a ‘ﬁeld’. A really homogeneous area oﬀering nothing to be
cannot be given to any perception. The structure of actual perception alone
can teach us what perception is. The pure impression is, therefore, not
only undiscoverable, but also imperceptible and so inconceivable as an
instant of perception. If it is introduced, it is because instead of attending to the experience of perception, we overlook it in favour of the
object perceived. A visual ﬁeld is not made up of limited views. But an
object seen is made up of bits of matter, and spatial points are external
to each other. An isolated datum of perception is inconceivable, at
least if we do the mental experiment of attempting to perceive such
a thing. But in the world there are either isolated objects or a physical
void.

the ‘sensation’ as a unit of experience

I shall therefore give up any attempt to deﬁne sensation as pure
impression. Rather, to see is to have colours or lights, to hear is to have
sounds, to sense (sentir) is to have qualities. To know what senseexperience is, then, is it not enough to have seen a red or to have heard
an A? But red and green are not sensations, they are the sensed (sensibles), and quality is not an element of consciousness, but a property of
the object. Instead of providing a simple means of delimiting sensations, if we consider it in the experience itself which evinces it, the
quality is as rich and mysterious as the object, or indeed the whole
spectacle, perceived. This red patch which I see on the carpet is red
only in virtue of a shadow which lies across it, its quality is apparent
only in relation to the play of light upon it, and hence as an element in
a spatial conﬁguration. Moreover the colour can be said to be there
only if it occupies an area of a certain size, too small an area not being
describable in these terms. Finally this red would literally not be the
same if it were not the ‘woolly red’ of a carpet.2 Analysis, then, discovers in each quality meanings which reside in it. It may be objected
that this is true only of the qualities which form part of our actual
experience, which are overlaid with a body of knowledge, and that we
are still justiﬁed in conceiving a ‘pure quality’ which would set limits
to a pure sensation. But as we have just seen, this pure sensation would
amount to no sensation, and thus to not feeling at all. The alleged selfevidence of sensation is not based on any testimony of consciousness,
but on widely held prejudice. We think we know perfectly well what
‘seeing’, ‘hearing’, ‘sensing’ are, because perception has long provided
us with objects which are coloured or which emit sounds. When we
try to analyse it, we transpose these objects into consciousness. We
commit what psychologists call ‘the experience error’, which means
that what we know to be in things themselves we immediately take as
being in our consciousness of them. We make perception out of things
perceived. And since perceived things themselves are obviously accessible only through perception, we end by understanding neither. We are
caught up in the world and we do not succeed in extricating ourselves
from it in order to achieve consciousness of the world. If we did we
should see that the quality is never experienced immediately, and that

all consciousness is consciousness of something. Nor is this ‘something’ necessarily an identiﬁable object. There are two ways of being
mistaken about quality: one is to make it into an element of consciousness, when in fact it is an object for consciousness, to treat it as an
incommunicable impression, whereas it always has a meaning; the
other is to think that this meaning and this object, at the level of
quality, are fully developed and determinate. The second error, like the
ﬁrst, springs from our prejudice about the world. Suppose we construct, by the use of optics and geometry, that bit of the world which
can at any moment throw its image on our retina. Everything outside
its perimeter, since it does not reﬂect upon any sensitive area, no more
aﬀects our vision than does light falling on our closed eyes. We ought,
then, to perceive a segment of the world precisely delimited, surrounded by a zone of blackness, packed full of qualities with no interval between them, held together by deﬁnite relationships of size similar
to those lying on the retina. The fact is that experience oﬀers nothing
like this, and we shall never, using the world as our starting-point,
understand what a ﬁeld of vision is. Even if it is possible to trace out a
perimeter of vision by gradually approaching the centre of the lateral
stimuli, the results of such measurement vary from one moment to
another, and one never manages to determine the instant when a stimulus once seen is seen no longer. The region surrounding the visual ﬁeld
is not easy to describe, but what is certain is that it is neither black nor
grey. There occurs here an indeterminate vision, a vision of something or other,
and, to take the extreme case, what is behind my back is not without
some element of visual presence. The two straight lines in MüllerLyer’s optical illusion (Fig. 1) are neither of equal nor unequal length;
it is only in the objective world that this question arises.3 The visual
ﬁeld is that strange zone in which contradictory notions jostle each

other because the objects—the straight lines of Müller-Lyer—are not,
in that ﬁeld, assigned to the realm of being, in which a comparison
would be possible, but each is taken in its private context as if it did not
belong to the same universe as the other. Psychologists have for a long
time taken great care to overlook these phenomena. In the world taken
in itself everything is determined. There are many unclear sights, as for
example a landscape on a misty day, but then we always say that no real
landscape is in itself unclear. It is so only for us. The object, psychologists would assert, is never ambiguous, but becomes so only through
our inattention. The bounds of the visual ﬁeld are not themselves variable, and there is a moment when the approaching object begins absolutely to be seen, but we do not ‘notice’ it. But the notion of attention,
as we shall show more fully, is supported by no evidence provided by
consciousness. It is no more than an auxiliary hypothesis, evolved to
save the prejudice in favour of an objective world. We must recognize
the indeterminate as a positive phenomenon. It is in this atmosphere
that quality arises. Its meaning is an equivocal meaning; we are concerned with an expressive value rather than with logical signiﬁcation.
The determinate quality by which empiricism tried to deﬁne sensation
is an object, not an element, of consciousness, indeed it is the very
lately developed object of scientiﬁc consciousness. For these two
reasons, it conceals rather than reveals subjectivity.
The two deﬁnitions of sensation which we have just tried out were
only apparently direct. We have seen that they were based on the object
perceived. In this they were in agreement with common sense, which
also identiﬁes the sensible by the objective conditions which govern it.
The visible is what is seized upon with the eyes, the sensible is what is
seized on by the senses. Let us follow up the idea of sensation on this
basis,4 and see what becomes of this ‘by’ and this ‘with’, and the
4
There is no justiﬁcation for dodging the issue, as does Jaspers, for example (Zur Analyse
der Trugwahrnehmungen) by setting up in opposition, on the one hand a descriptive psychology which ‘understands’ phenomena, and on the other an explanatory psychology,
which concerns itself with their origin. The psychologist always sees consciousness as
placed in the body in the midst of the world, and for him the series stimulus–
impression–perception is a sequence of events at the end of which perception begins.
Each consciousness is born in the world and each perception is a new birth of consciousness. In this perspective the ‘immediate’ data of perception can always be challenged as

notion of sense-organ, in the ﬁrst-order thinking constituted by science. Having shown that there is no experience of sensation, do we at
least ﬁnd, in its causes and objective origins, any reasons for retaining it
as an explanatory concept? Physiology, to which the psychologist turns
as to a higher court of appeal, is in the same predicament as psychology. It too ﬁrst situates its object in the world and treats it as a bit of
extension. Behaviour is thus hidden by the reﬂex, the elaboration and
patterning of stimuli, by a longitudinal theory of nervous functioning,
which establishes a theoretical correspondence between each element
of the situation and an element of the reaction.5 As in the case of the
reﬂex are theory, physiology of perception begins by recognizing an
anatomical path leading from a receive through a deﬁnite transmitter to a
recording station,6 equally specialized. The objective world being
given, it is assumed that it passes on to the sense-organs messages
which must be registered, then deciphered in such a way as to reproduce in us the original text. Hence we have in principle a point-bypoint correspondence and constant connection between the stimulus
and the elementary perception. But this ‘constancy hypothesis’7 conﬂicts with the data of consciousness, and the very psychologists who
accept it recognize its purely theoretical character.8 For example, the
intensity of a sound under certain circumstances lowers its pitch; the
addition of auxiliary lines makes two ﬁgures unequal which are objectively equal;9 a coloured area appears to be the same colour over the
whole of its surface, whereas the chromatic thresholds of the diﬀerent
mere appearances and as complex products of an origin. The descriptive method can
acquire a genuine claim only from the transcendental point of view. But, even from this
point of view, the problem remains as to how consciousness perceives itself or appears to
itself as inserted in a nature. For the philosopher, as for the psychologist, there is therefore always a problem of origins, and the only method possible is to follow, in its
scientiﬁc development, the causal explanation in order to make its meaning quite clear,
and assign to it its proper place in the body of truth. That is why there will be found no
refutation, but only an eﬀort to understand the diﬃculties peculiar to causal thinking.

parts of the retina ought to make it red in one place, orange somewhere
else, and in certain cases colourless.10 Should these cases in which the
phenomenon does not correspond to the stimulus be retained within
the framework of the law of constancy, and explained by additional
factors—attention and judgement—or must the law itself be jettisoned? When red and green, presented together, give the result grey, it
is conceded that the central combination of stimuli can immediately
give rise to a diﬀerent sensation from what the objective stimuli would
lead us to expect. When the apparent size of an object varies with its
apparent distance, or its apparent colour with our recollections of the
object, it is recognized that ‘the sensory processes are not immune to
central inﬂuences’.11 In this case, therefore, the ‘sensible’ cannot be
deﬁned as the immediate eﬀect of an external stimulus. Cannot the
same conclusion be drawn from the ﬁrst three examples we have mentioned? If attention, more precise instructions, rest or prolonged practice ﬁnally bring perception into line with the law of constancy, this
does not prove the law’s universal validity, for, in the examples quoted,
the ﬁrst appearance possessed a sensory character just as incontestable
as the ﬁnal results obtained. So the question is whether attentive perception, the subject’s concentration on one point of the visual ﬁeld—
for example, the ‘analytic perception’ of the two main lines in MüllerLyer’s optical illusion—do not, instead of revealing the ‘normal sensation’, substitute a special set-up for the original phenomenon.12 The
law of constancy cannot avail itself, against the testimony of consciousness, of any crucial experiment in which it is not already implied, and
wherever we believe that we are establishing it, it is already presupposed.13 If we turn back to the phenomena, they show us that the
apprehension of a quality, just as that of size, is bound up with a whole
perceptual context, and that the stimuli no longer furnish us with the

13
It is only fair to add that this is true of all theories, and that nowhere is there a crucial
experiment. For the same reason the constancy hypothesis cannot be completely refuted
on the basis of induction. It is discredited because it overlooks phenomena and does not
permit any understanding of them. To discern them and to pass judgement on the
hypothesis, indeed, one must ‘suspend’ it.

indirect means we were seeking of isolating a layer of immediate
impressions. But when we look for an ‘objective’ deﬁnition of sensation, it is not only the physical stimulus which slips through our ﬁngers. The sensory apparatus, as conceived by modern physiology, is no
longer ﬁtted for the rôle of ‘transmitter’ cast for it by traditional science. Non-cortical lesions of the apparatus of touch no doubt lessen
the concentration of points sensitive to heat and cold, or pressure, and
diminish the sensitivity of those that remain. But if, to the injured
system, a suﬃciently extensive stimulus be applied, the speciﬁc sensations reappear. The raising of the thresholds is compensated by a more
vigorous movement of the hand.14
One can discern, at the rudimentary stage of sensibility, a working
together on the part of partial stimuli and a collaboration of the sensory with the motor system which, in a variable physiological constellation, keeps sensation constant, and rules out any deﬁnition of the
nervous process as the simple transmission of a given message. The
destruction of sight, wherever the injuries be sustained, follows
the same law: all colours are aﬀected in the ﬁrst place,15 and lose their
saturation. Then the spectrum is simpliﬁed, being reduced to four and
soon to two colours; ﬁnally a grey monochrome stage is reached,
although the pathological colour is never identiﬁable with any normal
one. Thus in central as in peripheral lesions ‘the loss of nervous substance results not only in a deﬁciency of certain qualities, but in the
change to a less diﬀerentiated and more primitive structure’.16 Conversely, normal functioning must be understood as a process of integration in which the text of the external world is not so much copied,
as composed. And if we try to seize ‘sensation’ within the perspective
of the bodily phenomena which pave the way to it, we ﬁnd not a
psychic individual, a function of certain known variables, but a formation already bound up with a larger whole, already endowed with a
meaning, distinguishable only in degree from the more complex
14

Even daltonism does not prove that certain systems are, and are alone in being,
entrusted with ‘seeing’ red and green, since a colour-blind person manages to distinguish red if a large area in that colour is put before him, or if the presentation of the
colour is made to last a long time. Id. ibid., p. 365.

perceptions, and which therefore gets us no further in our attempt to
delimit pure sensation. There is no physiological deﬁnition of sensation, and more generally there is no physiological psychology which is
autonomous, because the physiological event itself obeys biological
and psychological laws. For a long time it was thought that peripheral
conditioning was the surest method of identifying ‘elementary’ psychic functions, and of distinguishing them from ‘superior’ functions
less strictly bound up with the bodily substructure. A closer analysis,
however, reveals that the two kinds of function overlap. The elementary
is no longer that which by addition will cumulatively constitute the
whole, nor is it a mere occasion for the whole to constitute itself. The
elementary event is already invested with meaning, and the higher
function will bring into being only a more integrated mode of existence or a more valid adaptation, by using and sublimating the subordinate operations. Conversely, ‘sense-experience is a vital process, no
less than procreation, breathing or growth’.17 Psychology and physiology are no longer, then, two parallel sciences, but two accounts of
behaviour, the ﬁrst concrete, the second abstract.18 We said that when
the psychologist asks the physiologist for a deﬁnition of sensation ‘in
causal terms’, he encounters once more on this new ground his familiar diﬃculties, and now we can see why. The physiologist for his part
has to rid himself of the realistic prejudice which all the sciences
borrow from common sense, and which hampers them in their development. The changed meaning of the terms ‘elementary’ and ‘more
advanced’ in modern physiology proclaims a changed philosophy.19
The scientist too must learn to criticize the idea of an external world in
itself, since the facts themselves prompt him to abandon that of the
body as a transmitter of messages. The sensible is what is apprehended
with the senses, but now we know that this ‘with’ is not merely instrumental, that the sensory apparatus is not a conductor, that even on
the periphery the physiological impression is involved in relations
formerly considered central.

science—obscures what we thought was clear. We believed we knew
what feeling, seeing and hearing were, and now these words raise
problems. We are invited to go back to the experiences to which they
refer in order to redeﬁne them. The traditional notion of sensation was
not a concept born of reﬂection, but a late product of thought directed
towards objects, the last element in the representation of the world, the
furthest removed from its original source, and therefore the most
unclear. Inevitably science, in its general eﬀort towards objectiﬁcation,
evolved a picture of the human organism as a physical system undergoing stimuli which were themselves identiﬁed by their physicochemical properties, and tried to reconstitute actual perception20 on
this basis, and to close the circle of scientiﬁc knowledge by discovering
the laws governing the production of knowledge itself, by establishing
an objective science of subjectivity.21 But it is also inevitable that this
attempt should fail. If we return to the objective investigations themselves, we ﬁrst of all discover that the conditions external to the sensory
ﬁeld do not govern it part for part, and that they exert an eﬀect only to
the extent of making possible a basic pattern—which is what Gestalt
theory makes clear. Then we see that within the organism the structure
depends on variables such as the biological meaning of the situation,
which are no longer physical variables, with the result that the whole
eludes the well-known instruments of physico-mathematical analysis,
and opens the way to another type of intelligibility.22 If we now turn
back, as is done here, towards perceptual experience, we notice that
science succeeds in constructing only a semblance of subjectivity: it
introduces sensations which are things, just where experience shows
that there are meaningful patterns; it forces the phenomenal universe
into categories which make sense only in the universe of science. It
requires that two perceived lines, like two real lines, should be equal or
unequal, that a perceived crystal should have a deﬁnite number of

‘The sensations are certainly artiﬁcial products, but not arbitrary ones, they are the last
component wholes into which the natural structures can be decomposed by the “analytical attitude”. Seen from this point of view, they contribute to the knowledge of
structures, and consequently the results of the study of sensations, correctly interpreted,
are an important element in the psychology of perception.’ Koﬀka, Psychologie, p. 548.

sides,23 without realizing that the perceived, by its nature, admits of the
ambiguous, the shifting, and is shaped by its context. In Müller-Lyer’s
illusion, one of the lines ceases to be equal to the other without becoming ‘unequal’: it becomes ‘diﬀerent’. That is to say, an isolated, objective line, and the same line taken in a ﬁgure, cease to be, for perception,
‘the same’. It is identiﬁable in these two functions only by analytic
perception, which is not natural. In the same way the perceived contains gaps which are not mere ‘failures to perceive’. I may, through
sight or touch, recognize a crystal as having a ‘regular’ shape without
having, even tacitly, counted its sides. I may be familiar with a face
without ever having perceived the colour of the eyes in themselves. The
theory of sensation, which builds up all knowledge out of determinate
qualities, oﬀers us objects purged of all ambiguity, pure and absolute,
the ideal rather than the real themes of knowledge: in short, it is
compatible only with the lately developed superstructure of consciousness. That is where ‘the idea of sensation is approximately
realized’.24
The images which instinct projects before it, those which tradition
recreates in each generation, or simply dreams, are in the ﬁrst place
presented on an equal footing with genuine perceptions, and gradually, by critical labour, the true, present and explicit perception is
distinguished from phantasms. The word perception indicates a direction
rather than a primitive function.25 It is known that the uniformity of
apparent size of objects at diﬀerent distances, or of their colour in
diﬀerent lights, is more perfect in children than in adults.26 It follows
that perception is more strictly bound up with the local stimulus in its
developed than in its undeveloped state, and more in conformity with
the theory of sensation in the adult than in the child. It is like a net with

its knots showing up more and more clearly.27 ‘Primitive thought’ has
been pictured in a way which can be understood only if the responses
of primitive people, their pronouncements and the sociologists’ interpretations are related to the fund of perceptual experience which they
are all trying to translate.28 It is sometimes the adherence of the perceived object to its context, and, as it were, its viscosity, sometimes the
presence in it of a positive indeterminate which prevents the spatial,
temporal and numerical wholes from becoming articulated into manageable, distinct and identiﬁable terms. And it is this pre-objective
realm that we have to explore in ourselves if we wish to understand
sense experience.

2
‘ASSOCIATION’ AND THE
‘PROJECTION OF MEMORIES’
Once introduced, the notion of sensation distorts any analysis of perception. Already a ‘ﬁgure’ on a ‘background’ contains, as we have seen,
much more than the qualities presented at a given time. It has an
‘outline’, which does not ‘belong’ to the background and which
‘stands out’ from it; it is ‘stable’ and oﬀers a ‘compact’ area of colour,
the background on the other hand having no bounds, being of indeﬁnite colouring and ‘running on’ under the ﬁgure. The diﬀerent parts of
the whole—for example, the portions of the ﬁgure nearest to the
background—possess, then, besides a colour and qualities, a particular
signiﬁcance. The question is, what makes up this signiﬁcance, what do the
words ‘edge’ and ‘outline’ mean, what happens when a collection of
qualities is apprehended as a ﬁgure on a background? But once sensation is
introduced as an element of knowledge, we are left no leeway in our
reply. A being capable of sense-experience (sentir)—in the sense of
coinciding absolutely with an impression or a quality—could have no
other mode of knowing. That a quality, an area of red should signify
something, that it should be, for example, seen as a patch on a background, means that the red is not this warm colour which I feel and
live in and lose myself in, but that it announces something else which it
does not include, that it exercises a cognitive function, and that its parts

16

phenomenology of perception

together make up a whole to which each is related without leaving its
place. Henceforth the red is no longer merely there, it represents something for me, and what it represents is not possessed as a ‘real part’ of
my perception, but only aimed at as an ‘intentional part’.1 My gaze
does not merge with the outline or the patch as it does with the redness
considered concretely: it ranges over and dominates them. In order
to receive in itself a meaning which really transfuses it, in order to become integrated into an ‘outline’ which is bound up with the ‘ﬁgure’
and independent of ‘background’, the atomic sensation ought to cease
to be an absolute coincidence, which means ceasing to exist as a sensation. If we admit ‘sensation’ in the classical sense, the meaning of that
which is sensed can be found only in further sensations, actual or
virtual. Seeing a ﬁgure can be only simultaneously experiencing all the
atomic sensations which go to form it. Each one remains for ever what
it is, a blind contact, an impression, while the whole collection of these
becomes ‘vision’, and forms a picture before us because we learn to
pass quickly from one impression to another. A shape is nothing but a
sum of limited views, and the consciousness of a shape is a collective
entity. The sensible elements of which it is made up cannot lose the
opacity which deﬁnes them as sensory given,
and open themselves to some intrinsic connection, to some law of conformation governing
them all.
Let three points A, B and C be taken on the
outline of a ﬁgure: their spatial order is both their
way of coexisting before our eyes and that coexistence itself, however near together be the
points chosen: the sum of their separate existences, the position of A, plus the position of B, plus the position of C. It may well
happen that empiricism abandons this atomistic manner of expression,
and begins to talk about pieces of space or pieces of duration, thus
adding an experience of relationships to that of qualities. But that
does not aﬀect the empiricist position in the slightest degree. Either
the piece of space is traversed and inspected by a mind, in which
1

The expression is Husserl’s. The idea is taken up with insight by M. Pradines, Philosophie
de la Sensation, I, particularly on pp. 152 and ﬀ.

‘association’ and the ‘projection of memories’

case empiricism is abandoned, since consciousness is no longer
deﬁned in terms of the impression; or else it is itself given in the
manner of an impression, when it becomes just as exclusive of
any more extensive co-ordination as the atomic impression ﬁrst
discussed.
The fact is that a shape is not only the sum of present data, for these
latter call up other complementary ones. When I say that I have before
me a red patch, the meaning of the word patch is provided by previous
experiences which have taught me the use of the word. The distribution in space of the three points A, B and C recalls other comparable
distributions, and I say that I see a circle. Nor does the appeal to
experience gained aﬀect the empiricist thesis. The ‘association of ideas’
which brings past experience into play can restore only extrinsic connections, and can be no more than one itself, because the original
experience involved no others. Once consciousness has been deﬁned as
sensation, every mode of consciousnees will have to derive its clarity
from sensation. The word circle, or the word order, could only signify, in
the earlier experiences to which I refer, the concrete manner in which
our sensations distributed themselves before us, a certain de facto
arrangement, a way of sensing (sentir). If the three points, A, B and C are
on a circle, the path AB ‘resembles’ the path BC, but this resemblance
means no more than that one path makes one think of the other. The
path ABC resembles other circular paths over which my eye has travelled, but that merely means that it recalls them and brings the image
of them to mind. It is never possible for two terms to be identiﬁed,
perceived or understood as the same, for that would presuppose that
their this-ness is overcome. They can only be indissolubly associated
and everywhere substituted for each other. Knowledge thus appears as
a system of substitutions in which one impression announces others
without ever justifying the announcement, in which words lead one to
expect sensations as evening leads one to expect night. The signiﬁcance
of the percept is nothing but a cluster of images which begin to
reappear without reason. The simplest images or sensations are, in the
last analysis, all that there is to understand in words, concepts being a
complicated way of designating them, and as they are themselves
inexpressible impressions, understanding is a fraud or an illusion.
Knowledge never has any hold on objects, which bring each other

17

18

phenomenology of perception

about, while the mind acts as a calculating machine,2 which has no
idea why its results are true. Sensation admits of no philosophy other
than that of nominalism, that is, the reduction of meaning to the
misinterpretation of vague resemblance or to the meaninglessness of
association by contiguity.
Now the sensation and images which are supposed to be the
beginning and end of all knowledge never make their appearance
anywhere other than within a horizon of meaning, and the signiﬁcance of the percept, far from resulting from an association, is in fact
presupposed in all association, whether it concerns the conspectus of
a ﬁgure before one, or the recollection of former experiences. Our
perceptual ﬁeld is made up of ‘things’ and ‘spaces between things’.3
The parts of a thing are not bound together by a merely external
association arising from their interrelatedness observed while the
object is in movement. For in the ﬁrst place I see, as things, groupings
which I have never seen in movement; houses, the sun, mountains,
for example. Whether or not it is insisted that I extend to static objects
a notion acquired through the experience of objects in motion, the
fact remains that the mountain must present in its actual appearance
some characteristic which gives ground for recognizing it as a thing,
and justiﬁes this transference. In which case the characteristic is sufﬁcient, without any such transference, to explain the segregation of
the perceptual ﬁeld. Even the unity of ordinary things, which a child
may handle and move about, does not amount to establishing their
substantiality. If we set ourselves to see as things the intervals between
them, the appearance of the world would be just as strikingly altered
as is that of the puzzle at the moment when I pick out ‘the rabbit’ or
‘the hunter’. There would not be simply the same elements diﬀerently
related, the same sensations diﬀerently associated, the same text
charged with a diﬀerent sense, the same matter in another form, but
in truth another world.
There are not arbitrary data which set about combining into a thing
because de facto proximities or likenesses cause them to associate; it is,
on the contrary, because we perceive a grouping as a thing that the

‘association’ and the ‘projection of memories’

analytical attitude can then discern likenesses or proximities. This does
not mean simply that without any perception of the whole we would
not think of noticing the resemblance or the contiguity of its elements,
but literally that they would not be part of the same world and would
not exist at all. The psychologist, who always conceives consciousness
as in the world, includes resemblance and contiguity of stimuli among
the objective conditions which bring about the grouping together of a
whole. The stimuli nearest to each other or most similar, he says,4 or
those which together endow the spectacle with the best balance, tend,
for perception, to unite into the same conﬁguration. But this way of
talking is misleading, because it confronts objective stimuli which
belong to the perceived world—and even to the second-order world
elaborated by scientiﬁc consciousness—with perceptual consciousness,
which it is the duty of psychology to describe according to direct
experience. The psychologist’s hybrid thinking always runs the risk of
reintroducing into the description relationships belonging to the
objective world. Thus it was possible to think of Wertheimer’s law of
contiguity and law of resemblance as bringing back the associationist’s
objective contiguity and resemblance in the rôle of constitutive principles of perception. In reality, for pure description—and Gestalt
theory claims to be a description—the contiguity and resemblance of
stimuli do not precede the constitution of the whole. ‘Good form’ is
not brought about because it would be good in itself in some metaphysical heaven; it is good form because it comes into being in our
experience. The alleged conditions of perception precede perception
itself only when, instead of describing the perceptual phenomenon as
the ﬁrst way of access to the object, we suppose round about it a setting
in which all disclosure of the implicit and all cross-checking performed by analytic perception are included, and all the norms of actual
perception vindicated—in short, a realm of truth, a world. In doing so
we relieve perception of its essential function, which is to lay the
foundations of, or inaugurate, knowledge, and we see it through its
results. If we conﬁne ourselves to phenomena, the unity of the thing
in perception is not arrived at by association, but is a condition of
4

form’).

19

20

phenomenology of perception

association, and as such precedes the delimitations which establish and
verify it, and indeed precedes itself.
If I walk along a shore towards a ship which has run aground, and
the funnel or masts merge into the forest bordering on the sand dune,
there will be a moment when these details suddenly become part of the
ship, and indissolubly fused with it. As I approached, I did not perceive
resemblances or proximities which ﬁnally came together to form a
continuous picture of the upper part of the ship. I merely felt that the
look of the object was on the point of altering, that something was
imminent in this tension, as a storm is imminent in storm clouds.
Suddenly the sight before me was recast in a manner satisfying to my
vague expectation. Only afterwards did I recognize, as justiﬁcations for
the change, the resemblance and contiguity of what I call ‘stimuli’—
namely the most determinate phenomena, seen at close quarters and
with which I compose the ‘true’ world. ‘How could I have failed to see
that these pieces of wood were an integral part of the ship? For they
were of the same colour as the ship, and ﬁtted well enough into its
superstructure.’ But these reasons for correct perception were not
given as reasons beforehand. The unity of the object is based on the
foreshadowing of an imminent order which is about to spring upon us
a reply to questions merely latent in the landscape. It solves a problem
set only in the form of a vague feeling of uneasiness, it organizes
elements which up to that moment did not belong to the same universe and which, for that reason, as Kant said with profound insight,
could not be associated. By placing them on the same footing, that of
the unique object, synopsis makes continuity and resemblance
between them possible. An impression can never by itself be associated
with another impression.
Nor has it the power to arouse others. It does so only provided that it
is already understood in the light of the past experience in which it coexisted with those which we are concerned to arouse. Imagine a set of
double syllables5 in which the second is a ‘softened’ rhyme of the ﬁrst
(tak-dak), and another set in which the second syllable has the letters of
the ﬁrst in reverse order (ged-deg); if the two sets have been learnt by
heart and if, in a critical experiment, the subject is given the uniform
5

‘association’ and the ‘projection of memories’

task of ‘ﬁnding a softened rhyme’, it is noticeable that he has more
diﬃculty in ﬁnding such a rhyme for ged than for a neutral syllable. But
if the task is to change the vowel in the syllables given, no delay occurs.
It could not, then, be powers of association which operated in the ﬁrst
experiment, for if they existed they ought to operate equally in the
second. The truth is that, faced with syllables often associated with
softened rhymes, the subject, instead of rhyming in reality, takes
advantage of what he knows, and sets in motion a ‘reproduction intention’,6 so that when he arrives at the second set of syllables, in which
the task is no longer related to the patterns with which he has been
trained to deal, the reproduction intention can lead only to mistakes.
When, in the second critical experiment, the subject is told to change
the vowel in the prompting syllable, as the task has never ﬁgured in the
preparatory drill, he cannot use the by-pass of reproduction, and under
these circumstances the preparatory drill has no eﬀect. Association
therefore never comes into play as an autonomous force; it is never the
word suggested which ‘induces’ the reply in the manner of an eﬃcient
cause; it acts only by making probable or attractive a reproduction
intention; it operates only in virtue of the meaning it has acquired in
the context of the former experience and in suggesting recourse to that
experience; it is eﬃcacious to the extent to which the subject recognizes it, and grasps it in the light or appearance of the past. If ﬁnally it
were desired to bring into operation, instead of simple continuity,
association by resemblance, it would still be seen that in order to recall
a former image which present perception resembles, the latter must be
patterned in such a way that it can sustain this resemblance. Whether a
subject7 has seen Figure 1 ﬁve or ﬁve hundred times he will recognize
it almost equally easily in Figure 2 where it appears ‘camouﬂaged’;
moreover he will never see it there constantly. On the other hand a
subject who is looking, in Figure 2, for another disguised ﬁgure (without knowing which one), rediscovers it there more quickly and more
frequently than a passive subject who is equally familiar with the
ﬁgures. Resemblance is, therefore, like co-existence in not being a force
so to speak in the third person, which directs a traﬃc of images or

‘states of consciousness’. Figure 1 is not recalled by Figure 2, or rather it
is so recalled only if one has ﬁrst seen in Figure 2 ‘a possible Figure 1’,
which amounts to saying that the actual resemblance does not relieve
us of the necessity of asking how it is ﬁrst made possible by the present
organization of Figure 2. The ‘prompting’ ﬁgure must take on the same
meaning as the induced ﬁgure before it can recall it, and ﬁnally the de
facto past is not imported into present perception by a mechanism of
association, but arrayed in present consciousness itself.
From this can be judged the worth of accepted formulas about ‘the
rôle of memories in perception’. Even outside empiricism there is talk
of ‘the contributions of memory’.8 People go on saying that ‘to perceive is to remember’. It is shown that in the reading of a book the
speed of the eye leaves gaps in the retinal impressions, therefore the
sense-data must be ﬁlled out by a projection of memories.9 A landscape
or newspaper seen upside down are said to represent our original view
of them, our normal view of them being now natural by reason of
what is added to it by memory. ‘Because of the unaccustomed
arrangement of impressions the inﬂuence of psychic causes can no
longer be felt.10 It is not asked why diﬀerently arranged impressions
make the newspaper unreadable or the landscape unrecognizable. The
answer is: because in order to ﬁll out perception, memories need to
have been made possible by the physiognomic character of the data.
Before any contribution by memory, what is seen must at the present
moment so organize itself as to present a picture to me in which I can

recognize my former experiences. Thus the appeal to memory presupposes what it is supposed to explain; the patterning of data, the
imposition of meaning on a chaos of sense-data. No sooner is the
recollection of memories made possible than it becomes superﬂuous,
since the work it is being asked to do is already done. The same may be
said of this ‘colouring of memory’ (Gedächtnisfarbe) which, in the opinion of other psychologists, eventually takes the place of the present
colour of objects, so that we see them ‘through the spectacles’ of
memory.11 The question is, what at this moment awakens the ‘colouring of memory’. It is recalled, says Hering, every time we see an object
we already know, ‘or believe we see it’. But on what basis have we this
belief? What is it, in present perception, which teaches us that we are
dealing with an already familiar object, since ex hypothesi its properties
are altered? If it is argued that recognition of shape or size is bound up
with that of colour, the argument is circular, since apparent size and
shape are also altered, and since recognition here too cannot result
from the recollection of memories, but must precede it. Nowhere then
does it work from past to present, and the ‘projection of memories’ is
nothing but a bad metaphor hiding a deeper, ready-made recognition.
In the same way, the illusion of the proofreader cannot be understood as the fusion of a few elements truthfully read oﬀ with memories
merging indistinguishably with them. How could the evocation of
memories come about unless guided by the look of the strictly visible
data, and if it is thus guided, what use is it then, since the word already
has its structure or its features before taking anything from the storehouse of memory? Obviously it is the analysis of illusions which has
lent credence to the ‘projection of memories’, and which follows
roughly this sketchy reasoning: illusory perception cannot rest upon
‘present data’, since I read ‘deduction’ when the word printed is
‘destruction’. The letter d, which has taken the place of the group str,
not being presented to the eye, must come from somewhere else. It is
then said to come from memory. In the same way in a ﬂat picture a few
patches of light and shade are enough to provide relief, a few branches
of a tree in a puzzle suggest a cat, several blurred lines in the clouds a
horse. But past experience can appear only afterwards as the cause of
11

Hering, Grundzüge der Lehre vom Lichtsinn, p. 8.

23

24

phenomenology of perception

the illusion, and the present experience has, in the ﬁrst place, to assume
form and meaning in order to recall precisely this memory and not
others. It is, then, before my eyes and at this moment that the horse, the
cat, the wrong word and the relief come into being. The light and
shade of the picture convey relief by imitating ‘the original phenomenon of relief ’,12 where they were invested with a basic spatial meaning. To enable me to ﬁnd a cat in the puzzle, it is necessary that ‘the
meaning-unit “cat” should in some way prescribe those elements of
the picture which the coordinating activity is to retain and those which
it is to overlook’.13 Illusion deceives us, and passes itself oﬀ as genuine
perception precisely in those cases where the meaning originates in the
source of sensation and nowhere else. It imitates that privileged experience in which the meaning exactly ﬁts the sensation, clearly cohering,
or being evinced, in it. It implies this norm of perception, and therefore cannot spring from any contact between sensation and memory,
and this is even more true of perception. The ‘projection of memories’
makes nonsense of both. For if a thing perceived were made up of
sensations and memories, it would depend for its precise identiﬁcation
on the contribution of memories, and would have in itself nothing
capable of stemming the ﬂood of the latter, with the result that, being
deprived even of that outer fringe of vagueness which it always in fact
has, it would be, as we have said, intangible, elusive, and always bordering on illusion. Illusion would, a fortiori, never present the ﬁrm and
well-deﬁned appearance which a thing eventually assumes, since perception itself would not have it, and so illusion would not mislead us. If
ﬁnally it is conceded that memories do not by themselves project
themselves upon sensations, but that consciousness compares them
with the present data, retaining only those which accord with them,
then one is admitting an original text which carries its meaning within
itself, and setting it over against that of memories: this original text is
perception itself. In short, it is a mistake to think that with the ‘projection of memories’ we are bringing into perception some mental activity, and that we have taken up a position opposed to that of empiricism.
The theory is no more than a consequence, a tardy and ineﬀective
12

‘association’ and the ‘projection of memories’

correction of empiricism, accepting its postulates, sharing the same
diﬃculties and, like empiricism, concealing phenomena instead of
elucidating them.
The postulate, as always, consists in deducing the given from what
happens to be furnished by the sense organs. For example, in the
illusion of proofreaders, the elements actually seen are reconstituted
according to the eye movements, the speed of reading and the time
needed for the retinal impression. Then, by subtracting these theoretical data from total perception, the ‘recollected elements’ are
obtained which, in turn, are treated as mental entities. Perception is
built up with states of consciousness as a house is built with bricks, and
a mental chemistry is invoked which fuses these materials into a compact whole. Like all empiricist theories, this one describes only blind
processes which could never be the equivalent of knowledge, because
there is, in this mass of sensations and memories, nobody who sees,
nobody who can appreciate the falling into line of datum and recollection, and, on the other hand, no solid object protected by a meaning
against the teeming horde of memories. We must then discard this
postulate which obscures the whole question. The cleavage between
given and remembered, arrived at by way of objective causes, is arbitrary. When we come back to phenomena we ﬁnd, as a basic layer of
experience, a whole already pregnant with an irreducible meaning: not
sensations with gaps between them, into which memories may be
supposed to slip, but the features, the layout of a landscape or a word,
in spontaneous accord with the intentions of the moment, as with
earlier experience.
It is at this stage that the real problem of memory in perception
arises, in association with the general problem of perceptual consciousness. We want to know how, by its own vitality, and without
carrying complementary material into a mythical unconscious, consciousness can, in course of time, modify the structure of its surroundings; how, at every moment, its former experience is present to it in the
form of a horizon which it can reopen—‘if it chooses to take that
horizon as a theme of knowledge’—in an act of recollection, but
which it can equally leave on the fringe of experience, and which then
immediately provides the perceived with a present atmosphere and
signiﬁcance. A ﬁeld which is always at the disposal of consciousness

25

26

phenomenology of perception

and one which, for that very reason, surrounds and envelops its perceptions, an atmosphere, a horizon or, if you will, given ‘sets’ which
provide it with a temporal situation, such is the way in which the past
is present, making distinct acts of perception and recollection possible.
To perceive is not to experience a host of impressions accompanied by
memories capable of clinching them; it is to see, standing forth from a
cluster of data, an immanent signiﬁcance without which no appeal to
memory is possible. To remember is not to bring into the focus of
consciousness a self-subsistent picture of the past; it is to thrust deeply
into the horizon of the past and take apart step by step the interlocked
perspectives until the experiences which it epitomizes are as if relived
in their temporal setting. To perceive is not to remember.
The relationships ‘ﬁgure’ and ‘background’, ‘thing’ and ‘nothing’,
and the horizon of the past appear, then, to be structures of consciousness irreducible to the qualities which appear in them. Empiricism will
always retain the expedient of treating this a priori as if it were the
product of some mental chemistry. The empiricist will concede that
every object is presented against a background which is not an object,
the present lying between two horizons of absence, past and future.
But, he will go on, these signiﬁcations are derivative. The ‘ﬁgure’ and
the ‘background’, the ‘thing’ and its ‘surrounding’, the ‘present’ and
the ‘past’, are words which summarize the experience of a spatiotemporal perspective, which in the end comes down to the elimination
either of memory or of the marginal impressions. Even though, once
formed in actual perception, structures have more meaning than can be
supplied by a quality, I am not entitled to regard this evidence of
consciousness as adequate; I must reconstruct theoretically these structures with the aid of the impressions whose actual relationships they
express. On this footing empiricism cannot be refuted. Since it rejects
the evidence of reﬂection and produces, by associating external
impressions, the structures which we are conscious of understanding
by proceeding from the whole to its parts, there is no phenomenon
which can be adduced as a crucial proof against it. Generally speaking,
the description of phenomena does not enable one to refute thought
which is not alive to its own existence, and which resides in things. The
physicist’s atoms will always appear more real than the historical and
qualitative face of the world, the physico-chemical processes more real

‘association’ and the ‘projection of memories’

than the organic forms, the psychological atoms of empiricism more
real than perceived phenomena, the intellectual atoms represented by
the ‘signiﬁcations’ of the Vienna Circle more real than consciousness,
as long as the attempt is made to build up the shape of the world (life,
perception, mind) instead of recognizing, as the source which stares
us in the face and as the ultimate court of appeal in our knowledge
of these things, our experience of them. The adoption of this new way of
looking at things, which reverses the relative positions of the clear and
the obscure, must be undertaken by each one for himself, whereupon
it will be seen to be justiﬁed by the abundance of phenomena which it
elucidates. Before its discovery, these phenomena were inaccessible, yet
to the description given of them empiricism can always retort that it
does not understand. In this sense, reﬂection is a system of thought no less
closed than insanity, with this diﬀerence that it understands itself and
the madman too, whereas the madman does not understand it. But
though the phenomenal ﬁeld may indeed be a new world, it is never
totally overlooked by natural thought, being present as its horizon, and
the empiricist doctrine itself is an attempt to analyse consciousness. By
way of guarding against myths it is, then, desirable to point out everything that is made incomprehensible by empiricist constructions and
all the basic phenomena which they conceal. They hide from us in the
ﬁrst place ‘the cultural world’ or ‘human world’ in which nevertheless
almost our whole life is led. For most of us, Nature is no more than a
vague and remote entity, overlaid by cities, roads, houses and above all
by the presence of other people. Now, for empiricism, ‘cultural’ objects
and faces owe their distinctive form, their magic power, to transference
and projection of memory, so that only by accident has the human
world any meaning. There is nothing in the appearance of a landscape,
an object or a body whereby it is predestined to look ‘gay’ or ‘sad’,
‘lively’ or ‘dreary’, ‘elegant’ or ‘coarse’. Once more seeking a deﬁnition of what we perceive through the physical and chemical properties
of the stimuli which may act upon our sensory apparatus, empiricism
excludes from perception the anger or the pain which I nevertheless
read in a face, the religion whose essence I seize in some hesitation or
reticence, the city whose temper I recognize in the attitude of a
policeman or the style of a public building. There can no longer be any
objective spirit: mental life withdraws into isolated consciousness devoted

solely to introspection, instead of extending, as it apparently does in
fact, over human space which is made up by those with whom I argue
or live, ﬁlling my place of work or the abode of my happiness. Joy and
sadness, vivacity and obtuseness are data of introspection, and when
we invest landscapes or other people with these states, it is because we
have observed in ourselves the coincidence between these internal perceptions and the external signs associated with them by the accidents
of our constitution. Perception thus impoverished becomes purely a
matter of knowledge, a progressive noting down of qualities and of
their most habitual distribution, and the perceiving subject approaches
the world as the scientist approaches his experiments. If on the other
hand we admit that all these ‘projections’, all these ‘associations’, all
these ‘transferences’ are based on some intrinsic characteristic of the
object, the ‘human world’ ceases to be a metaphor and becomes once
more what it really is, the seat and as it were the homeland of our
thoughts. The perceiving subject ceases to be an ‘acosmic’ thinking
subject, and action, feeling and will remain to be explored as original
ways of positing an object, since ‘an object looks attractive or repulsive
before it looks black or blue, circular or square’.14
But not only does empiricism distort experience by making the
cultural world an illusion, when in fact it is in it that our existence ﬁnds
its sustenance. The natural world is also falsiﬁed, and for the same
reasons. What we object to in empiricism is not its having taken this as
its primary theme of analysis. For it is quite true that every cultural
object refers back to a natural background against which it appears and
which may, moreover, be confused and remote. Our perception senses
how near is the canvas underneath the picture, or the crumbling
cement under the building, or the tiring actor under the character. But
the nature about which empiricism talks is a collection of stimuli and
qualities, and it is ridiculous to pretend that nature thus conceived is,
even in intention merely, the primary object of our perception: it does
in fact follow the experience of cultural objects, or rather it is one of
them. We shall, therefore, have to rediscover the natural world too, and
its mode of existence, which is not to be confused with that of the
scientiﬁc object. The phenomenon of the background’s continuing
14

‘association’ and the ‘projection of memories’

under the ﬁgure, and being seen under the ﬁgure—when in fact it is
covered by the ﬁgure—a phenomenon which embraces the whole
problem of the presence of the object, is equally obscured by empiricist
philosophy, which treats this covered part of the background as invisible (in virtue of a physiological deﬁnition of vision) and brings it
down to the status of a mere sensible quality by supposing that it is
provided by an image, that is, by a watered-down sensation. In more
general terms, the real objects which are not part of our visual ﬁeld can
be present to us only as images, and that is why they are no more than
‘permanent possibilities of sensations’. If we abandon the empiricist
postulate of the priority of contents, we are free to recognize the
strange mode of existence enjoyed by the object behind our back. The
hysterical child who turns round ‘to see if the world behind him is still
there’,15 suﬀers from no deﬁciency of images, but the perceived world
has lost for him that original structure which ensures that for the
normal person its hidden aspects are as indubitable as are its visible
ones. Once again the empiricist can always build up, with psychic
atoms, near equivalents of all these structures. But the inventory of the
perceived world given in the following chapters will increasingly show
it up as a kind of mental blindness, and as the system least able to give
an inclusive account of experience as it is revealed to us, while on the
other hand reﬂection embraces empiricism’s subordinate truth and
assigns to it its proper place.

‘ATTENTION’ AND
‘JUDGEMENT’
The discussion of traditional prejudices has so far been directed against
empiricism, but in fact it was not empiricism alone that we were
attacking. We must now show that its intellectualist antithesis is on the
same level as empiricism itself. Both take the objective world as the
object of their analysis, when this comes ﬁrst neither in time nor in
virtue of its meaning; and both are incapable of expressing the peculiar
way in which perceptual consciousness constitutes its object. Both
keep their distance in relation to perception, instead of sticking closely
to it.
This may be shown by studying the history of the concept of attention. It is deduced, in empiricist thinking, from the ‘constancy hypothesis’, or, as we have explained, from the priority of the objective world.
Even if what we perceive does not correspond to the objective properties of the source of the stimulus, the constancy hypothesis forces us to
admit that the ‘normal sensations’ are already there. They must then be
unperceived, and the function which reveals them, as a searchlight
shows up objects pre-existing in the darkness, is called attention. Attention, then, creates nothing, and it is a natural miracle, as Malebranche
to all intents and purposes said, which strikes up like sparks just those
perceptions or ideas capable of providing an answer to the questions

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

which I was asking. Since ‘bemerken’ or taking notice is not an eﬃcient
cause of the ideas which this act arouses, it is the same in all acts of
attention, just as the searchlight’s beam is the same whatever landscape
be illuminated. Attention is therefore a general and unconditioned
power in the sense that at any moment it can be applied indiﬀerently to
any content of consciousness. Being everywhere barren, nowhere can it
have its own purposes to fulﬁl. In order to relate it to the life of
consciousness, one would have to show how a perception awakens
attention, then how attention develops and enriches it. Some internal
connection would have to be described, and empiricism has at its
disposal only external ones, and can do no more than juxtapose states
of consciousness. The empiricist’s subject, once he has been allowed
some initiative—which is the justiﬁcation for a theory of attention—
can receive only absolute freedom. Intellectualism, on the other hand,
starts with the fruitfulness of attention: since I am conscious that
through attention I shall come by the truth of the object, the succession
of pictures called up by attention is not a haphazard one. The new
appearance of the object assigns to the previous one a subordinate
place, and expresses all that its predecessor was trying to communicate.
The wax is from the start a fragment of extension both pliable and
alterable; I simply realize this clearly or confusedly ‘according as my
attention is applied more or less to the things which are in it and of
which it is composed’.1 Since in attention I experience an elucidation of
the object, the perceived object must already contain the intelligible
structure which it reveals. If consciousness ﬁnds a geometrical circle in
the circular form of a plate, it is because it had already put the circle
there. For it to gain possession of the knowledge brought by attention,
it is enough for it to come to itself again, in the sense in which a man is
said to come to himself again after fainting. On the other hand, inattentive or delirious perception is a semi-torpor, describable only in terms
of negations, its object has no consistency, the only objects about
which one can speak being those of waking consciousness. It is true
that we carry with us, in the shape of our body, an ever-present principle of absent-mindedness and bewilderment. But our body has not

1

31

32

phenomenology of perception

the power to make us see what is not there; it can only make us believe
that we see it. The moon on the horizon is not, and is not seen to be,
bigger than at its zenith: if we look at it attentively, for example
through a cardboard tube or a telescope, we see that its apparent
diameter remains constant.2 Inattentive perception contains nothing
more and indeed nothing other than the attentive kind. So philosophy
need attach no importance to any credit which appearance may be
thought to enjoy. Clear consciousness, freed from the obstacles which
it was prepared to create, the real world purged of any admixture of
daydreams, are there for everyone. We are not called upon to analyse
the act of attention as a passage from indistinctness to clarity, because
the indistinctness is not there. Consciousness does not begin to exist
until it sets limits to an object, and even the phantoms of ‘internal
experience’ are possible only as things borrowed from external experience. Therefore consciousness has no private life, and the only obstacle
it encounters is chaos, which is nothing. But, in a consciousness which
constitutes everything, or rather which eternally possesses the intelligible structure of all its objects, just as in empiricist consciousness
which constitutes nothing at all, attention remains an abstract and
ineﬀective power, because it has no work to perform. Consciousness is
no less intimately linked with objects of which it is unheeding than
with those which interest it, and the additional clearness brought by
the act of attention does not herald any new relationship. It therefore
becomes once more a light which does not change its character with
the various objects which it shines upon, and once more empty acts of
attention are brought in, in place of ‘the modes and speciﬁc directions
of intention’.3 Finally, the act of attention is unconditioned, for it has
all objects at its disposal, as was the ‘bemerken’ of the empiricists,
because in relation to that all objects were transcendent. How could an
object, distinguished by its presence, call forth an act of attention, since
consciousness includes all objects? Where empiricism was deﬁcient
was in any internal connection between the object and the act which it
triggers oﬀ. What intellectualism lacks is contingency in the occasions
of thought. In the ﬁrst case consciousness is too poor, in the second too

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

rich for any phenomenon to appeal compellingly to it. Empiricism
cannot see that we need to know what we are looking for, otherwise we would not be looking for it, and intellectualism fails to see that
we need to be ignorant of what we are looking for, or equally again
we should not be searching. They are in agreement in that neither
can grasp consciousness in the act of learning, and that neither attaches
due importance to that circumscribed ignorance, that still ‘empty’
but already determinate intention which is attention itself. Whether
attention gets what it wants by ever-renewed miracles or whether it
possesses it in advance, in both cases silence is maintained over the
production of the object. Whether it be a collection of qualities or a
system of relationships, no sooner does it exist than it must be pure,
transparent, impersonal—not imperfect—a truth for one moment of
my life and of my knowledge as it emerges into consciousness.
Perceptual consciousness is confused with the exact forms of scientiﬁc consciousness and the indeterminate does not enter into the
deﬁnition of the mind. In spite of the intentions of intellectualism,
the two doctrines, then, have this idea in common that attention
creates nothing, since a world of impressions in itself or a universe
of determining thought are equally independent of the action of
mind.
Against this conception of an inactive subject, the analysis of attention by the psychologists acquires the value of self-discovery, and the
criticism of the ‘constancy hypothesis’ develops into a criticism of the
dogmatic belief in the ‘world’ seen as a reality in itself by empiricists,
and as the immanent end of knowledge by intellectualists. Attention
ﬁrst of all presupposes a transformation of the mental ﬁeld, a new way
for consciousness to be present to its objects. Take the act of attention
whereby I locate a point on my body which is being touched. The
analysis of certain disorders having their origin in the central nervous
system, and which make such an identiﬁcation impossible, reveals the
profound workings of consciousness. Head has spoken summarily of ‘a
local weakening of attention’. It is in reality neither a question of one or
more ‘local signals’, nor of the collapse of a secondary power of apprehension. The primary condition of the disorder is a disintegration of
the sensory ﬁeld which no longer remains stable while the subject
perceives, but moves in response to the exploratory movements and

33

34

phenomenology of perception

shrinks while it is being probed.4 A vaguely located spot, contradictory
phenomenon that reveals a pre-objective space where there is indeed
extension, since several points on the body touched together are not
confused by the subject, but as yet no univocal position, because no
spatial framework persists from one perception to another. The ﬁrst
operation of attention is, then, to create for itself a ﬁeld, either perceptual
or mental, which can be ‘surveyed’ (überschauen), in which movements
of the exploratory organ or elaborations of thought are possible, but in
which consciousness does not correspondingly lose what it has gained
and, moreover, lose itself in the changes it brings about. The precise
position of the point touched will be the invariable factor among the
various feelings that I experience according to the dispositions of my
limbs and body. The act of attention can localize or objectify this invariable factor because it has stepped back from the changes of appearance.
Attention, therefore, as a general and formal activity, does not exist.5
There is in each case a certain liberty to be acquired, and a certain
mental space to make the most of. It remains to bring to light the object
of attention itself. There it is literally a question of creation. For
example, it has long been known that during the ﬁrst nine months of
life, infants distinguish only globally the coloured from the colourless;
thereafter coloured areas form into ‘warm’ and ‘cold’ shades, and
ﬁnally the detailed colours are arrived at. But psychologists6 would
concede here no more than that ignorance or the confusion of names
prevents the child from distinguishing colours. The child must, it was
alleged, see green where it is; all he was failing to do was to pay attention
and apprehend his own phenomena. The reason for these assertions
was that psychologists were not yet able to conceive a world in which
colours were indeterminate, or a colour which was not a precise quality. The criticism of these prejudices, on the other hand, allows the
world of colours to be perceived as a secondary formation, based on a
series of ‘physiognomic’ distinctions: that between the ‘warm’ and
‘cold’ shades, that between the ‘coloured’ and the ‘non-coloured’. We

cannot compare these phenomena, which take the place of colour in
children, to any determinate quality, and in the same way the
‘strange’ colours seen by a diseased person cannot be identiﬁed with
any colour of the spectrum.7 The ﬁrst perception of colours properly
speaking, then, is a change of the structure of consciousness,8 the
establishment of a new dimension of experience, the setting forth of
an a priori.
Now attention has to be conceived on the model of these primary
acts, since secondary attention, which would be limited to recalling
knowledge already gained, would once more identify it with acquisition. To pay attention is not merely further to elucidate pre-existing
data, it is to bring about a new articulation of them by taking them as
ﬁgures.9 They are preformed only as horizons, they constitute in reality
new regions in the total world. It is precisely the original structure
which they introduce that brings out the identity of the object before
and after the act of attention. Once the colour-quality is acquired,
and only by means of it, do the previous data appear as preparations of
this quality. Once the idea of an equation has been acquired, equal
arithmetical quantities appear as varieties of the same equation. It is
precisely by overthrowing data that the act of attention is related to
previous acts, and the unity of consciousness is thus built up step by
step through a ‘transition-synthesis’. The miracle of consciousness
consists in its bringing to light, through attention, phenomena which
re-establish the unity of the object in a new dimension at the very
moment when they destroy it. Thus attention is neither an association
of images, nor the return to itself of thought already in control of its
objects, but the active constitution of a new object which makes
explicit and articulate what was until then presented as no more than
an indeterminate horizon. At the same time as it sets attention in
motion, the object is at every moment recaptured and placed once
more in a state of dependence on it. It gives rise to the ‘knowledgebringing event’, which is to transform it, only by means of the still
ambiguous meaning which it requires that event to clarify; it is

therefore the motive10 and not the cause of the event. But at least the act
of attention is rooted in the life of consciousness, and one can ﬁnally
understand how it emerges from its liberty of indiﬀerence and gives
itself a present object. This passage from the indeterminate to the
determinate, this recasting at every moment of its own history in the
unity of a new meaning, is thought itself. ‘The work of the mind exists
only in act.’11 The result of the act of attention is not to be found in its
beginning. If the moon on the horizon appears to me no bigger than at
the zenith, when I look at it through a telescope or a cardboard tube,
the conclusion12 cannot be drawn that in free vision equally its appearance is invariable. This is what empiricism believes, because it is not
concerned with what we see, but with what we ought to see, according
to the retinal image. It is also what intellectualism believes because it
describes de facto perception according to the data of ‘analytic’ and
attentive perception, in which the moon in fact resumes its true apparent diameter. The precise and entirely determinate world is still posited
in the ﬁrst place, no longer perhaps as the cause of our perceptions, but
as their immanent end. If the world is to be possible, it must be implied
in the ﬁrst adumbration of consciousness, as the transcendental deduction so forcibly brings out.13 And that is why the moon on the horizon
should never appear bigger than it is. Psychological reﬂection, on the
contrary, makes us put the world of the exact back into its cradle of
consciousness, and ask how the very idea of the world or of exact truth
is possible, and look for its ﬁrst appearance in consciousness. When I
look quite freely and naturally, the various parts of the ﬁeld interact
and motivate this enormous moon on the horizon, this measureless size
which nevertheless is a size. Consciousness must be faced with its own
unreﬂective life in things and awakened to its own history which it was
forgetting: such is the true part that philosophical reﬂection has to play,
and thus do we arrive at a true theory of attention.

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

Intellectualism set out, it is true, to discover by reﬂection the structure of perception, instead of explaining it in terms of a combination
of associative forces and attention, but its gaze upon perception is not
yet direct. This will be seen better by examining the rôle played in its
analysis by the notion of judgement. Judgement is often introduced as
what sensation lacks to make perception possible. Sensation is no longer presupposed as a real element of consciousness. But when it is desired to
delineate the structure of perception, it is done by joining up the
points of sensation. Analysis is then dominated by this empiricist
notion which, however, is accepted only as the boundary of consciousness and serves merely to throw into relief a power of co-ordination of
which it is itself the antithesis. Intellectualism thrives on the refutation
of empiricism, and here judgement often has the job of oﬀsetting
the possible dispersal of sensations.14 Analytical reﬂection makes its
position ﬁrm by carrying to their logical conclusions the realist and
empiricist theses, and validating their opposite by showing their
absurdity. But in the reductio ad absurdum no contact is necessarily made
with the actual workings of consciousness. It remains possible that the
theory of perception, ideally starting from a blind intuition, may end
compensatorily with some empty concept, and that judgement, the
counterpart of pure sensation, may degenerate into a general function
of an indiﬀerent linking of objects, or even become once more a psychic force detectable in its eﬀects. The famous analysis of the piece of
wax jumps from qualities such a smell, colour and taste, to the power
of assuming an inﬁnity of forms and positions, a power which lies
beyond the perceived object and deﬁnes only the wax of the physicist.
For perception there is no wax left when all its sensible properties have
vanished, and only science supposes that there is some matter which is
preserved. The ‘perceived’ wax itself, with its original manner of existing, its permanence which is not yet the exact identity of science, its
‘interior horizon’15 of possible variation of shape and size, its dull
colour suggestive of softness, which in turn suggests the dull sound I
shall get when I pat it, in short, the perceptual structure of the object,

are lost sight of, because speciﬁcations of a predicative kind are needed
to link up objective and hermetically sealed qualities. The men I see
from a window are hidden by their hats and coats, and their image
cannot be imprinted on my retina. I therefore do not see them, I judge
them to be there.16 Once vision is deﬁned in the empiricist way as the
possession of a quality impressed upon the body by the stimulus,17 the
least illusion, endowing the object as it does with properties which it
does not possess on my retina, is suﬃcient to establish that perception
is a judgement.18 As I have two eyes, I ought to see the object double,
and if I see only one of it, that is because I construct by means of two
images the idea of one object a distance away.19 Perception becomes an

Descartes, 2nd Meditation, ‘I do not fail to say that I see men, just as I say I see wax; yet
what do I see from the window, except hats and coats which may cover ghosts or

‘Here too relief seems obvious; yet it is concluded from an appearance which bears no
resemblance to a relief, namely from a diﬀerence between the appearances presented to
our two eyes by the same things.’ Alain, Quatre-vingt-un chapitres sur l’esprit et les passions, p. 19.
Moreover Alain (ibid., p. 17) refers to the Physiological Optics of Helmholz in which the
constancy hypothesis is always assumed, and where judgement intervenes only to ﬁll the
gaps in physiological explanation. Cf. again ibid., p. 23, ‘It is fairly obvious that in the
case of this forest horizon, sight presents it to us not as remote but as bluish, by reason of
the intervening layers of air.’ This is logically entailed if we deﬁne sight by its bodily
stimulus or by the possession of a quality, for then it can give us blueness but not
distance, which is a relationship. But it is not strictly speaking obvious, that is, attested
by consciousness. Consciousness is in fact astonished to discover in the perception of
distance relations which precede all assessment, calculation or conclusion.

‘What proves here that I judge is that painters know perfectly how to provide me with
the perception of a distant mountain by imitating its appearance on a canvas.’ Alain,
ibid., p. 14.

‘We see objects double because we have two eyes, but we pay no attention to these
double images except in order to gain from them knowledge about the distance or relief
of the unique object which they aﬀord our perception.’ Lagneau, Célèbres Leçons, p. 105.
And generally ‘we must ﬁrst of all look for the elementary sensations which belong to the
nature of the human mind; the human body represents this nature’. Ibid., p. 75. ‘I have
met a person’, says Alain, ‘who was not prepared to admit that our eyes present us with
two images of each thing; it is, however, suﬃcient to ﬁx our eyes on a fairly close object
such as a pencil to see that the images of distant objects are immediately doubled.’
(Quatre-vingt-un chapitres, pp. 23–4.) That does not prove that they were double beforehand.
Here can be seen the prejudice in favour of the law of constancy which demands that
phenomena corresponding to bodily impressions be given in places where they are not
observed.

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

‘interpretation’ of the signs that our senses provide in accordance with
the bodily stimuli,20 a ‘hypothesis’ that the mind evolves to ‘explain its
impressions to itself.’21 But judgement also, brought in to explain the
excess of perception over the retinal impressions, instead of being the
act of perception itself grasped from within by authentic reﬂection,
becomes once more a mere ‘factor’ of perception, responsible for
providing what the body does not provide—instead of being a transcendental activity, it becomes simply a logical activity of drawing a
conclusion.22 In this way we are drawn away from reﬂection, and we
construct perception instead of revealing its distinctive working; we
miss once more the basic operation which infuses meaning (sens) into
the sensible, and which is taken for granted by any logical mediation or
any psychological causality. The result is that intellectualist analysis
eventually makes nonsense of the perceptual phenomena which it is
designed to elucidate. While judgement loses its constitutive function
and becomes an explanatory principle, the words ‘see’, ‘hear’, ‘feel’
lose all their meaning, since the least signiﬁcant vision outruns the
pure impression and thus comes under the general heading of ‘judgement’. Ordinary experience draws a clear distinction between sense
experience and judgement. It sees judgement as the taking of a stand,
as an eﬀort to know something which shall be valid for myself every
moment of my life, and equally for other actual or potential minds;
sense experience, on the contrary, is taking appearance at its face value,
without trying to possess it and learn its truth. This distinction disappears in intellectualism, because judgement is everywhere where pure
sensation is not—that is, absolutely everywhere. The evidence of
phenomena will therefore everywhere be challenged.
A large cardboard box seems heavier to me than a small one made of
the same cardboard, and if I conﬁned myself to phenomena I should
say that in advance. I feel it heavier in my hand. But intellectualism limits
sense experience to the action of a real stimulus on my body. Since here

there is none, we have to say that the box is not felt but judged to be
heavier, and this example which seemed ready-made to show the sensory aspect of illusion serves on the contrary to prove that there is no
sensory knowledge, and that we feel as we judge.23 A cube drawn on
paper changes its appearance according as it is seen from one side and
from above or from the other and from below. Even if I know that it can
be seen in two ways, the ﬁgure in fact refuses to change its structure
and my knowledge must await its intuitive realization. Here again one
ought to conclude that judging is not perceiving. But the alternatives of
sensation and judgement force us to say that the change in the ﬁgure,
since it does not depend on the ‘sensible elements’ which, like the
stimuli, remain constant, can only depend on a change of interpretation, and that ‘the mind’s conception modiﬁes perception itself ’,24
‘appearance assumes form and meaning to order’.25 Now if we see
what we judge, how can we distinguish between true and false perception? How will it then be possible to say that the suﬀerer from hallucinations or the madman ‘think they see what they do not see’?26
Where will be the diﬀerence between ‘seeing’ and ‘thinking one sees’?
If the reply is made that the sane man judges only by adequate signs
and completely coherent material, it is, then, because there is a diﬀerence between the motivated judgement of veridical perception and the
empty judgement of false perception. And as the diﬀerence is not in
the form of the judgement but in the sensible text to which it gives
form, to perceive in the full sense of the word (as the antithesis of
imagining) is not to judge, it is to apprehend an immanent sense in the
sensible before judgement begins. The phenomenon of true perception
oﬀers, therefore, a meaning inherent in the signs, and of which
judgement is merely the optional expression. Intellectualism can make
comprehensible neither this phenomenon nor the imitation which
illusion gives of it. More generally it is blind to the mode of existence
and co-existence of perceived objects, to the life which steals across the
visual ﬁeld and secretly binds its parts together. In Zöllner’s optical
illusion, I ‘see’ the main lines converging. Intellectualism simply

reduces the phenomenon to a mistake, saying that it all comes of my
bringing in the auxiliary lines and their relation to the main ones,
instead of comparing their main lines themselves. Basically I mistake
the task given to me, and I compare the two wholes instead of comparing the principal elements.27 My mistake apparently remains
unexplained. The question ought to arise: How does it come about that
it is so diﬃcult in Zöllner’s illusion to compare in isolation the very
lines that have to be compared according to the task set? Why do they
thus refuse to be separated from the auxiliary lines?28 It should be
recognized that acquiring auxiliary lines, the main lines have ceased to
be parallel, that they have lost that meaning and acquired another, that
the auxiliary lines introduce into the ﬁgure a new meaning which
henceforth clings to it and cannot be shifted.29 It is this meaning
inseparable from the ﬁgure, this transformation of the phenomenon,
which motivates the false judgement and which is so to speak behind it.
It is at the same time this meaning which gives a sense to the word ‘see’
on the hither side of judgement and on the far side of the quality or
impression, and causes the problem of perception to reappear. If we
agree to call any perception of a relationship a judgement and to keep
the term visual impression for the atomic impression, then certainly
illusion is a judgement. But this analysis presupposes at least in theory a
layer of impressions in which the main lines are parallel, as they are in
the world, that is, in the physical environment which we measure—
and a second-order operation which changes the impressions by
bringing in auxiliary lines, thus distorting the relationships of the
principal lines. Now the ﬁrst of these phases is purely conjectural, and
with it the judgement which produces the second. We construct the
illusion, but we do not understand it. Judgement in this very general
and quite formal sense explains perception, true or false, only when it
is guided by the spontaneous organization and the special mode of

rectangle has an inner and an outer face, the isolated line on the other hand has two faces
absolutely equivalent.’

arrangement of the phenomena. It is true that the illusion consists in
involving the principal elements in the ﬁgure in auxiliary relationships
which break up the parallelism. But why do they break it up? Why is it
that two straight lines so far parallel cease to make a pair and begin to
converge by reason of the immediate surroundings provided? It is as if
they no longer belonged to the same world. Two genuinely oblique
lines are situated in the same space which is objective space. But these
do not actually converge upon each other, and it is impossible to see
them in this way if our eyes are ﬁxed on them. It is when we look away
from them that they move insidiously towards this new relationship.
There is here, preceding objective relationships, a perceptual syntax
constructed according to its own rules: the breaking of old relationships and the establishment of new ones—judgement—express merely
the result of this complex operation and place it on record. True or
false, in this way must perception ﬁrst be constituted for predication to
be possible. It is quite true that the distance from us of an object, or its
relief, are not properties of the object as are its colour or its weight. It is
true that they are relations introduced into a total grouping which,
moreover, includes weight and colour. But it is untrue that this grouping is eﬀected through an ‘inspection of the mind’. It would follow
from this that the mind runs over isolated impressions and gradually
discovers the meaning of the whole as the scientist discovers the
unknown factors in virtue of the data of the problem. Now here the
data of the problem are not prior to its solution, and perception is just
that act which creates at a stroke, along with the cluster of data, the
meaning which unites them—indeed which not only discovers the
meaning which they have, but moreover sees to it that they have a meaning.
It is true that these criticism are valid only against the ﬁrst stages of
analytical reﬂection, and intellectualism might reply that one is forced
at the beginning to talk the language of common sense. The conception
of judgement as a psychic force or a logical mediator, and the theory of
perception as ‘interpretation’—the intellectualism of the
psychologists—is indeed simply a counterpart of empiricism, but it
paves the way to true self-discovery. One can begin only with a natural
attitude, complete with its postulates, until the internal dialectic of
these postulates destroys them. Once perception is understood as
interpretation, sensation, which has provided a starting-point, is ﬁnally

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

superseded, for all perceptual consciousness is already beyond it. The
sensation is not experienced,30 and consciousness is always consciousness of an object. We arrive at sensation when we think about perceptions and try to make it clear that they are not completely our work.
Pure sensation, deﬁned as the action of stimuli on our body, is the ‘last
eﬀect’ of knowledge, particularly of scientiﬁc knowledge, and it is an
illusion (a not unnatural one, moreover) that causes us to put it at the
beginning and to believe that it precedes knowledge. It is the necessary,
and necessarily misleading way in which a mind sees its own history.31
It belongs to the domain of the constituted and not to the constituting
mind. To the world or opinion, perception can appear as an interpretation. For consciousness itself, how could it be a process of reasoning
since there are no sensations to provide it with premises, or an interpretation, because there is nothing prior to it to interpret? At the same
time as we thus discard, along with the idea of sensation, that of a
purely logical activity, our foregoing objections disappear. We asked
what seeing or feeling are, what makes this knowledge still enmeshed
in its object, and inherent in one point of time and space, distinct from
the concept. But reﬂection shows that there is nothing here to understand. It is a fact that I believe myself to be ﬁrst of all surrounded by my
body, involved in the world, situated here and now. But each of these
words, when I come to think about them, is devoid of meaning, and
therefore raises no problem: would I perceive myself as ‘surrounded by
my body’ if I were not in it as well as being in myself, if I did not myself
conceive this spatial relationship and thus escape inherence at the very
instant at which I conceive it? Would I know that I am caught up and
situated in the world, if I were truly caught up and situated in it? I
should then merely be where I was, as a thing, and since I know where
I am and see myself among things, it is because I am a consciousness,
a strange creature which resides nowhere and can be everywhere
present in intention. Everything that exists exists as a thing or as a

‘When we have evolved this notion by scientiﬁc knowledge and reﬂection, we think
that what is in fact the last eﬀect of the process of knowing, namely the expression of the
relationship between one being and others, is the beginning; but this is an illusion.

construction of the mind.’ Id. ibid.

consciousness, and there is no half-way house. The thing is in a place,
but perception is nowhere, for if it were situated in a place it could not
make other things exist for itself, since it would repose in itself as things
do. Perception is thus thought about perceiving. Its incarnation furnishes no positive characteristic which has to be accounted for, and its
thisness (ecceity) is simply its own ignorance of itself. Analytical reﬂection becomes a purely regressive doctrine, according to which every
perception is a muddled form of intellection, and every setting of
bounds a negation. It thus does away with all problems except one: that
of its own beginning. The ﬁnitude of a perception which gives me, as
Spinoza expressed it, ‘consequences without premises’, the inherence
of consciousness in a point of view, these things amount to my ignorance of myself, to my negative power of not reﬂecting. But how is this
ignorance possible? we want to ask. To reply that it never is, would be
to abolish me as an inquiring philosopher. No philosophy can aﬀord to
be ignorant of the problem of ﬁnitude under pain of failing to understand itself as philosophy; no analysis of perception can aﬀord not to
conceive perception as a totally original phenomenon under pain of
misconceiving itself as analysis, and the inﬁnite thought discovered as
immanent in perception would not be the culminating point of consciousness, but on the contrary a form of unconsciousness. The
impetus of reﬂection would overshoot its goal: it would transport us
from a ﬁxed and determinate world to a consciousness without a rift in
it, whereas the perceived object is infused with secret life, and perception as a unity disintegrates and reforms ceaselessly. We shall have only
an abstract essence of consciousness as long as we refrain from following the actual movement by which it resumes its own operations at
every instant, focusing and concentrating them on an identiﬁable
object, gradually passing from ‘seeing’ to ‘knowing’ and achieving the
unity of its own life. We shall not reach this constitutive dimension if
we replace the plenary unity of consciousness by a completely transparent subject, and the ‘hidden art’ which calls up meaning from ‘the
depths of nature’, by some eternal thought. The intellectualist process
of self-discovery does not penetrate as far as this living nucleus of
perception because it is looking for the conditions which make it
possible or without which it would not exist, instead of uncovering the
operation which brings it into reality, or whereby it is constituted. In

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

actual perception taken at its origin, before any word is uttered, the
sign oﬀered to sense and the signiﬁcation are not even theoretically
separable. An object is an organism of colours, smells, sounds and
tactile appearances which symbolize, modify and accord with each
other according to the laws of a real logic which it is the task of science
to make explicit, and which it is far from having analysed completely.
Intellectualism is unequal to dealing with this perceptual life, either
falling short of it overshooting it; it calls up as limiting cases the manifold qualities which are merely the outer casing of the object, and from
there it passes on to a consciousness of the object which claims to hold
within itself the law or secret of that object, and which for this reason
deprives the development of the experience of its contingency and the
object of its distinctive perceptual style. This move from thesis to
antithesis, this ﬂying from one extreme to the other which is the
regular procedure of intellectualism leaves the starting-point of analysis
unaﬀected. We started oﬀ from a world in itself which acted upon our
eyes so as to cause us to see it, and we now have consciousness of or
thought about the world, but the nature of this world remains
unchanged: it is still deﬁned by the absolute mutual exteriority of its
parts, and is merely duplicated throughout its extent by a thought
which sustains it. We pass from absolute objectivity to absolute subjectivity, but this second idea is not better than the ﬁrst and is upheld only
against it, which means by it. The aﬃnity between intellectualism and
empiricism is thus much less obvious and much more deeply rooted
than is commonly thought. It arises not only from the anthropological
deﬁnition of sensation used equally by both, but from the fact that both
persist in the natural or dogmatic attitude, and the survival of sensation
in intellectualism is merely a sign of this dogmatism. Intellectualism
accepts as completely valid the idea of truth and the idea of being in
which the formative work of consciousness culminates and is
embodied, and its alleged reﬂection consists in positing as powers of
the subject all that is required to arrive at these ideas. The natural
attitude, by throwing me into the world of things, gives me the assurance of apprehending a ‘real’ beyond appearance, the ‘true’ beyond
illusion. The value of these notions is not questioned by intellectualism: it is merely a matter of conferring upon a universal creative
force the power of recognizing this same absolute truth that realism

45

46

phenomenology of perception

ingenuously places in a given creation. Intellectualism no doubt normally sets itself up as a doctrine of science and not of perception,
purporting to base its analysis on the test of mathematical truth and not
on the naïve acceptance of the self-evidence of the world: habemus ideam
veram. But in reality I would not know that I possess a true idea if my
memory did not enable me to relate what is now evident with what
was evident a moment ago, and, through the medium of words, correlate my evidence with that of others, so that Spinozist self-evidence
presupposes that of memory and perception. If, on the other hand, we
insist on basing our constitution of the past and of other people on our
power of recognizing the intrinsic truth of the idea, we do away with
the problem of others and that of the world, but then only because we
persist in the natural attitude which takes them for granted, and
because we put into action the force of naïve certainty. For never, as
Descartes and Pascal realized, can I at one stroke coincide with the pure
thought which constitutes even a simple idea. My clear and distinct
thought always uses thoughts already formulated by myself or others,
and relies on my memory, that is, on the nature of my mind, or else on the
memory of the community of thinkers, that is, upon the objective mind.
To take for granted that we have a true idea is to believe in uncritical
perception. Empiricism retained an absolute belief in the world as the
totality of spatio-temporal events, and treated consciousness as a province of this world. Analytical reﬂection, it is true, breaks with the world
in itself, since it constitutes it through the working of consciousness,
but this constituting consciousness, instead of being directly apprehended, is built up in such a way as to make possible the idea of an
absolute determinate being. It is the correlative of a universe, the subject possessing in absolutely completed form all the knowledge which
is adumbrated by our actual knowledge. What happens is that what
exists for us only in intention is presumed to be fully realized somewhere:
there is thought to be a system of absolutely true thoughts, capable of
co-ordinating all phenomena, a geometrized projection which clariﬁes
all perspectives, a pure object upon which all subjective views open.
Nothing less than this absolute object and this divine subject are
needed to ward oﬀ the threat of the malicious demon and to ensure
that we possess the true idea. Now there is indeed one human act
which at one stroke cuts through all possible doubts to stand in the full

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

light of truth: this act is perception, in the wide sense of knowledge of
existences. When I begin to perceive this table, I resolutely contract the
thickness of duration* which has elapsed while I have been looking at
it; I emerge from my individual life by apprehending the object as an
object for everybody. I therefore bring together in one operation concordant but discrete experiences which occupy several points of time
and several temporalities. We do not blame intellectualism for making
use of this decisive act which, within time, does the work of the
Spinozist eternity, this ‘original doxa’;32 what we do complain of, is
that it is here used tacitly. There is here a de facto power, as Descartes put
it, a quite irresistibly self-evident truth, which, by invoking an absolute
truth, brings together the separate phenomena of my present and my
past, of my duration* and that of others, which, however, must not be
severed from its perceptual origins and detached from its ‘facticity’.
Philosophy’s task is to reinstate it in the private ﬁeld of experience
from which it arises and elucidate its origin. If, however, this de facto
power is used without being explicitly posited, we become incapable
of seeing past the rending of separate experiences the phenomenon of
perception, and the world born in perception; we dissolve the perceived world into a universe which is nothing but this very world cut oﬀ
from its constitutive origins, and made manifest because they are
forgotten.
Thus intellectualism leaves consciousness on a footing of familiarity
with absolute being, while the idea of a world in itself persists as a
horizon or as the clue to analytical reﬂection. Doubt has certainly interrupted the explicit assertions concerning the world, but leaves
untouched its insidious presence, even though it be sublimated into
the ideal realm of absolute truth. Reﬂection, then, furnishes an essence
of consciousness, which is accepted dogmatically, and no one wonders
what an essence is, or whether the essence of thought adequately
covers the fact of thought. It loses the character of observation and
henceforth there can be no question of describing phenomena: the
perceptual appearance of illusions is challenged as the illusion of illusions; now only what is can be seen, the view itself and experience

being no longer distinct from conception. Hence a philosophy with
two guises, and observable in any doctrine of the understanding: a leap
is undertaken from a naturalistic view, which expresses our de facto
condition, to a transcendental sphere in which all bondage is theoretically removed, and we never have to wonder how the same subject
comes to be a part of the world and at the same time its principle
because the thing constituted exists only for the constituting agent. In
fact, the image of a constituted world where, with my body, I should
be only one object among others, and the idea of an absolute constituting consciousness are only apparently antithetical; they are a dual
expression of a universe perfectly explicit in itself. Authentic reﬂection,
instead of turning from one to the other as both true, in the manner of
a philosophy of the understanding, rejects them as both false.
It is true that we are perhaps once more distorting intellectualism.
When we say that analytical reﬂection anticipates all possible knowledge over and above what we at present know, that it includes reﬂection in its results and abolishes the phenomenon of ﬁnitude, perhaps
we are caricaturing intellectualism, and oﬀering in its name a worldcentred reﬂection, a truth as seen by the prisoner in the cave who
prefers the shadows to which he is accustomed and who does not
understand that they owe their existence to the light. Perhaps we have
not yet understood the real function of judgement in perception. The
analysis of the piece of wax means, one may say, not that there is a
reason hidden behind nature, but that reason is rooted in nature; the
‘inspection of the mind’ would then be, not the concept gravitating
towards nature, but nature rising to the concept. Perception would be a
judgement, which, however, is unaware of the reasons underlying its
own formation,33 which amounts to saying that the perceived object
presents itself as a totality and a unity before we have apprehended the
intelligible law governing it, and that the wax is not originally a pliable
and alterable bit of extension. When he says that natural judgement has
not ‘time to weigh and consider any reasons’, Descartes lets us know
that by the word ‘judgement’ he is thinking of the constitution of a
33

‘. . . I noticed that the judgements which I was accustomed to make about these
objects were formed within me before I had time to weigh and consider any reasons
which might have forced me to make them.’ 6th Meditation, AT, IX, p. 60.

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

meaning for the thing perceived which is not prior to the perception
itself and which seems to emanate from it.34 The vital knowledge or
‘natural inclination’ which shows us the union of body and soul, once
the light of nature has taught us to distinguish them, is a thing which it
seems contradictory to guarantee by divine truthfulness; for this is after
all nothing but the intrinsic clarity of the idea, and can in any case
validate only self-evident thoughts. But perhaps Descartes’ philosophy
consists in embracing this contradiction.35 When Descartes says that
the understanding knows itself incapable of knowing the union of soul
and body and leaves this knowledge for life to achieve,36 this means
that the act of understanding presents itself as reﬂection on an
unreﬂective experience which it does not absorb either in fact or in
theory. When I discover the intelligible structure of the piece of wax, I
do not identify myself with some absolute thought in relation to which
the wax is a mere result, I do not constitute it, I re-constitute it.
‘Natural judgment’ is nothing but the phenomenon of passivity. It will
always be the task of perception to know perception. Reﬂection never
lifts itself out of any situation, nor does the analysis of perception do
away with the fact of perception, the thisness of the percept or the
inherence of perceptual consciousness in some temporality and some
locality. Reﬂection is not absolutely transparent for itself, it is always
given to itself in an experience, in the Kantian sense of the word, it always
springs up without itself knowing whence it springs and oﬀers itself to
me as a gift of nature. But if the description of the unreﬂective experience remains valid after reﬂection and the Sixth Meditation after the Second,
conversely this unreﬂective experience is known to us only through
reﬂection and cannot be posited outside itself as an unknowable
ﬁnal stage. Between the self which analyses perception and the self
which perceives, there is always a distance. But in the concrete act of

reﬂection, I abolish this distance, I prove by that very token that I am
capable of knowing what I was perceiving, I control in practice the discontinuity of the two selves, and it would seem that, in the last resort,
the signiﬁcance of the cogito lies not in revealing a universal constituting
force or in reducing perception to intellection, but in establishing the
fact of reﬂection which both pierces and sustains the opacity of perception. It would be quite consistent with the Cartesian intention to have
thus identiﬁed reason and the human condition, and it might be held
that the ultimate signiﬁcance of Cartesianism is to be found here. The
‘natural judgement’ of intellectualism in this case anticipates the
Kantian judgement which sees the birth of the individual object’s
meaning in the object itself, and does not see it as imposed readymade.37 Cartesianism, like Kantianism, would seem to have seen quite
clearly that the problem of perception resides in its being an originating
knowledge. There is an empirical or second-order perception, the
one which we exercise at every moment, and which conceals from
us the former basic phenomenon, because it is loaded with earlier
acquisitions and plays, so to speak, on the surface of being.
When I glance rapidly about at the objects surrounding me in order
to ﬁnd my bearings and locate myself among them, I scarcely can be
said to grasp the world in some instantaneous aspect. I identify here the
door, there the window, over there my table, all of which are the props
and guides of a practical intention directed elsewhere, and which are
therefore given to me simply as meanings. But when I contemplate an
object with the sole intention of watching it exist and unfold its riches
before my eyes, then it ceases to be an allusion to a general type, and I
become aware that each perception, and not merely that of sights
which I am discovering for the ﬁrst, time, reenacts on its own account
the birth of intelligence and has some element of creative genius about
it: in order that I may recognize the tree as a tree, it is necessary that,
beneath this familiar meaning, the momentary arrangement of the

The faculty of judging ‘must, then, itself provide a concept, which in reality does not
bring knowledge of any thing, and which serves as a rule only for itself, not an objective
rule to which its judgement is to be adapted; for then would be needed another faculty of
judging in order to be able to discern whether this is or is not a case to which the rule
applies.’ (Critique of Judgement, Preface.)

visible scene should begin all over again, as on the very ﬁrst day of the
vegetable kingdom, to outline the individual idea of this tree. Such
would be natural judgement, which cannot yet know its reasons since
it is in process of creating them. But even if we grant that existence,
individuality, ‘facticity’ are on the horizon of Cartesian thought, there
remains the question whether it has posited them. Now we must recognize that it could have done so only by transforming itself radically.
To make perception into an original knowledge, we should have had to
endow ﬁnitude with a positive signiﬁcance and take seriously the
strange phrase in the 4th Meditation which makes me ‘a middle term
between God and nothingness’. But if nothingness is without properties, as the 5th Meditation leads one to understand, and as Malebranche
asserts, if it is nothing, this deﬁnition of the human subject is merely a
manner of speaking and the ﬁnite has nothing positive about it. In
order to see in reﬂection a creative deed, a reconstituting of past
thought not preﬁgured in that past thought, yet specifying it perfectly
validly—because only thus have we any idea of it, because the past in
itself is for us as if it had never been—it would have been necessary to
develop an intuition of time to which the Meditations contain only a brief
allusion. ‘Let who will deceive me, the fact remains that he cannot
cause me to be nothing when I think I am something; or cause it to be true
one day that I have never existed, since it is true that I now exist.’38 The experience
of the present is that of a being assured of his existence once and for all,
whom nothing could ever prevent from having been. In the certitude
of the present, there is an intention which outruns the presentness of
the present, which posits it in advance as an indubitable ‘former present’ in the series of recollections, and perception as knowledge of the
present is the central phenomenon which makes possible the unity of
the ego and with it the ideas of objectivity and truth. But in the text it is
given merely as one of those self-evidences which are irresistible only de
facto, and which remain in doubt.39 The Cartesian solution is therefore
not to accept as a guarantee of itself human thought in its factual
reality, but to base it on a thought which possesses itself absolutely.
The connection between essence and existence is not found in

experience, but in the idea of the inﬁnite. It is, then, true in the
last resort that analytical reﬂection entirely rests on a dogmatic idea
of being, and that in this sense it does not amount to an act of selfdiscovery.40
40

Following its own line, analytical reﬂection does not bring us back to authentic subjectivity; it conceals from us the vital node of perceptual consciousness because it looks
for the conditions in which absolutely determinate being is possible, and is dazzled by
the theological view, falsely regarded as self-evident, that nothingness is nothing. The
philosophers who practised this method, however, have always felt that it was necessary
to search beneath absolute consciousness. We have just seen that this is so in the case of
Descartes. One could show it equally with Lagneau and Alain.
Analytical reﬂection carried to its limit should leave on the subject’s side only a
universal naturans for which the system of experience exists, including my body and my
empirical self, linked to the world by the laws of physics and psycho-physiology. The
sensation which we construct as the ‘psychic’ extension of the sensory stimuli obviously
does not belong to the universal naturans and all idea of a genesis of mind is a hybrid idea,
because it puts back into time the mind for which time exists, and confuses the two
selves. Nevertheless, if we are this absolute mind, without a history, and if nothing stands
between us and the true world, if the empirical self is constituted by the transcendental
ego and set out before it, we ought to pierce its opacity, and it is not possible to see how
error is possible, still less illusion—the ‘abnormal perception’ which no knowledge can
conjure away. (Langeau, Célèbres Leçons, pp. 161–2.). It can be said (ibid.) that illusion and
perception in its entirety are on this side of both truth and error. This does not help us to
solve the problem, since it then becomes one of knowing how a mind can be ‘on this
side of’ truth and error. When we feel (sentir), we do not perceive our sensation as object
in a network of psycho-physiological relationships. We do not possess the truth of
sensation. We are not confronted by the true world. ‘It amounts to the same thing to say
either that we are individuals or to say that in these individuals there is a sentinent nature
in which something happens which is not a result of the action of the environment. If
everything in our sentinent nature were subject to necessity, if there were for us a
manner of feeling which was the true one, if at every moment our manner of feeling
were produced by the external world, we should not feel at all.’ (Célèbres Leçons, p. 164.)
Thus feeling does not belong to the order of the constituted, nor does the ego ﬁnd this
order set out before it, escapes from its gaze, it is as it were piled up behind it and
produces a kind of thickness or opacity which makes error possible, it marks out an area
of subjectivity or solitude, it represents for us what is ‘anterior to’ the mind, evokes the
latter’s birth and calls for a more searching analysis capable of elucidating ‘the genealogy
of logic’. The mind is conscious of itself as ‘based’ on this nature. There is therefore a
dialectic of the naturata and of the naturans, of perception and judgement, in the course of
which their relationship is reversed.
The same tendency is to be found in Alain in the analysis of perception. One realizes
that a tree always looks bigger than a man, even if it is at a distance and the man near. I am

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

When intellectualism took over the naturalistic notion of sensation,
a whole philosophy was implied in the step. Conversely, now that
psychology ﬁnally discards this notion, we can look forward, in consequence, to the beginning of a new type of reﬂection. On the psychological level, the criticism of the ‘constancy hypothesis’ means merely
that the judgement is abandoned as an explanatory factor in the theory
of perception. How can we pretend that the perception of distance is a
conclusion reached from the apparent size of objects, from the disparity between retinal images, from the adjustment of the crystalline lens,
from the varying convergence of the eyes; or that the perception of
relief is a conclusion drawn from the diﬀerence between the images
furnished respectively by the left and right eyes, since, if we stick to
tempted to say that ‘Here again a judgement enlarges the object. But let us look more
closely. The object is unchanged because an object in itself has no size; size is always
relative, and so the size of these objects and of all objects forms an indivisible whole and
one truly without parts. Sizes must be judged together. From which it is seen that one
must not confuse material things, always separate and made up of mutually external
parts, and the thought of these things, in which no division can be admitted. However
obscure this distinction may be now, and however diﬃcult it must always remain to
conceive it, let us keep it in mind. In a sense, considered materially, things are divided
into parts of which one is not another; but in another sense, considered as thoughts,
perceptions of things are indivisible and without parts.’ (Quatre-vingt-un chapitres sur l’Esprit et
les Passions, p. 18.) But then an inspection of the mind which surveyed them and established one in virtue of the other would not be true subjectivity and would borrow too
much from things considered as in themselves. Perception does not draw conclusions
about the size of the tree from that of the man, or about the man’s size from the tree’s,
nor either from the meaning of the two objects; it does all these things at once: the size of
the tree, that of the man, and their signiﬁcance as tree and man, with the result that each
element agrees with all the others and composes with them a landscape in which all coexist. Thus do we broach the analysis of what makes size possible, and more generally the
relations or properties of the predicative order, and we broach that subjectivity ‘prior to
all geometry’ which Alain nevertheless declared unknowable. (Ibid., p. 29.) Analytical
reﬂection becomes more strictly conscious of itself as analysis. It becomes aware that it
had left behind its object, perception. It recognizes behind the judgement which it had
brought into evidence, a deeper function than judgement which makes judgement possible; it rediscovers, before arriving at things, phenomena. This is the function envisaged
by psychologists when they talk about a Gestaltung of the landscape. It is to the description
of phenomena that they redirect the philosopher, by separating them rigidly from the
constituted objective world, and they do it in terms which are almost identical with
Alain’s.

pehnomena, none of these ‘signs’ is clearly given to consciousness, and
since there could be no reasoning where the premises are lacking? But
this criticism of intellectualism only aﬀects its popularization by psychologists. And, like intellectualism itself, it has to be transferred to the
level of reﬂection, where the philosopher is no longer trying to explain
perception, but to coincide with and understand the perceptual process. Here the criticism of the constancy hypothesis reveals that perception is not an act of understanding. I have only to look at a landscape
upside down to recognize nothing in it. Now ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ have
only a relative meaning for the understanding, which can hardly regard
the orientation of the landscape as an absolute obstacle. For the understanding a square is always a square, whether it stands on a side or an
angle. For perception it is in the second case hardly recognizable. The
Paradox of symmetrical objects contrasted the originality of perceptual
experience with logicism. This idea has to be taken up and generalized:
there is a signiﬁcance of the percept which has no equivalent in the
universe of the understanding, a perceptual domain which is not yet
the objective world, a perceptual being which is not yet determinate
being. However, the psychologists who practise the description of phenomena are not normally aware of the philosophical implications of
their method. They do not see that the return to perceptual experience,
in so far as it is a consequential and radical reform, puts out of court all
forms of realism, that is to say, all philosophies which leave consciousness and take as given one of its results—that the real sin of intellectualism lies precisely in having taken as given the determinate universe of
science, that this reproach applies a fortiori to psychological thinking,
since it places perceptual consciousness in the midst of a ready-made
world, and that the attack on the constancy hypothesis carried to its
logical conclusion assumes the value of a genuine ‘phenomenological
reduction’.41 Gestalt theory has clearly shown that the alleged signs of
distance—the apparent size of the object, the number of objects interposed between it and us, the disparity of retinal images, the degree of
adjustment and convergence—are expressly known only in an analytic
or reﬂective perception which turns away from the object to its mode
of presentation, and that we do not go through these stages in knowing

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

distances. Nevertheless, it goes on to conclude that, not being signs or
reasons in our perception of distance, bodily impressions or the interposed objects in the ﬁeld can only be causes of this perception.42 So we
are back in an explanatory psychology, the ideal of which has never
been abandoned by Gestalt psychology,43 because, as psychology, it
has never broken with naturalism. But by this very fact it betrays its
own descriptions. A subject whose oculo-motor muscles are paralysed
sees objects moving to his left whenever he believes that he is turning
his eyes towards the left. This, classical psychology maintains, is
because perception reasons: the eye is supposed to swing to the left,
and since nevertheless the retinal images have not moved, the view
must have slipped leftwards to have kept them in place in the eye.
Gestalt theory informs us that the perception of the position of objects
does not pass through the detour of an express body-consciousness: at
no moment do I know that the images remain stationary on the retina;
I see directly the landscape move to the left. But consciousness is not
conﬁned to receiving ready-made an illusory phenomenon produced
outside itself by physiological causes. For the illusion to be produced,
the subject must have intended to look to the left and must have
thought he moved his eye. The illusion regarding the subjects’ body
entails the appearance of movement in the object. The movements of
his body are naturally invested with a certain perceptual signiﬁcance,
and form, with the external phenomena, such a well articulated system
that external perception ‘takes account’ of the movement of the organs
of perception, ﬁnding in them if not the express explanation, at least the
motive for the changes brought about in the spectacle, and can thus
understand them instantly. When I intend to look left, this movement
of the eye carries within it as its natural translation an oscillation of the
visual ﬁeld: the objects remain in place, but after a moment’s ﬂuctuation. This consequence is not learnt but is one of the natural formations of the psychosomatic subject. It is, as we shall see, an annex of our
‘bodily schema’, the immanent meaning of a shift of ‘gaze’. When it
stops short of such a change, when we are conscious of moving our
eyes without the view’s being aﬀected, the phenomenon is translated,

without any express deduction, by an apparent shift of the object leftwards. The gaze and the landscape remain as it were glued together, no
quiver dissociates them, and the gaze, in its illusory movement, carries
with it the landscape, and the latter’s sideslip is fundamentally nothing
but its ﬁxity in a gaze which we think is moving. Thus the immobility
of images on the retina and the paralysis of the oculo-motor muscles
are not objective causes which produce the illusion and carry it readymade into consciousness. Nor are the intention to move the eye and the
landscape’s passivity in relation to this impulse premises or reasons for
the illusion. But they are the motives (motifs). In the same way, the objects
interposed between me and the thing upon which I ﬁx my eyes are not
perceived for themselves; they are nevertheless perceived, and we have
no reason for refusing to recognize that this marginal perception plays
a part in seeing distance, since, when the intervening objects are hidden by a screen, the distance appears to shrink. The objects ﬁlling up
the ﬁeld do not act on the apparent distance in the relation of cause to
eﬀect. When the screen is removed, we see remoteness born of the
intervening objects. This is the silent language whereby perception
communicates with us: interposed objects, in the natural context,
‘mean’ a greater distance. It is not, however, a question of a connection
recognized by objective logic, the logic of constituted truth: for there is
no reason why a steeple should appear to me to be smaller and farther
away when I am better able to see in detail the slopes and ﬁelds
between me and it. There is no reason, but there is a motive. It is
precisely Gestalt psychology which has brought home to us the tensions which run like lines of force across the visual ﬁeld and the system: own body-world, and which breathe into it a secret and magic life
by exerting here and there forces of distortion, contraction and expansion. The disparity between retinal images, and the number of intermediate objects do not act either as mere objective causes producing
from outside my perception of distance, or as demonstrative reasons
for it. They are tacitly known to perception in an obscure form, and
they validate it by a wordless logic. But what Gestalt psychology lacks
for the adequate expression of these perceptual relationships is a set of
new categories: it has admitted the principle, and applied it to a few
individual cases, but without realizing that a complete reform of
understanding is called for if we are to translate phenomena accurately;

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’

and that to this end the objective thinking of classical logic and philosophy will have to be questioned, the categories of the world laid
aside, the alleged self-evidence of realism placed in doubt, in the
Cartesian sense, and a true ‘phenomenological reduction’ undertaken.
Objective thought, as applied to the universe and not to phenomena,
knows only alternative notions; starting from actual experience, it
deﬁnes pure concepts which are mutually exclusive: the notion of
extension, which is that of an absolute externality of one part to another,
and the notion of thought which is that of a being wrapped up in
himself; the notion of the vocal sign as a physical phenomenon arbitrarily linked to certain thoughts, and that of meaning as a thought entirely
clear to itself; the notion of cause as a determining factor external to its
eﬀect, and that of reason as a law of intrinsic constitution of the phenomenon. Now, as we have seen, the perception of our own body and
the perception of external things provide an example of non-positing
consciousness, that is, of consciousness not in possession of fully
determinate objects, that of a logic lived through which cannot account for
itself, and that of an immanent meaning which is not clear to itself and
becomes fully aware of itself only through experiencing certain natural
signs. These phenomena cannot be assimilated by objective thought,
and that is why Gestalt psychology which, like all psychology, is
imprisoned within the ‘self-evident truths’ of science and of the world,
can choose only between reason and cause, and that is why any criticism of intellectualism which it undertakes ends with the rehabilitation
of realism and causal thinking. On the other hand, the phenomenological notion of motivation is one of those ‘ﬂuid’44 concepts which have
to be formed if we want to get back to phenomena. One phenomenon
releases another, not by means of some objective eﬃcient cause, like
those which link together natural events, but by the meaning which it
holds out—there is a raison d’être for a thing which guides the ﬂow of
phenomena without being explicitly laid down in any one of them, a
sort of operative reason. Thus the intention to look to the left and the
44

‘ﬂieszende’, Husserl, Erfahrung und Urteil, p. 428. It was not until his last period that
Husserl himself became fully aware of what the return to phenomena meant, and tacitly
broke with the philosophy of essences. He was in this way merely explicitly laying down
analytic procedures which he had long been applying, as is precisely shown by the
notion of motivation to be found already in the Ideen.

57

58

phenomenology of perception

fact that the landscape remains stubbornly ﬁxed in one’s gaze bring
about the illusion of movement in the object. To the degree that the
motivated phenomenon comes into being, an internal relation to the
motivating phenomenon appears; hence, instead of the one merely
succeeding the other, the motivated phenomenon makes the motivating phenomenon explicit and comprehensible, and thus seems to have
preexisted its own motive. Thus the object at a distance and its physical
projection on the retinas explain the disparity of images, and, through
a retrospective illusion, we speak with Malebranche about a natural
geometry of perception. We place beforehand within perception a science constructed upon it, and we lose sight of the original relationship
of motivation, in which distance springs into existence ahead of any
science, not from a judgement of ‘the two images’, for these are not
numerically distinct, but from the phenomenon of the ‘shift’, from the
forces which reside in this rough outline, which are trying to come to
rest and which lead it to the most determinate form possible. To a
Cartesian doctrine, these descriptions will never have any philosophic
importance: they will be treated as allusions to unreﬂective states of
mind, which, by their nature, can never become articulate and which,
like any form of psychology, are without truth in the eyes of the
understanding. In order to admit them completely, it would be necessary to show that in no case can consciousness entirely cease to be what
it is in perception, that is, a fact, and that it cannot take full possession
of its operations. The recognition of phenomena, then, implies a
theory of reﬂection and a new cogito.45
45

See below, Part III. Gestalt psychology has adopted a kind of reﬂection the theory of
which is furnished by Husserl’s phenomenology. Are we wrong to discern a whole
philosophy implicit in the criticism of the ‘constancy hypothesis’? Although we are not
here concerned with history, it may be pointed out that the aﬃnity of Gestalt psychology
and phenomenology is equally attested by external similarities. It is no chance occurrence that Köhler should propose, as the task of psychology, ‘phenomenological description’ (Über unbemerkte Empﬁndungen und Urteilstäuschungen, p. 70). Or that Koﬀka, a former
disciple of Husserl, should trace the leading ideas of his psychology back to this inﬂuence, and try to show that the attack on psychologism leaves Gestalt psychology
untouched (Principles of Gestalt Psychology, pp. 614–83), the Gestalt being, not a mental event
of the type of an impression, but a whole which develops a law of internal coherence. Or
that ﬁnally Husserl, in his last period, still further away from logicism, which he had
moreover attacked along with psychologism, should have taken up the notion of

‘attention’ and ‘judgement’
‘conﬁguration’ and even of Gestalt (cf. Die Krisis der europäischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale Phanomenologie, I, pp. 106, 109). What is true is that the reaction against naturalism
and against causal thinking is, in Gestalt psychology, neither consequential, nor radical,
as can be seen from the naïve realism of its theory of knowledge (cf. La Structure du
Comportement, p. 180). Gestalt psychology cannot see that psychological atomism is only
one particular case of a more general prejudice; the prejudice of determinate being or of
the world, and that is why it forgets its most valid descriptions when it tries to provide
itself with a theoretical framework. It is unexceptionable only in the middle regions of
reﬂection. When it tries to reﬂect on its own analysis, it treats consciousness, despite its
principles, as a collection of ‘forms’. This is enough to Justify Husserl’s criticisms
expressly directed against Gestalt psychology, but applicable to all psychology (Nachwort
zu meiner Ideen, pp. 564 and ﬀ.) at a time when he was still distinguishing fact and essence,
when he had not yet arrived at the idea of historical constitution, and when, consequently, he was stressing the break, rather than the parallelism, between psychology
and phenomenology. We have quoted elsewhere (La Structure du Comportement, p. 280) a text
of E. Fink restoring the balance. As for the fundamental question, which is that of the
transcendental attitude in relation to the natural attitude, it will not be possible to settle it
until we reach the last part of this work, where we shall examine the transcendental
meaning of time.

4
THE PHENOMENAL FIELD
It will now be seen in what direction the following chapters will carry
their inquiry. ‘Sense experience’* has become once more a question
for us. Empiricism had emptied it of all mystery by bringing it down to
the possession of a quality. This had been possible only at the price of
moving far from the ordinary acceptation of the word. Between sense
experience and knowing, common experience establishes a diﬀerence
which is not that between the quality and the concept. This rich notion
of sense experience is still to be found in Romantic usage, for example
in Herder. It points to an experience in which we are given not ‘dead’
qualities, but active ones. A wooden wheel placed on the ground is not,
for sight, the same thing as a wheel bearing a load. A body at rest because
no force is being exerted upon it is again for sight not the same thing as
a body in which opposing forces are in equilibrium.1 The light of a
candle changes its appearance for a child when, after a burn, it stops
attracting the child’s hand and becomes literally repulsive.2 Vision is
already inhabited by a meaning (sens) which gives it a function in the
spectacle of the world and in our existence. The pure quale would be

the phenomenal field

given to us only if the world were a spectacle and one’s own body a
mechanism with which some impartial mind made itself acquainted.3
Sense experience, on the other hand, invests the quality with vital
value, grasping it ﬁrst in its meaning for us, for that heavy mass which
is our body, whence it comes about that it always involves a reference
to the body. The problem is to understand these strange relationships
which are woven between the parts of the landscape, or between it and
me as incarnate subject, and through which an object perceived can
concentrate in itself a whole scene or become the imago of a whole
segment of life. Sense experience is that vital communication with the
world which makes it present as a familiar setting of our life. It is to it
that the perceived object and the perceiving subject owe their thickness. It is the intentional tissue which the eﬀort to know will try to take
apart. With the problem of sense experience, we rediscover that of
association and passivity. They have ceased to be problematical because
the classical philosophies put themselves either below or above them,
giving them everything or nothing: sometimes association was understood as a mere de facto co-existence, sometimes derived from an intellectual construction; sometimes passivity was imported from things
into the mind, and sometimes analytical reﬂection would ﬁnd in it an
activity of understanding. Whereas these notions take on their full
meaning if sense experience is distinguished from quality: then association, or rather ‘aﬃnity’, in the Kantian sense, is the central phenomenon of perceptual life, since it is the constitution, without any ideal
model, of a signiﬁcant grouping. The distinction between the perceptual life and the concept, between passivity and spontaneity is no
longer abolished by analytical reﬂection, since we are no longer forced
by the atomism of sensation to look to some connecting activity for
our principle of all co-ordination. Finally, after sense experience,
understanding also needs to be redeﬁned, since the general connective
function ultimately attributed to it by Kantianism is now spread over
the whole intentional life and no longer suﬃces to distinguish it. We
shall try to bring out in relation to perception, both the instinctive
substructure and the superstructures erected upon it by the exercise of
intelligence. As Cassirer puts it, by mutilating perception from above,
3

Scheler, Die Wissenformen und die Gesellschaft, p. 408.

61

62

phenomenology of perception

empiricism mutilated it from below too:4 the impression is as devoid
of instinctive and aﬀective meaning as of ideal signiﬁcance. One might
add that mutilating perception from below, treating it immediately as
knowledge and forgetting its existential content, amounts to mutilating
it from above, since it involves taking for granted and passing over in
silence the decisive moment in perception: the upsurge of a true and
exact world. Reﬂection will be sure of having precisely located the
centre of the phenomenon if it is equally capable of bringing to light its
vital inherence and its rational intention.
So, ‘sensation’ and ‘judgement’ have together lost their apparent
clearness: we have observed that they were clear only as long as the
prejudice in favour of the world was maintained. As soon as one tried
by means of them, to picture consciousness in the process of perceiving, to revive the forgotten perceptual experience, and to relate them to
it, they were found to be inconceivable. By dint of making these diﬀiculties more explicit, we were drawn implicitly into a new kind of
analysis, into a new dimension in which they were destined to disappear. The criticism of the constancy hypothesis and more generally the
reduction of the idea of ‘the world’ opened up a phenomenal ﬁeld which
now has to be more accurately circumscribed, and suggested the
rediscovery of a direct experience which must be, at least provisionally,
assigned its place in relation to scientiﬁc knowledge, and to
psychological and philosophical reﬂection.
Science and philosophy have for centuries been sustained by
unquestioning faith in perception. Perception opens a window on to
things. This means that it is directed, quasi-teleologically, towards a
truth in itself in which the reason underlying all appearances is to be
found. The tacit thesis of perception is that at every instant experience
can be co-ordinated with that of the previous instant and that of the
following, and my perspective with that of other consciousnesses—
that all contradictions can be removed, that monadic and intersubjective experience is one unbroken text—that what is now indeterminate
for me could become determinate for a more complete knowledge,
which is as it were realized in advance in the thing, or rather which is
the thing itself. Science has ﬁrst been merely the sequel or ampliﬁcation
4

Cassirer, Philosophie der symbolischen Formen, T. III, Phänomenologie der Erkenntnis, pp. 77–8.

the phenomenal field

of the process which constitutes perceived things. Just as the thing is
the invariant of all sensory ﬁelds and of all individual perceptual ﬁelds,
so the scientiﬁc concept is the means of ﬁxing and objectifying phenomena. Science deﬁned a theoretical state of bodies not subject to the
action of any force, and ipso facto deﬁned force, reconstituting with the
aid of these ideal components the processes actually observed. It established statistically the chemical properties of pure bodies, deducing
from these those of empirical bodies, and seeming thus to hold the
plan of creation or in any case to have found a reason immanent in the
world. The notion of geometrical space, indiﬀerent to its contents, that
of pure movement which does not by itself aﬀect the properties of the
object, provided phenomena with a setting of inert existence in which
each event could be related to physical conditions responsible for the
changes occurring, and therefore contributed to this freezing of being
which appeared to be the task of physics. In thus developing the
concept of the thing, scientiﬁc knowledge was not aware that it was
working on a presupposition. Precisely because perception, in its vital
implications and prior to any theoretical thought, is presented as perception of a being, it was not considered necessary for reﬂection to
undertake a genealogy of being, and it was therefore conﬁned to seeking the conditions which make being possible. Even if one took
account of the transformations of determinant consciousness,5 even if
it were conceded that the constitution of the object is never completed,
there was nothing to add to what science said of it; the natural object
remained an ideal unity for us and, in the famous words of Lachelier, a
network of general properties. It was no use denying any ontological
value to the principles of science and leaving them with only a methodical value,6 for this reservation made no essential change as far as
philosophy was concerned, since the sole conceivable being remained
deﬁned by scientiﬁc method. The living body, under these circumstances, could not escape the determinations which alone made the
object into an object and without which it would have had no place in
the system of experience. The value predicates which the reﬂecting
judgement confers upon it had to be sustained, in being, by a

63

phenomenology of perception

foundation of physico-chemical properties. In ordinary experience we
ﬁnd a ﬁttingness and a meaningful relationship between the gesture,
the smile and the tone of a speaker. But this reciprocal relationship of
expression which presents the human body as the outward manifestation of a certain manner of being-in-the-world, had, for mechanistic
physiology, to be resolved into a series of causal relations.
It was necessary to link to centripetal conditions the centrifugal
phenomenon of expression, reduce to third person processes that particular way of dealing with the world which we know as behaviour,
bring experience down to the level of physical nature and convert the
living body into an interiorless thing. The emotional and practical attitudes of the living subject in relation to the world were, then,
incorporated into a psycho-physiological mechanism. Every evaluation
had to be the outcome of a transfer whereby complex situations
became capable of awakening elementary impressions of pleasure and
pain, impressions bound up, in turn, with nervous processes. The
impelling intentions of the living creature were converted into objective movements: to the will only an instantaneous ﬁat was allowed, the
execution of the act being entirely given over to a nervous mechanism.
Sense experience, thus detached from the aﬀective and motor functions, became the mere reception of a quality, and physiologists
thought they could follow, from the point of reception to the nervous
centres, the projection of the external world in the living body. The
latter, thus transformed, ceased to be my body, the visible expression of
a concrete Ego, and became one object among all others. Conversely,
the body of another person could not appear to me as encasing another
Ego. It was merely a machine, and the perception of the other could not
really be of the other, since it resulted from an inference and therefore
placed behind the automaton no more than a consciousness in general,
a transcendent cause and not an inhabitant of his movements. So we no
longer had a grouping of factors constituting the self co-existing in a
world. The whole concrete content of ‘psychic states’ resulting, according to the laws of psychophysiology and psychology, from a universal
determinism, was integrated into the in-itself. There was no longer any
real for-itself other than the thought of the scientist which perceives the
system and which alone ceases to occupy any place in it. Thus, while
the living body became an exterior without interior, subjectivity

the phenomenal field

became an interior without exterior, an impartial spectator. The naturalism of science and the spiritualism of the universal constituting subject, to which reﬂection on science led, had this in common, that they
levelled out experience: in face of the constituting I, the empirical
selves are objects. The empirical Self is a hybrid notion, a mixture of
in-itself and for-itself, to which reﬂective philosophy could give no
status. In so far as it has a concrete content it is inserted in the system of
experience and is therefore not a subject; in so far as it is a subject, it is
empty and resolves itself into the transcendental subject. The ideality of
the object, the objectiﬁcation of the living body, the placing of spirit in
an axio-logical dimension having no common measure with nature,
such is the transparent philosophy arrived at by pushing further along
the route of knowledge opened up by perception. It could be held that
perception is an incipient science, science a methodical and complete
perception,7 since science was merely following uncritically the ideal
of knowledge set up by the perceived thing.
Now this philosophy is collapsing before our eyes. The natural
object was the ﬁrst to disappear and physics has itself recognized the
limits of its categories by demanding a recasting and blending of the
pure concepts which it had adopted. For its part the organism presents
physico-chemical analysis not with the practical diﬃculties of a complex object, but with the theoretical diﬃculty of a meaningful being.8
In more general terms the idea of a universe of thought or a universe of
values, in which all thinking lives come into contact and are reconciled,
is called into question. Nature is not in itself geometrical, and it appears
so only to a careful observer who contents himself with macrocosmic
data. Human society is not a community of reasonable minds, and only
in fortunate countries where a biological and economic balance has
locally and temporarily been struck has such a conception of it been
possible. The experience of chaos, both on the speculative and the
other level, prompts us to see rationalism in a historical perspective
which it set itself on principle to avoid, to seek a philosophy which
explains the upsurge of reason in a world not of its making and to

prepare the substructure of living experience without which reason
and liberty are emptied of their content and wither away. We shall no
longer hold that perception is incipient science, but conversely that
classical science is a form of perception which loses sight of its origins
and believes itself complete. The ﬁrst philosophical act would appear to
be to return to the world of actual experience which is prior to the
objective world, since it is in it that we shall be able to grasp the
theoretical basis no less than the limits of that objective world, restore
to things their concrete physiognomy, to organisms their individual
ways of dealing with the world, and to subjectivity its inherence in
history. Our task will be, moreover, to rediscover phenomena, the layer
of living experience through which other people and things are ﬁrst
given to us, the system ‘Self-others-things’ as it comes into being; to
reawaken perception and foil its trick of allowing us to forget it as a fact
and as perception in the interest of the object which it presents to us
and of the rational tradition to which it gives rise.
This phenomenal ﬁeld is not an ‘inner world’, the ‘phenomenon’ is
not a ‘state of consciousness’, or a ‘mental fact’, and the experience of
phenomena is not an act of introspection or an intuition in Bergson’s
sense. It has long been the practice to deﬁne the object of psychology
by saying that it was ‘without extension’ and ‘accessible to one person
only’, with the result that this peculiar object could be grasped only by
means of a special kind of act, ‘internal perception’ or introspection, in
which subject and object were mingled and knowledge achieved by an
act of coinciding. The return to the ‘immediate data of consciousness’
became therefore a hopeless enterprise since the philosophical scrutiny
was trying to be what it could not, in principle, see. The diﬃculty was
not only to destroy the prejudice of the exterior, as all philosophies
urge the beginner to do, or to describe the mind in a language made
for representing things. It was much more fundamental, since inferiority, deﬁned by the impression, by its nature evaded every attempt to
express it. It was not only the imparting of philosophical intuitions to
others which became diﬃcult—or rather reduced itself to a sort of
incantation designed to induce in them experiences comparable to the
philosopher’s—but the philosopher himself could not be clearly aware
of what he saw in the instant, since he would have had to think it, that is
ﬁx and distort it. The immediate was therefore a lonely, blind and mute

the phenomenal field

life. The return to the phenomenal presents none of these peculiarities.
The sensible conﬁguration of an object or a gesture, which the criticism of the constancy hypothesis brings before our eyes, is not grasped
in some inexpressible coincidence, it ‘is understood’ through a sort of
act of appropriation which we all experience when we say that we have
‘found’ the rabbit in the foliage of a puzzle, or that we have ‘caught’ a
slight gesture. Once the prejudice of sensation has been banished, a
face, a signature, a form of behaviour cease to be mere ‘visual data’
whose psychological meaning is to be sought in our inner experience,
and the mental life of others becomes an immediate object, a whole
charged with immanent meaning. More generally it is the very notion
of the immediate which is transformed: henceforth the immediate is
no longer the impression, the object which is one with the subject, but
the meaning, the structure, the spontaneous arrangement of parts. My
own ‘mental life’ is given to me in precisely the same way, since
the criticism of the constancy hypothesis teaches me to recognize the
articulation and melodic unity of my behaviour as original data of
inner experience, and since introspection, when brought down to its
positive content, consists equally in making the immanent meaning of
any behaviour explicit.9 Thus what we discover by going beyond the
prejudice of the objective world is not an occult inner world. Nor is
this world of living experience completely closed to naïve consciousness, as is Bergson’s inferiority. In criticizing the constancy hypothesis
and in laying bare phenomena, the psychologist, it is true, runs counter
to the natural direction of the process of knowing, which goes blindly
through the operations of perception straight on to their teleological
results. Nothing is more diﬃcult than to know precisely what we see.
‘There is in natural intuition a sort of “crypto-mechanism” which we
have to break in order to reach phenomenal being’10 or again a dialectic
whereby perception hides itself from itself. But although it is of the
essence of consciousness to forget its own phenomena thus enabling
‘things’ to be constituted, this forgetfulness is not mere absence, it is
the absence of something which consciousness could bring into its

presence: in other words consciousness can forget phenomena only
because it can recall them, it neglects them in favour of things only
because they are the cradle of things. For example they are never completely unknown to scientiﬁc consciousness, which borrows all its
models from the structures of living experience; it simply does not
‘thematize’ them, or make explicit the horizons of perceptual consciousness surrounding it to whose concrete relationships it tries to
give objective expression. Experience of phenomena is not, then, like
Bergsonian intuition, that of a reality of which we are ignorant and
leading to which there is no methodical bridge—it is the making
explicit or bringing to light of the prescientiﬁc life of consciousness
which alone endows scientiﬁc operations with meaning and to which
these latter always refer back. It is not an irrational conversion, but an
intentional analysis.
If, as we see, phenomenological psychology is distinguished in all its
characteristics from introspective psychology, it is because it is diﬀerent in basic principle. Introspective psychology detected, on the perimeter of the physical world, a zone of consciousness in which physical
concepts are no longer valid, but the psychologist still believed consciousness to be no more than a sector of being, and he decided to
explore this sector as the physicist explores his. He tried to describe the
givens of consciousness but without putting into question the absolute
existence of the world surrounding it. In company with the scientist
and common sense, he presupposed the objective world as the logical
framework of all his descriptions, and as the setting of his thought. He
was unaware that this presupposition dominated the meaning given to
the word ‘being’, forcing it to bring consciousness into existence
under the name of ‘psychic fact’, and thus diverting it from a true
grasp of consciousness or from truly immediate experience, and stultifying the many precautions taken to avoid distorting the ‘interior’. This
is what happened to empiricism when it replaced the physical world
by a world of inner events. It is again what happens to Bergson precisely when he contrasts ‘multiplicity of fusion’ and ‘multiplicity of
juxtaposition’. For it is here still a question of two modes of being. All
that has happened is that mechanical energy has been replaced by
spiritual, the discontinuous being of empiricism by being of a ﬂuid
kind, but of which we can say that it ﬂows, describing it in the third

person. By taking the Gestalt as the theme of his reﬂection, the psychologist breaks with psychologism, since the meaning, connection and
‘truth’ of the percept no longer arise from the fortuitous coming
together of our sensations as they are given to us by our psychophysiological nature, but determine the spatial and qualitative values of
these sensations, and are their irreducible conﬁguration.11 It follows
that the transcendental attitude is already implied in the descriptions of
the psychologist, in so far as they are faithful ones. Consciousness as an
object of study presents the peculiarity of not being analysable, even
naïvely, without carrying us beyond common sense postulates. If, for
example, we set out to create a positive psychology of perception,
while still allowing consciousness to be enclosed in the body, and
through it suﬀer the action of a world in itself, we are led to describe
the object and the world as they appear to consciousness, and in this
way to inquire whether this immediately present world, the only one
we know, may not also be the only one of which there is reason to
speak. A psychology is always brought face to face with the problem of
the constitution of the world.
Psychological reﬂection, once begun, then, outruns itself through its
own momentum. Having recognized the originality of phenomena in
relation to the objective world, since it is through them that the objective world is known to us, it is led to integrate with them every possible
object and to try to ﬁnd out how that object is constituted through
them. At the same time the phenomenal ﬁeld becomes a transcendental
ﬁeld. Since it is now the universal focus of knowledge, consciousness
deﬁnitely ceases to be a particular region of being, a certain collection
of ‘mental’ contents; it no longer resides or is no longer conﬁned
within the domain of ‘forms’ which psychological reﬂection had ﬁrst
recognized, but the forms, like all things, exist for it. It can no longer
be a question of describing the world of living experience which it
carries within itself like some opaque datum, it has to be constituted.
The process of making explicit, which had laid bare the ‘lived-through’
world which is prior to the objective one, is put into operation upon
the ‘lived-through’ world itself, thus revealing, prior to the phenomenal ﬁeld, the transcendental ﬁeld. The system ‘self-others-world’ is in

its turn taken as an object of analysis and it is now a matter of awakening the thoughts which constitute other people, myself as individual
subject and the world as a pole of my perception. This new ‘reduction’
would then recognize only one true subject, the thinking Ego. This
move from naturata to naturans, from constituted to constituting, would
complete the thematizing begun by psychology and would leave nothing implicit or tacitly accepted in my knowledge. It would enable me to
take complete possession of my experience, thus equating thinking and
thought. Such is the ordinary perspective of a transcendental philosophy, and also, to all appearances at least, the programme of a transcendental phenomenology.12 Now the phenomenal ﬁeld as we have
revealed it in this chapter, places a fundamental diﬃculty in the way of
any attempt to make experience directly and totally explicit. It is true
that psychologism has been left behind, that the meaning and structure
of the percept are for us no longer the mere outcome of psychophysiological events, that rationality is no longer a fortunate accident
bringing together dispersed sensations, and that the Gestalt is recognized as primary. But although the Gestalt may be expressible in terms
of some internal law, this law must not be considered as a model on
which the phenomena of structure are built up. Their appearance is not
the external unfolding of a pre-existing reason. It is not because the
‘form’ produces a certain state of equilibrium, solving a problem of
maximum coherence and, in the Kantian sense, making a world possible, that it enjoys a privileged place in our perception; it is the very
appearance of the world and not the condition of its possibility; it is
the birth of a norm and is not realized according to a norm; it is the
identity of the external and the internal and not the projection of the
internal in the external. Although, then, it is not the outcome of some
circulation of mental states in themselves, neither is it an idea. The
Gestalt of a circle is not its mathematical law but its physiognomy. The
recognition of phenomena as an original order is a condemnation of
empiricism as an explanation of order and reason in terms of a coming
together of facts and of natural accidents, but it leaves reason and order
themselves with the character of facticity. If a universal constituting
12

It is set forth in these terms in most of Husserl’s works, even in those published during
his last period.

the phenomenal field

consciousness were possible, the opacity of the fact would disappear. If
then we want reﬂection to maintain, in the object on which it bears, its
descriptive characteristics, and thoroughly to understand that object,
we must not consider it as a mere return to a universal reason and see it
as anticipated in unreﬂective experience, we must regard it as a creative
operation which itself participates in the facticity of that experience.
That is why phenomenology, alone of all philosophies, talks about a
transcendental ﬁeld. This word indicates that reﬂection never holds,
arrayed and objectiﬁed before its gaze, the whole world and the plurality of monads, and that its view is never other than partial and of
limited power. It is also why phenomenology is phenomenology, that
is, a study of the advent of being to consciousness, instead of presuming
its possibility as given in advance. It is striking how transcendental
philosophies of the classical type never question the possibility of
eﬀecting the complete disclosure which they always assume done somewhere. It is enough for them that it should be necessary, and in this way
they judge what is by what ought to be, by what the idea of knowledge
requires. In fact, the thinking Ego can never abolish its inherence in an
individual subject, which knows all things in a particular perspective.
Reﬂection can never make me stop seeing the sun two hundred yards
away on a misty day, or seeing it ‘rise’ and ‘set’, or thinking with the
cultural apparatus with which my education, my previous eﬀorts, my
personal history, have provided me. I never actually collect together, or
call up simultaneously, all the primary thoughts which contribute to
my perception or to my present conviction. A critical philosophy
attaches in the last analysis no importance to this resistance oﬀered by
passivity, as if it were not necessary to become the transcendental
subject in order to have the right to aﬃrm it. It tacitly assumes, consequently, that the philosopher’s thinking is not conditioned by any
situation. Starting from the spectacle of the world, which is that of a
nature open to a plurality of thinking subjects, it looks for the conditions which make possible this unique world presented to a number of
empirical selves, and ﬁnds it in a transcendental ego in which they
participate without dividing it up, because it is not a Being, but a Unity
or a Value. This is why the problem of the knowledge of other people is
never posed in Kantian philosophy: the transcendental ego which it
discusses is just as much other people’s as mine, analysis is from the

71

72

phenomenology of perception

start located outside me, and has nothing to do but to determine the
general conditions which make possible a world for an ego—myself or
others equally—and so it never comes up against the question: who is
thinking? If on the other hand contemporary philosophy takes this as its
main theme, and if other people become a problem for it, it is because
it is trying to achieve a more radical self-discovery. Reﬂection cannot
be thorough-going, or bring a complete elucidation of its object, if it
does not arrive at awareness of itself as well as of its results. We must
not only adopt a reﬂective attitude, in an impregnable Cogito, but furthermore reﬂect on this reﬂection, understand the natural situation
which it is conscious of succeeding and which is therefore part of its
deﬁnition; not merely practise philosophy, but realize the transformation which it brings with it in the spectacle of the world and in our
existence. Only on this condition can philosophical knowledge become
absolute knowledge, and cease to be a speciality or a technique. So
there will be no assertion of an absolute Unity, all the less doubtful for
not having had to come into Being. The core of philosophy is no longer
an autonomous transcendental subjectivity, to be found everywhere
and nowhere: it lies in the perpetual beginning of reﬂection, at the
point where an individual life begins to reﬂect on itself. Reﬂection is
truly reﬂection only if it is not carried outside itself, only if it knows
itself as reﬂection-on-an-unreﬂective-experience, and consequently as
a change in structure of our existence. We earlier attacked Bergsonian
intuitionism and introspection for seeking to know by coinciding. But
at the opposite extremity of philosophy, in the notion of a universal
constituting consciousness, we encounter an exactly corresponding
mistake. Bergson’s mistake consists in believing that the thinking
subject can become fused with the object thought about, and that
knowledge can swell and be incorporated into being. The mistake of
reﬂective philosophies is to believe that the thinking subject can absorb
into its thinking or appropriate without remainder the object of its
thought, that our being can be brought down to our knowledge. As
thinking subject we are never the unreﬂective subject that we seek to
know; but neither can we become wholly consciousness, or make ourselves into the transcendental consciousness. If we were consciousness,
we would have to have before us the world, our history and perceived
objects in their uniqueness as systems of transparent relationships.

the phenomenal field

Now even when we are not dealing with psychology, when we try to
comprehend, in direct reﬂection and without the help of the varied
associations of inductive thought, what a perceived movement, or a
circle, are, we can elucidate this singular fact only by varying it somewhat through the agency of imagination, and then fastening our
thought upon the invariable element of this mental experience. We can
get through to the individual only by the hybrid procedure of ﬁnding
an example, that is, by stripping it of its facticity. Thus it is questionable
whether thought can ever quite cease to be inductive, and whether it
can assimilate any experience to the point of taking up and appropriating its whole texture. A philosophy becomes transcendental, or radical,
not by taking its place in absolute consciousness without mentioning
the ways by which this is reached, but by considering itself as a problem; not by postulating a knowledge rendered totally explicit, but by
recognizing as the fundamental philosophic problem this presumption on
reason’s part.
That is why we had to begin our examination of perception with
psychological considerations. If we had not done so, we would not
have understood the whole meaning of the transcendental problem,
since we would not, starting from the natural attitude, have methodically followed the procedures which lead to it. We had to frequent the
phenomenal ﬁeld and become acquainted, through psychological
descriptions, with the subject of phenomena. if we were to avoid placing ourselves from the start, as does reﬂexive philosophy, in a transcendental dimension assumed to be eternally given, thus by-passing
the full problem of constitution. We could not begin, however, our
psychological description without suggesting that once purged of all
psychologism it can become a philosophical method. In order to revive
perceptual experience buried under its own results, it would not have
been enough to present descriptions of them which might possibly not
have been understood, we had to establish by philosophical references
and anticipations the point of view from which they might appear true.
Thus we could begin neither without psychology nor with psychology
alone. Experience anticipates a philosophy and philosophy is merely an
elucidated experience. But now that the phenomenal ﬁeld has been
suﬃciently circumscribed, let us enter this ambiguous domain and let
us make sure of our ﬁrst steps as far as the psychologist is concerned,

73

74

phenomenology of perception

until the psychologist’s self-scrutiny leads us, by way of a second-order
reﬂection, to the phenomenon of the phenomenon, and decisively
transforms the phenomenal ﬁeld into a transcendental one.

Part I
The Body

EXPERIENCE AND
OBJECTIVE THOUGHT
The problem of the body
Our perception ends in objects, and the object once constituted,
appears as the reason for all the experiences of it which we have had
or could have. For example, I see the next-door house from a certain
angle, but it would be seen diﬀerently from the right bank of the
Seine, or from the inside, or again from an aeroplane: the house itself
is none of these appearances: it is, as Leibnitz said, the geometrized
projection of these perspectives and of all possible perspectives, that
is, the perspectiveless position from which all can be derived, the
house seen from nowhere. But what do these words mean? Is not to
see always to see from somewhere? To say that the house itself is seen
from nowhere is surely to say that it is invisible! Yet when I say that I
see the house with my own eyes, I am saying something that cannot
be challenged; I do not mean that my retina and crystalline lens, my
eyes as material organs, go into action and cause me to see it; with
only myself to consult, I can know nothing about this. I am trying to
express in this way a certain manner of approaching the object,
the ‘gaze’ in short, which is as indubitable as my own thought, as

78

phenomenology of perception

directly known by me. We must try to understand how vision can be
brought into being from somewhere without being enclosed in its
perspective.
To see an object is either to have it on the fringe of the visual ﬁeld
and be able to concentrate on it, or else respond to this summons by
actually concentrating upon it. When I do concentrate my eyes on it, I
become anchored in it, but this coming to rest of the gaze is merely a
modality of its movement: I continue inside one object the exploration
which earlier hovered over them all, and in one movement I close up
the landscape and open the object. The two operations do not fortuitously coincide: it is not the contingent aspects of my bodily make-up,
for example the retinal structure, which force me to see my surroundings vaguely if I want to see the object clearly. Even if I knew nothing of
rods and cones, I should realize that it is necessary to put the surroundings in abeyance the better to see the object, and to lose in background
what one gains in focal ﬁgure, because to look at the object is to plunge
oneself into it, and because objects form a system in which one cannot
show itself without concealing others. More precisely, the inner horizon of an object cannot become an object without the surrounding
objects’ becoming a horizon, and so vision is an act with two facets.
For I do not identify the detailed object which I now have with that
over which my gaze ran a few minutes ago, by expressly comparing
these details with a memory of my ﬁrst general view. When, in a ﬁlm,
the camera is trained on an object and moves nearer to it to give a
close-up view, we can remember that we are being shown the ash tray or
an actor’s hand, we do not actually identify it. This is because the
screen has no horizons. In normal vision, on the other hand, I direct
my gaze upon a sector of the landscape, which comes to life and is
disclosed, while the other objects recede into the periphery and
become dormant, while, however, not ceasing to be there. Now, with
them, I have at my disposal their horizons, in which there is implied, as
a marginal view, the object on which my eyes at present fall. The
horizon, then, is what guarantees the identity of the object throughout
the exploration; it is the correlative of the impending power which my
gaze retains over the objects which it has just surveyed, and which it
already has over the fresh details which it is about to discover. No
distinct memory and no explicit conjecture could ﬁll this rôle: they

experience and objective thought

would give only a probable synthesis, whereas my perception presents
itself as actual. The object-horizon structure, or the perspective,
is no obstacle to me when I want to see the object: for just as it is
the means whereby objects are distinguished from each other, it is
also the means whereby they are disclosed. To see is to enter a universe
of beings which display themselves, and they would not do this if they
could not be hidden behind each other or behind me. In other words:
to look at an object is to inhabit it, and from this habitation to grasp all
things in terms of the aspect which they present to it. But in so far as I
see those things too, they remain abodes open to my gaze, and, being
potentially lodged in them, I already perceive from various angles the
central object of my present vision. Thus every object is the mirror of
all others. When I look at the lamp on my table, I attribute to it not only
the qualities visible from where I am, but also those which the chimney, the walls, the table can ‘see’; but back of my lamp is nothing but
the face which it ‘shows’ to the chimney. I can therefore see an object
in so far as objects form a system or a world, and in so far as each one
treats the others round it as spectators of its hidden aspects and as
guarantee of the permanence of those aspects. Any seeing of an object
by me is instantaneously reiterated among all those objects in the
world which are apprehended as co-existent, because each of them is
all that the others ‘see’ of it. Our previous formula must therefore be
modiﬁed; the house itself is not the house seen from nowhere, but the
house seen from everywhere. The completed object is translucent,
being shot through from all sides by an inﬁnite number of present
scrutinies which intersect in its depths leaving nothing hidden.
What we have just said about the spatial perspective could equally be
said about the temporal. If I contemplate the house attentively and with
no thought in my mind, it has something eternal about it, and an
atmosphere of torpor seems to be generated by it. It is true that I see it
from a certain point in my ‘duration’, but it is the same house that I
saw yesterday when it was a day younger: it is the same house that
either an old man or a child might behold. It is true, moreover, that age
and change aﬀect it, but even if it should collapse tomorrow, it will
remain for ever true that it existed today: each moment of time calls
all the others to witness; it shows by its advent ‘how things were meant
to turn out’ and ‘how it will all ﬁnish’; each present permanently

79

80

phenomenology of perception

underpins a point of time which calls for recognition from all the
others, so that the object is seen at all times as it is seen from all
directions and by the same means, namely the structure imposed by a
horizon. The present still holds on to the immediate past without
positing it as an object, and since the immediate past similarly holds its
immediate predecessor, past time is wholly collected up and grasped in
the present. The same is true of the imminent future which will also
have its horizon of imminence. But with my immediate past I have also
the horizon of futurity which surrounded it, and thus I have my actual
present seen as the future of that past. With the imminent future, I have
the horizon of past which will surround it, and therefore my actual
present as the past of that future. Thus, through the double horizon of
retention and protention, my present may cease to be a factual present
quickly carried away and abolished by the ﬂow of duration, and
become a ﬁxed and identiﬁable point in objective time.
But, once more, my human gaze never posits more than one facet of
the object, even though by means of horizons it is directed towards all
the others. It can never come up against previous appearances or those
presented to other people otherwise than through the intermediary of
time and language. If I conceive in the image of my own gaze those
others which, converging from all directions, explore every corner of
the house and deﬁne it, I have still only a harmonious and indeﬁnite set
of views of the object, but not the object in its plenitude. In the same
way, although my present draws into itself time past and time to come,
it possesses them only in intention, and even if, for example, the consciousness of my past which I now have seems to me to cover exactly
the past as it was, the past which I claim to recapture is not the real past,
but my past as I now see it, perhaps after altering it. Similarly in the
future I may have a mistaken idea about the present which I now
experience. Thus the synthesis of horizons is no more than a presumptive synthesis, operating with certainty and precision only in the
immediate vicinity of the object. The remoter surrounding is no longer
within my grasp; it is no longer composed of still discernible objects or
memories; it is an anonymous horizon now incapable of bringing any
precise testimony, and leaving the object as incomplete and open as it
is indeed, in perceptual experience. Through this opening, indeed, the
substantiality of the object slips away. If it is to reach perfect density, in

experience and objective thought

other words if there is to be an absolute object, it will have to consist of
an inﬁnite number of diﬀerent perspectives compressed into a strict
co-existence, and to be presented as it were to a host of eyes all engaged
in one concerted act of seeing. The house has its water pipes, its ﬂoor,
perhaps its cracks which are insidiously spreading in the thickness of
its ceilings. We never see them, but it has them along with its chimneys
and windows which we can see. We shall forget our present perception
of the house: every time we are able to compare our memories with the
objects to which they refer, we are surprised, even allowing for other
sources of error, at the changes which they owe to their own duration.
But we still believe that there is a truth about the past; we base our
memory on the world’s vast Memory, in which the house has its place
as it really was on that day, and which guarantees its being at this
moment. Taken in itself—and as an object it demands to be taken
thus—the object has nothing cryptic about it; it is completely displayed
and its parts co-exist while our gaze runs from one to another, its
present does not cancel its past, nor will its future cancel its present.
The positing of the object therefore makes us go beyond the limits of
our actual experience which is brought up against and halted by an
alien being, with the result that ﬁnally experience believes that it
extracts all its own teaching from the object. It is this ek-stase* of
experience which causes all perception to be perception of something.
Obsessed with being, and forgetful of the perspectivism of my
experience, I henceforth treat it as an object and deduce it from a
relationship between objects. I regard my body, which is my point of
view upon the world, as one of the objects of that world. My recent
awareness of my gaze as a means of knowledge I now repress, and treat
my eyes as bits of matter. They then take their place in the same objective space in which I am trying to situate the external object and I
believe that I am producing the perceived perspective by the projection
of the objects on my retina. In the same way I treat my own perceptual
history as a result of my relationships with the objective world; my
present, which is my point of view on time, becomes one moment of
* Active transcendence of the subject in relation to the world. The author uses either the
French word extase, or Heidegger’s form ek-stase. The latter is the one used throughout this
translation (Translator’s note).

81

82

phenomenology of perception

time among all the others, my duration a reﬂection or abstract aspect of
universal time, as my body is a mode of objective space. In the same
way, ﬁnally, if the objects which surround the house or which are
found in it remained what they are in perceptual experience, that is,
acts of seeing conditioned by a certain perspective, the house would
not be posited as an autonomous being. Thus the positing of one single
object, in the full sense, demands the compositive bringing into being
of all these experiences in one act of manifold creation. Therein it
exceeds perceptual experience and the synthesis of horizons—as the
notion of a universe, that is to say, a completed and explicit totality, in
which the relationships are those of reciprocal determination, exceeds
that of a world, or an open and indeﬁnite multiplicity of relationships
which are of reciprocal implication.1 I detach myself from my experience and pass to the idea. Like the object, the idea purports to be the
same for everybody, valid in all times and places, and the individuation
of an object in an objective point of time and space ﬁnally appears as
the expression of a universal positing power.2 I am no longer concerned with my body, nor with time, nor with the world, as I experience them in antepredicative knowledge, in the inner communion that
I have with them. I now refer to my body only as an idea, to the
universe as idea, to the idea of space and the idea of time. Thus ‘objective’ thought (in Kierkegaard’s sense) is formed—being that of common sense and of science—which ﬁnally causes us to lose contact with
perceptual experience, of which it is nevertheless the outcome and the
natural sequel. The whole life of consciousness is characterized by the
tendency to posit objects, since it is consciousness, that is to say selfknowledge, only in so far as it takes hold of itself and draws itself
together in an identiﬁable object. And yet the absolute positing of a
single object is the death of consciousness, since it congeals the whole
of existence, as a crystal placed in a solution suddenly crystallizes it.
We cannot remain in this dilemma of having to fail to understand
either the subject or the object. We must discover the origin of the
object at the very centre of our experience; we must describe the

emergence of being and we must understand how, paradoxically, there
is for us an in-itself. In order not to prejudge the issue, we shall take
objective thought on its own terms and not ask it any questions which
it does not ask itself. If we are led to rediscover experience behind it,
this shift of ground will be attributable only to the diﬃculties which
objective thought itself raises. Let us consider it then at work in the
constitution of our body as object, since this is a crucial moment in the
genesis of the objective world. It will be seen that one’s own body
evades, even within science itself, the treatment to which it is intended
to subject it. And since the genesis of the objective body is only a
moment in the constitution of the object, the body, by withdrawing
from the objective world, will carry with it the intentional threads
linking it to its surrounding and ﬁnally reveal to us the perceiving
subject as the perceived world.

1
THE BODY AS OBJECT AND
MECHANISTIC PHYSIOLOGY
The deﬁnition of the object is, as we have seen, that it exists partes extra
partes, and that consequently it acknowledges between its parts, or
between itself and other objects only external and mechanical relationships, whether in the narrow sense of motion received and transmitted,
or in the wider sense of the relation of function to variable. Where it
was desired to insert the organism in the universe of objects and
thereby close oﬀ that universe, it was necessary to translate the functioning of the body into the language of the initself and discover,
beneath behaviour, the linear dependence of stimulus and receptor,
receptor and Empﬁnder.1 It was of course realized that in the circuit of
behaviour new particular forms emerge, and the theory of speciﬁc
nervous energy, for example, certainly endowed the organism with the
power of transforming the physical world. But in fact it attributed to
the nervous systems the occult power of creating the diﬀerent structures of our experience, and whereas sight, touch and hearing are so
many ways of gaining access to the object, these structures found
themselves transformed into compact qualities derived from the local
distinction between the organs used. Thus the relationship between
1

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

stimulus and perception could remain clear and objective, and the
psycho-physical event was of the same kind as the causal relations
obtaining ‘in the world’. Modern physiology no longer has recourse to
these pretences. It no longer links the diﬀerent qualities of one and the
same sense, and the data of diﬀerent senses, to distinct material
instruments. In reality injuries to centres and even to conductors are
not translated into the loss of certain qualities of sensation or of certain
sensory data, but into loss of diﬀerentiation in the function. We have
already discussed this: wherever the seat of the injury in the sensory
routes and whatever its origin, one observes, for example, a decay of
sensitivity to colour; at the beginning, all colours are aﬀected, their
basic shade remaining the same, but their saturation decreasing; then
the spectrum is simpliﬁed and reduced to four colours: yellow, green,
blue, crimson, and indeed all short-wave colours tend towards a kind
of blue, all long-wave colours towards a kind of yellow, vision being
liable, moreover, to vary from moment to moment, according to
degree of fatigue. Finally a monochrome stage in grey is reached,
although favourable conditions (contrast, long exposure) may
momentarily bring back dichromic sight.2 The progress of the lesion in
the nervous tissue does not, therefore, destroy, one after another,
ready-made sensory contents, but makes the active diﬀerentiation of
stimuli, which appears to be the essential function of the nervous
system, increasingly unreliable. In the same way, in the case of noncortical injury to the sense of touch, if certain contents (temperatures)
are more easily destroyed and are the ﬁrst to disappear, this is not
because a determinate region, lost to the patient, enables us to feel heat
and cold, since the speciﬁc sensation will be restored if a suﬃciently
extensive stimulus is applied;3 it is rather that the sensation succeeds in
taking its typical form only under a more energetic stimulus. Central
lesions seem to leave qualities intact; on the other hand they modify the
spatial organization of data and the perception of objects. This is what
had led to the belief in specialized gnosic centres for the localization
and interpretation of qualities. In fact, modern research shows that
central lesions have the eﬀect in most cases of raising the chronaxies,

which are increased to two or three times their normal strength in the
patient. The excitation produces its eﬀects more slowly, these survive
longer, and the tactile perception of roughness, for example, is jeopardized in so far as it presupposes a succession of circumscribed impressions or a precise consciousness of the diﬀerent positions of the hand.4
The vague localization of the stimulus is not explained by the destruction of a localizing centre, but by the reduction to a uniform level of
sensations, which are no longer capable of organizing themselves into
a stable grouping in which each of them receives a univocal value and
is translated into consciousness only by a limited change.5 Thus
the excitations of one and the same sense diﬀer less by reason of the
material instrument which they use than in the way in which the
elementary stimuli are spontaneously organized among themselves,
and this organization is the crucial factor both at the level of sensible
‘qualities’ and at that of perception. It is this, and not the speciﬁc
energy of the nervous apparatus examined, which causes an excitant to
give rise to a tactile or thermic sensation. If a given area of skin is
several times stimulated with a hair, the ﬁrst perceptions are clearly
distinguished and localized each time at the same point. As the stimulus is repeated, the localization becomes less precise, perception
widens in space, while at the same time the sensation ceases to be
speciﬁc: it is no longer a contact, but a feeling of burning, at one
moment cold and at the next hot. Later still the patient thinks the
stimulus is moving and describing a circle on his skin. Finally nothing
more is felt.6 It follows that the ‘sensible quality’, the spatial limits set
to the percept, and even the presence or absence of a perception, are
not de facto eﬀects of the situation outside the organism, but represent
the way in which it meets stimulation and is related to it. An excitation
is not perceived when it strikes a sensory organ which is not ‘attuned’
to it.7 The function of the organism in receiving stimuli is, so to speak,

to ‘conceive’ a certain form of excitation.8 The ‘psychophysical event’
is therefore no longer of the type of ‘worldly’ causality, the brain
becomes the seat of a process of ‘patterning’ which intervenes even
before the cortical stage, and which, from the moment the nervous
system comes into play, confuses the relations of stimulus to organism.
The excitation is seized and reorganized by transversal functions which
make it resemble the perception which it is about to arouse. I cannot
envisage this form which is traced out in the nervous system, this
exhibiting of a structure, as a set of processes in the third person, as the
transmission of movement or as the determination of one variable by
another. I cannot gain a removed knowledge of it. In so far as I guess
what it may be, it is by abandoning the body as an object, partes extra
partes, and by going back to the body which I experience at this
moment, in the manner, for example, in which my hand moves round
the object it touches, anticipating the stimuli and itself tracing out the
form which I am about to perceive. I cannot understand the function of
the living body except by enacting it myself, and except in so far as I am
a body which rises towards the world.
Thus exteroceptivity demands that stimuli be given a shape; the
consciousness of the body invades the body, the soul spreads over all its
parts, and behaviour overspills its central sector. But one might reply
that this ‘bodily experience’ is itself a ‘representation’, a ‘psychic fact’,
and that as such it is at the end of a chain of physical and physiological
events which alone can be ascribed to the ‘real body’. Is not my body,
exactly as are external bodies, an object which acts on receptors and
ﬁnally gives rise to the consciousness of the body? Is there not an
‘interoceptivity’ just as there is an ‘exteroceptivity’? Cannot I ﬁnd in
the body message-wires sent by the internal organs to the brain, which
are installed by nature to provide the soul with the opportunity of
feeling its body? Consciousness of the body, and the soul, are thus
repressed. The body becomes the highly polished machine which the
ambiguous notion of behaviour nearly made us forget. For example, if,
in the case of a man who has lost a leg, a stimulus is applied, instead of
to the leg, to the path from the stump to the brain, the subject will feel
8

87

a phantom leg, because the soul is immediately linked to the brain and
to it alone.
What has modern physiology to say about this? Anaesthesia with
cocaine does not do away with the phantom limb, and there are cases
of phantom limbs without amputation as a result of brain injury.9
Finally the imaginary limb is often found to retain the position in
which the real arm was at the moment of injury: a man wounded in
battle can still feel in his phantom arm the shell splinters that lacerated
his real one.10 Is it then necessary to abandon the ‘peripheral theory’ in
favour of a ‘central theory’? But a central theory would get us no
further if it added no more to the peripheral conditions of the imaginary limb than cerebral symptoms. For a collection of cerebral symptoms could not represent the relationships in consciousness which
enter into the phenomenon. It depends indeed on ‘psychic’ determinants. An emotion, circumstance which recalls those in which the
wound was received, creates a phantom limb in subjects who had
none.11 It happens that the imaginary arm is enormous after the operation, but that it subsequently shrinks and is absorbed into the stump
‘as the patient consents to accept his mutilation’.12 The phenomenon of
the phantom limb is here elucidated by that of anosognosia,* which
clearly demands a psychological explanation. Subjects who systematically ignore their paralysed right hand, and hold out their left hand
when asked for their right, refer to their paralysed arm as ‘a long, cold
snake’, which rules out any hypothesis of real anaesthesia and suggests
one in terms of the refusal to recognize their deﬁciency.13 Must we
then conclude that the phantom limb is a memory, a volition or a
belief, and, failing any physiological explanation, must we provide a
psychological explanation for it? But no psychological explanation can

overlook the fact that the severance of the nerves to the brain abolishes
the phantom limb.14
What has to be understood, then, is how the psychic determining
factors and the physiological conditions gear into each other: it is not
clear how the imaginary limb, if dependent on physiological conditions and therefore the result of a third person causality, can in another
context arise out of the personal history of the patient, his memories,
emotions and volitions. For in order that the two sets of conditions
might together bring about the phenomenon, as two components
bring about a resultant, they would need an identical point of application or a common ground, and it is diﬃcult to see what ground could
be common to ‘physiological facts’ which are in space and ‘psychic
facts’ which are nowhere: or even to objective processes like nervous
inﬂuxes which belong to the realm of the in-itself, and cogitations such as
acceptance and refusal, awareness of the past, and emotion, which are
of the order of the for-itself. A hybrid theory of the phantom limb which
found a place for both sets of conditions15 may, then, be valid as a
statement of the known facts; but it is fundamentally obscure. The
phantom limb is not the mere outcome of objective causality; no more
is it a cogitatio. It could be a mixture of the two only if we could ﬁnd a
means of linking the ‘psychic’ and the ‘physiological’, the ‘for-itself ’
and the ‘in-itself’, to each other to form an articulate whole, and to
contrive some meeting-point for them: if the third person processes
and the personal acts could be integrated into a common middle term.
In order to describe the belief in the phantom limb and the
unwillingness to accept mutilation, writers speak of a ‘driving into the
unconscious’ or ‘an organic repression’.16 These un-Cartesian terms
force us to form the idea of an organic thought through which the
relation of the ‘psychic’ to the ‘physiological’ becomes conceivable. We
have already met elsewhere, in the case of substitutions, phenomena
which lie outside the alternatives of psychic and physiological, of ﬁnal

The phantom limb lends itself neither to a purely physiological explanation, nor to a
purely psychological one. Such is the conclusion of J. Lhermitte, L’Image de notre Corps,

and mechanistic causes.17 When the insect, in the performance of an
instinctive act, substitutes a sound leg for one cut oﬀ, it is not, as we
saw, that a stand-by device, set up in advance, is automatically put into
operation and substituted for the circuit which is out of action. But
neither is it the case that the creature is aware of an aim to be achieved,
using its limbs as various means, for in that case the substitution ought
to occur every time the act is prevented, and we know that it does not
occur if the leg is merely tied. The insect simply continues to belong to
the same world and moves in it with all its powers. The tied limb is not
replaced by the free one, because it continues to count in the insect’s
scheme of things, and because the current of activity which ﬂows
towards the world still passes through it. There is in this instance no
more choice than in the case of a drop of oil which uses all its strength
to solve in practical terms the maximum and minimum problem
which confronts it. The diﬀerence is simply that the drop of oil adapts
itself to given external forces, while the insect itself projects the norms
of its environment and itself lays down the terms of its vital problem;18
but here it is a question of an a priori of the species and not a personal
choice. Thus what is found behind the phenomenon of substitution is
the impulse of being-in-the-world, and it is now time to put this
notion into more precise terms. When we say that an animal exists, that
it has a world, or that it belongs to a world, we do not mean that it has a
perception or objective consciousness of that world. The situation
which unleashes instinctive operations is not entirely articulate and
determinate, its total meaning is not possessed, as is adequately shown
by the mistakes and the blindness of instinct. It presents only a practical
signiﬁcance; it asks for only bodily recognition; it is experienced as an
‘open’ situation, and ‘requires’ the animal’s movements, just as the ﬁrst
notes of a melody require a certain kind of resolution, without its
being known in itself, and it is precisely what allows the limbs to be
substituted for each other, and to be of equal value before the selfevident demands of the task. In so far as it anchors the subject to a
certain ‘environment’, is ‘being-in-the-world’ something like ‘attention to life’ in Bergson or ‘the function of the real’ in P. Janet? Attention
17

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

to life is the awareness we experience of ‘nascent movements’ in our
bodies. Now reﬂex movements, whether adumbrated or executed, are
still only objective processes whose course and results consciousness
can observe, but in which it is not involved.19 In fact the reﬂexes
themselves are never blind processes: they adjust themselves to a ‘direction’ of the situation, and express our orientation towards a
‘behavioural setting’ just as much as the action of the ‘geographical
setting’ upon us. They trace out from a distance the structure of the
object without waiting for its point by point stimulation. It is this
global presence of the situation which gives a meaning to the partial
stimuli and causes them to acquire importance, value or existence for
the organism. The reﬂex does not arise from objective stimuli, but
19

When Bergson stresses the unity of perception and action and invents, for its expression, the term ‘sensory-motor process’, he is clearly seeking to involve consciousness in
the world. But if feeling is representing a quality to oneself, and if movement is changing
one’s position in the objective world, then between sensation and movement, even taken
in their nascent state, no compromise is possible, and they are distinct from each other as are
the for-itself and the in-itself. Generally speaking, Bergson saw that the body and the mind
communicate with each other through the medium of time, that to be a mind is to stand
above time’s ﬂow and that to have a body is to have a present. The body, he says, is an
instantaneous section made in the becoming of consciousness (Matière et Mémoire, p. 150).
But the body remains for him what we have called the objective body; consciousness
remains knowledge; time remains a successive ‘now’, whether it ‘snowballs upon itself’
or is spread in spatialized time. Bergson can therefore only compress or expand the series
of ‘present moments’; he never reaches the unique movement whereby the three dimensions of time are constituted, and one cannot see why duration is squeezed into a
present, or why consciousness becomes involved in a body and a world.
As for the ‘function of the real’, P. Janet uses it as an existential notion. This is what
enables him to sketch out a profound theory of emotion as the collapse of our customary
being, and a ﬂight from our world. (Cf. for example the interpretation of the ﬁt of
hysterics, De l’Angoisse à l’Extase, T. II, p. 450 and ﬀ.) But this theory of emotion is not
followed out and, as J. P. Sartre shows, it conﬂicts, in the writings of P. Janet, with a
mechanistic conception rather close to that of James: the collapse of our existence into
emotion is treated as a mere derivation from psychological forces, and the emotion itself as
the consciousness of this process expressed in the third person, so that there is no longer
reason to look for a meaning in the emotional behaviour which is the result of the blind
momentum of the tendencies, and we return to dualism. (Cf. J. P. Sartre, Esquisse d’une théorie
de l’Emotion.) P. Janet, moreover, treats psychological tension—that is, the movement
whereby we spread our ‘world’ before us—expressly as a representative hypothesis; so
he is far from considering it in general terms as the concrete essence of man, though he
does so implicitly in particular analyses.

moves back towards them, and invests them with a meaning which
they do not possess taken singly as psychological agents, but only when
taken as a situation. It causes them to exist as a situation, it stands in a
‘cognitive’ relation to them, which means that it shows them up as that
which it is destined to confront. The reﬂex, in so far as it opens itself to
the meaning of a situation, and perception; in so far as it does not ﬁrst
of all posit an object of knowledge and is an intention of our whole
being, are modalities of a pre-objective view which is what we call beingin-the-world. Prior to stimuli and sensory contents, we must recognize
a kind of inner diaphragm which determines, inﬁnitely more than they
do, what our reﬂexes and perceptions will be able to aim at in the
world, the area of our possible operations, the scope of our life. Some
subjects can come near to blindness without changing their ‘world’:
they can be seen colliding with objects everywhere, but they are not
aware of no longer being open to visual qualities, and the structure of
their conduct remains unmodiﬁed. Other patients, on the other hand,
lose their world as soon as its contents are removed; they abandon their
habitual way of life even before it has become impossible, making
themselves into premature invalids and breaking their vital contact
with the world before losing sensory contact with it. There is, then, a
certain consistency in our ‘world’, relatively independent of stimuli,
which refuses to allow us to treat being-in-the-world as a collection of
reﬂexes—a certain energy in the pulsation of existence, relatively
independent of our voluntary thoughts, which prevents us from treating it as an act of consciousness. It is because it is a preobjective view
that being-in-the-world can be distinguished from every third person
process, from every modality of the res extensa, as from every cogitatio,
from every ﬁrst person form of knowledge—and that it can eﬀect the
union of the ‘psychic’ and the ‘physiological’.
Let us return now to the problem with which we began. Anosognosia and the phantom limb lend themselves neither to a physiological
nor to a psychological explanation, nor yet to a mixture of the two,
though they can be related to the two sets of conditions. A physiological explanation would account for anosognosia and the phantom
limb as the straightforward suppression or equally straightforward persistence of ‘interoceptive’ stimulations. According to this hypothesis,
anosognosia is the absence of a fragment of representation which

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

ought to be given, since the corresponding limb is there; the phantom
limb is the presence of part of the representation of the body which
should not be given, since the corresponding limb is not there. If one
now gives a psychological account of the phenomena, the phantom
limb becomes a memory, a positive judgement or a perception, while
anosognosia becomes a bit of forgetfulness, a negative judgement or a
failure to perceive. In the ﬁrst case the phantom limb is the actual
presence of a representation, anosognosia the actual absence of a representation. In the second case the phantom limb is the representation of
an actual presence, whereas anosognosia is the representation of an
actual absence. In both cases we are imprisoned in the categories of the
objective world, in which there is no middle term between presence
and absence. In reality the anosognosic is not simply ignorant of the
existence of his paralysed limb: he can evade his deﬁciency only
because he knows where he risks encountering it, just as the subject, in
psychoanalysis, knows what he does not want to face, otherwise he
would not be able to avoid it so successfully. We do not understand the
absence or death of a friend until the time comes when we expect a
reply from him and when we realize that we shall never again receive
one; so at ﬁrst we avoid asking in order not to have to notice this
silence; we turn aside from those areas of our life in which we might
meet this nothingness, but this very fact necessitates that we intuit
them. In the same way the anosognosic leaves his paralysed arm out of
account in order not to have to feel his handicap, but this means that he
has a preconscious knowledge of it. It is true that in the case of the
phantom limb the subject appears to be unaware of the mutilation and
relies on his imaginary limb as he would on a real one, since he tries to
walk with his phantom leg and is not discouraged even by a fall. But he
can describe quite well, in spite of this, the peculiarities of the
phantom leg, for example its curious motility, and if he treats it in
practice as a real limb, this is because, like the normal subject, he has no
need, when he wants to set oﬀ walking, of a clear and articulate perception of his body: it is enough for him to have it ‘at his disposal’ as an
undivided power, and to sense the phantom limb as vaguely involved in
it. The consciousness of the phantom limb remains, then, itself unclear.
The man with one leg feels the missing limb in the same way as I feel
keenly the existence of a friend who is, nevertheless, not before my

93

94

phenomenology of perception

eyes; he has not lost it because he continues to allow for it, just as
Proust can recognize the death of his grandmother, yet without losing
her, as long as he can keep her on the horizon of his life. The phantom
arm is not a representation of the arm, but the ambivalent presence of
an arm. The refusal of mutilation in the case of the phantom limb, or
the refusal of disablement in anosognosia are not deliberate decisions,
and do not take place at the level of positing consciousness which takes
up its position explicitly after considering various possibilities. The
will to have a sound body or the rejection of an inﬁrm one are not
formulated for themselves; and the awareness of the amputated arm
as present or of the disabled arm as absent is not of the kind: ‘I think
that . . .’
This phenomenon, distorted equally by physiological and psychological explanations, is, however, understood in the perspective of
being-in-the-world. What it is in us which refuses mutilation and
disablement is an I committed to a certain physical and inter-human
world, who continues to tend towards his world despite handicaps and
amputations and who, to this extent, does not recognize them de jure.
The refusal of the deﬁciency is only the obverse of our inherence in a
world, the implicit negation of what runs counter to the natural
momentum which throws us into our tasks, our cares, our situation,
our familiar horizons. To have a phantom arm is to remain open to all
the actions of which the arm alone is capable; it is to retain the practical
ﬁeld which one enjoyed before mutilation. The body is the vehicle of
being in the world, and having a body is, for a living creature, to be
intervolved in a deﬁnite environment, to identify oneself with certain
projects and be continually committed to them. In the self-evidence of
this complete world in which manipulatable objects still ﬁgure, in the
force of their movement which still ﬂows towards him, and in which is
still present the project of writing or playing the piano, the cripple still
ﬁnds the guarantee of his wholeness. But in concealing his deﬁciency
from him, the world cannot fail simultaneously to reveal it to him: for
if it is true that I am conscious of my body via the world, that it is the
unperceived term in the centre of the world towards which all objects
turn their face, it is true for the same reason that my body is the pivot of
the world: I know that objects have several facets because I could make
a tour of inspection of them, and in that sense I am conscious of the

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

world through the medium of my body. It is precisely when my customary world arouses in me habitual intentions that I can no longer, if I
have lost a limb, be eﬀectively drawn into it, and the utilizable objects,
precisely in so far as they present themselves as utilizable, appeal to a
hand which I no longer have. Thus are delimited, in the totality of my
body, regions of silence. The patient therefore realizes his disability
precisely in so far as he is ignorant of it, and is ignorant of it precisely
to the extent that he knows of it. This paradox is that of all being in the
world: when I move towards a world I bury my perceptual and practical intentions in objects which ultimately appear prior to and external
to those intentions, and which nevertheless exist for me only in so far
as they arouse in me thoughts or volitions. In the case under consideration, the ambiguity of knowledge amounts to this: our body comprises as it were two distinct layers, that of the habit-body and that of
the body at this moment. In the ﬁrst appear manipulatory movements
which have disappeared from the second, and the problem how I can
have the sensation of still possessing a limb which I no longer have
amounts to ﬁnding out how the habitual body can act as guarantee for
the body at this moment. How can I perceive objects as manipulatable
when I can no longer manipulate them? The manipulatable must have
ceased to be what I am now manipulating, and become what one can
manipulate; it must have ceased to be a thing manipulatable for me and
become a thing manipulatable in itself. Correspondingly, my body must be
apprehended not only in an experience which is instantaneous, peculiar to itself and complete in itself, but also in some general aspect and
in the light of an impersonal being.
In that way the phenomenon of the phantom limb is absorbed into
that of repression, which we shall ﬁnd throwing some light on it. For
repression, to which psycho-analysis refers, consists in the subject’s
entering upon a certain course of action—a love aﬀair, a career, a piece
of work—in his encountering on this course some barrier, and, since
he has the strength neither to surmount the obstacle nor to abandon
the enterprise, he remains imprisoned in the attempt and uses up his
strength indeﬁnitely renewing it in spirit. Time in its passage does not
carry away with it these impossible projects; it does not close up on
traumatic experience; the subject remains open to the same impossible
future, if not in his explicit thoughts, at any rate in his actual being. One

95

96

phenomenology of perception

present among all presents thus acquires an exceptional value; it displaces the others and deprives them of their value as authentic presents.
We continue to be the person who once entered on this adolescent
aﬀair, or the one who once lived in this parental universe. New perceptions, new emotions even, replace the old ones, but this process of
renewal touches only the content of our experience and not its structure. Impersonal time continues its course, but personal time is
arrested. Of course this ﬁxation does not merge into memory; it even
excludes memory in so far as the latter spreads out in front of us, like a
picture, a former experience, whereas this past which remains our true
present does not leave us but remains constantly hidden behind our
gaze instead of being displayed before it. The traumatic experience
does not survive as a representation in the mode of objective consciousness and as a ‘dated’ moment; it is of its essence to survive only
as a manner of being and with a certain degree of generality. I forgo
my constant power of providing myself with ‘worlds’ in the interest of
one of them, and for that very reason this privileged world loses its
substance and eventually becomes no more than a certain dread. All
repression is, then, the transition from ﬁrst person existence to a sort of
abstraction of that existence, which lives on a former experience, or
rather on the memory of having had the memory, and so on, until
ﬁnally only the essential form remains. Now as an advent of the
impersonal, repression is a universal phenomenon, revealing our condition as incarnate beings by relating it to the temporal structure of
being in the world. To the extent that I have ‘sense organs’, a ‘body’,
and ‘psychic functions’ comparable with other men’s, each of the
moments of my experience ceases to be an integrated and strictly
unique totality, in which details exist only in virtue of the whole; I
become the meeting point of a host of ‘causalities’. In so far as I inhabit
a ‘physical world’, in which consistent ‘stimuli’ and typical situations
recur—and not merely the historical world in which situations are
never exactly comparable—my life is made up of rhythms which have
not their reason in what I have chosen to be, but their condition in the
humdrum setting which is mine. Thus there appears round our personal existence a margin of almost impersonal existence, which can be
practically taken for granted, and which I rely on to keep me alive;
round the human world which each of us has made for himself is a

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

world in general terms to which one must ﬁrst of all belong in order to
be able to enclose oneself in the particular context of a love or an
ambition. Just as we speak of repression in the limited sense when I
retain through time one of the momentary worlds through which I
have lived, and make it the formative element of my whole life—so it
can be said that my organism, as a prepersonal cleaving to the general
form of the world, as an anonymous and general existence, plays,
beneath my personal life, the part of an inborn complex. It is not some kind
of inert thing; it too has something of the momentum of existence. It
may even happen when I am in danger that my human situation abolishes my biological one, that my body lends itself without reserve to
action.20 But these moments can be no more than moments,21 and for
most of the time personal existence represses the organism without
being able either to go beyond it or to renounce itself; without, in
other words, being able either to reduce the organism to its existential
self, or itself to the organism. While I am overcome by some grief and
wholly given over to my distress, my eyes already stray in front of me,
and are drawn, despite everything, to some shining object, and thereupon resume their autonomous existence. Following upon that minute
into which we wanted to compress our whole life, time, or at least,
prepersonal time, begins once more to ﬂow, carrying away, if not our
resolution, at least the heartfelt emotions which sustained it. Personal
existence is intermittent and when this tide turns and recedes, decision
can henceforth endow my life with only an artiﬁcially induced signiﬁcance. The fusion of soul and body in the act, the sublimation of
biological into personal existence, and of the natural into the cultural
world is made both possible and precarious by the temporal structure
of our experience. Every present grasps, by stages, through its horizon
of immediate past and near future, the totality of possible time; thus
20

Thus Saint-Exupéry, above Arras, with shells bursting all round him, can no longer feel
as a thing distinct from him his body which shortly before seemed to escape him: ‘It is as
if my life were given to me every second, as if my life became every moment more keenly
felt. I live. I am alive. I am still alive. I am always alive. I am now nothing but a source of
life.’ Pilote de Guerre, p. 174.

‘But it is true that, in the course of my life, when not in the grip of urgency, when my
meaning is not at stake, I can see no more serious problems than those raised by my
body.’ A. de Saint-Exupéry, Pilote de Guerre, p. 169.

97

does it overcome the dispersal of instants, and manage to endow our
past itself with its deﬁnitive meaning, re-integrating into personal
existence even that past of all pasts which the stereotyped patterns of
our organic behaviour seem to suggest as being at the origin of our
volitional being. In this context even reﬂexes have a meaning, and each
individual’s style is still visible in them, just as the beating of the heart
is felt as far away as the body’s periphery. But this power naturally
belongs to all presents, the old no less than the new. Even if we claim to
have a better understanding of our past than it had of itself, it can
always reject our present judgement and shut itself up in its own
autonomous self-evidence. It necessarily does so in so far as I conceive
it as a former present. Each present may claim to solidify our life, and
indeed that is what distinguishes it as the present. In so far as it presents
itself as the totality of being and ﬁlls an instant of consciousness, we
never extricate ourselves completely from it, time never completely
closes over it and it remains like a wound through which our strength
ebbs away. It can now be said that, a fortiori, the speciﬁc past, which our
body is, can be recaptured and taken up by an individual life only
because that life has never transcended it, but secretly nourishes it,
devoting thereto part of its strength, because its present is still that past.
This can be seen in cases of illness in which bodily events become the
events of the day. What enables us to centre our existence is also what
prevents us from centring it completely, and the anonymity of our
body is inseparably both freedom and servitude. Thus, to sum up, the
ambiguity of being-in-the-world is translated by that of the body, and
this is understood through that of time.
We shall return later to the question of time. Let it merely be noted
for the moment that starting with this central phenomenon the relationships between the ‘psychic’ and the ‘physiological’ become conceivable. Why can the memories recalled to the one-armed man cause
the phantom arm to appear? The phantom arm is not a recollection, it
is a quasi-present and the patient feels it now, folded over his chest,
with no hint of its belonging to the past. Nor can we suppose that the
image of an arm, wandering through consciousness, has joined itself to
the stump: for then it would not be a ‘phantom’, but a renascent
perception. The phantom arm must be that same arm, lacerated by
shell splinters, its visible substance burned or rotted somewhere, which

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

appears to haunt the present body without being absorbed into it. The
imaginary arm is, then, like repressed experience, a former present
which cannot decide to recede into the past. The memories called up
before the patient induce in him a phantom limb, not as an image in
associationism summons up another image, but because any memory
reopens time lost to us and invites us to recapture the situation evoked.
Intellectual memory, in Proust’s sense, limits itself to a description of
the past, a past as idea, from which it extracts ‘characteristics’ or communicable meaning rather than discovering a structure. But it would
not be memory if the object which it constructs were not still held by a
few intentional threads to the horizon of the lived-through past, and to
that past itself as we should rediscover it if we were to delve beyond
these horizons and reopen time. In the same way, if we put back
emotion into being-in-the-world, we can understand how it can be the
origin of the phantom limb. To feel emotion is to be involved in a
situation which one is not managing to face and from which, nevertheless, one does not want to escape. Rather than admit failure or retrace
one’s steps, the subject, caught in this existential dilemma, breaks
in pieces the objective world which stands in his way and seeks symbolical satisfaction in magic acts.22 The ruin of the objective world,
abandonment of true action, ﬂight into a self-contained realm are conditions favouring the illusion of those who have lost a limb in that it
too presupposes the erasure of reality. In so far as memory and emotion can call up the phantom limb, this is not comparable to the action
of one cogitation which necessitates another cogitatio, or that of one condition bringing about its consequence. It is not that an ideal causality
here superimposes itself on a physiological one, it is that an existential
attitude motivates another and that memory, emotion and phantom
limb are equivalents in the context of being in the world.
Now why does the severing of the aﬀerent nerves banish the
phantom limb? In the perspective of being in the world this fact means
that the impulses arriving from the stump keep the amputated limb in
the circuit of existence. They establish and maintain its place, prevent it
from being abolished, and cause it still to count in the organism. They
keep empty an area which the subject’s history ﬁlls, they enable the
22

latter to build up the phantom, as structural disturbances allow the
content of psychosis to form into delirium. From our point of view, a
sensori-motor circuit is, within our comprehensive being in the world,
a relatively autonomous current of existence. Not that it always brings
to our total being a separable contribution, but because under certain
circumstances it is possible to bring to light constant responses to
stimuli which are themselves constant. The question is, therefore, how
the refusal of the deﬁciency, which is a total attitude of our existence,
needs for its expression such a highly specialized modality as a sensorimotor circuit, and why our being-in-the-world, which provides all our
reﬂexes with their meaning, and which is thus their basis, nevertheless
delivers itself over to them and is ﬁnally based upon them. Indeed, as
we have shown elsewhere, sensori-motor circuits are all the more
clearly marked as one is concerned with more integrated existences,
and the reﬂex in its pure state is to be found only in man, who has not
only a setting (Umwelt), but also a world (Welt).23
From the existential point of view, these two facts, which scientiﬁc
induction contents itself with setting side by side, are linked internally
and are understood in the light of one and the same idea. If man is not
to be embedded in the matrix of that syncretic setting in which animals
lead their lives in a sort of ek-stase, if he is to be aware of a world as the
common reason for all settings and the theatre of all patterns of
behaviour, then between himself and what elicits his action a distance
must be set, and, as Malebranche put it, forms of stimulation from
outside must henceforth impinge on him ‘respectfully’; each momentary situation must cease to be, for him, the totality of being, each
particular response must no longer ﬁll his whole ﬁeld of action. Furthermore, the elaboration of these responses, instead of occurring at
the centre of his existence, must take place on the periphery and ﬁnally
the responses themselves must no longer demand that on each occasion some special position be taken up, but they must be outlined once
and for all in their generality. Thus it is by giving up part of his
spontaneity, by becoming involved in the world through stable organs
and pre-established circuits that man can acquire the mental and practical space which will theoretically free him from his environment and
23

the body as object and mechanistic physiology

allow him to see it. And provided that even the realization of an objective world is set in the realm of existence, we shall no longer ﬁnd any
contradiction between it and bodily conditioning: it is an inner necessity for the most integrated existence to provide itself with an habitual
body. What allows us to link to each other the ‘physiological’ and the
‘psychic’, is the fact that, when reintegrated into existence, they are no
longer distinguishable respectively as the order of the in-itself, and that
of the for-itself, and that they are both directed towards an intentional
pole or towards a world. Doubtless the two histories never quite
coincide: one is commonplace and cyclic, the other may be open and
unusual, and it would be necessary to keep the term ‘history’ for the
second order of phenomena if history were a succession of events
which not only have a meaning, but furnish themselves with it. However, failing a true revolution which breaks up historical categories so
far valid, the ﬁgure in history does not create his part completely: faced
with typical situations he takes typical decisions and Nicholas II,
repeating the very words of Louis XVI, plays the already written part of
established power in face of a new power. His decisions translate the a
priori of a threatened prince as our reﬂexes translate a speciﬁc a priori.
These stereotypes, moreover, are not a destiny, and just as clothing,
jewellery and love transﬁgure the biological needs from which they
arise, in the same way within the cultural world the historical a priori is
constant only for a given phase and provided that the balance of forces
allows the same forms to remain. So history is neither a perpetual
novelty, nor a perpetual repetition, but the unique movement which
creates stable forms and breaks them up. The organism and its monotonous dialectical processes are therefore not alien to history and as it
were inassimilable to it. Man taken as a concrete being is not a psyche
joined to an organism, but the movement to and fro of existence which
at one time allows itself to take corporeal form and at others moves
towards personal acts. Psychological motives and bodily occasions may
overlap because there is not a single impulse in a living body which is
entirely fortuitous in relation to psychic intentions, not a single mental
act which has not found at least its germ or its general outline in
physiological tendencies. It is never a question of the incomprehensible
meeting of two causalities, nor of a collision between the order of
causes and that of ends. But by an imperceptible twist an organic

101

102 phenomenology of perception
process issues into human behaviour, an instinctive act changes direction and becomes a sentiment, or conversely a human act becomes
torpid and is continued absent-mindedly in the form of a reﬂex.
Between the psychic and the physiological there may take place
exchanges which almost always stand in the way of deﬁning a mental
disturbance as psychic or somatic. The disturbance described as somatic
produces, on the theme of the organic accident, tentative psychic
commentaries, and the ‘psychic’ trouble conﬁnes itself to elaborating
the human signiﬁcance of the bodily event. A patient feels a second
person implanted in his body. He is a man in half his body, a woman in
the other half. How are we to distinguish in this symptom the physiological causes and psychological motives? How are we to associate the
two explanations and how imagine any point at which the two
determinants meet? ‘In symptoms of this kind, the psychic and the
physical are so intimately linked that it is unthinkable to try to
complete one of these functional domains by the other, and that both
must be subsumed under a third . . . (We must) . . . move on from
knowledge of psychological and physiological facts to a recognition of
the animic event as a vital process inherent in our existence’.24 Thus, to
the question which we were asking, modern physiology gives a very
clear reply: the psycho-physical event can no longer be conceived
after the model of Cartesian physiology and as the juxtaposition of a
process in itself and a cogitatio. The union of soul and body is not an
amalgamation between two mutually external terms, subject and
object, brought about by arbitrary decree. It is enacted at every instant
in the movement of existence. We found existence in the body when
we approached it by the ﬁrst way of access, namely through physiology. We may therefore at this stage examine this ﬁrst result and make
it more explicit, by questioning existence this time on its own nature,
which means, by having recourse to psychology.

2
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE
BODY AND CLASSICAL
PSYCHOLOGY
In its descriptions of the body from the point of view of the self,
classical psychology was already wont to attribute to it ‘characteristics’
incompatible with the status of an object. In the ﬁrst place it was stated
that my body is distinguishable from the table or the lamp in that I can
turn away from the latter whereas my body is constantly perceived. It is
therefore an object which does not leave me. But in that case is it still an
object? If the object is an invariable structure, it is not one in spite of the
changes of perspective, but in that change or through it. It is not the case
that ever-renewed perspectives simply provide it with opportunities of
displaying its permanence, and with contingent ways of presenting
itself to us. It is an object, which means that it is standing in front of us,
only because it is observable: situated, that is to say, directly under our
hand or gaze, indivisibly overthrown and re-integrated with every
movement they make. Otherwise it would be true like an idea and not
present like a thing. It is particularly true that an object is an object only
in so far as it can be moved away from me, and ultimately disappear
from my ﬁeld of vision. Its presence is such that it entails a possible
absence. Now the permanence of my own body is entirely diﬀerent in

104 phenomenology of perception
kind: it is not at the extremity of some indeﬁnite exploration; it deﬁes
exploration and is always presented to me from the same angle. Its
permanence is not a permanence in the world, but a permanence on
my part. To say that it is always near me, always there for me, is to say
that it is never really in front of me, that I cannot array it before my
eyes, that it remains marginal to all my perceptions, that it is with me. It
is true that external objects too never turn one of their sides to me
without hiding the rest, but I can at least freely choose the side which
they are to present to me. They could not appear otherwise than in
perspective, but the particular perspective which I acquire at each
moment is the outcome of no more than physical necessity, that is to
say, of a necessity which I can use and which is not a prison for me:
from my window only the tower of the church is visible, but this
limitation simultaneously holds out the promise that from elsewhere
the whole church could be seen. It is true, moreover, that if I am a
prisoner the church will be restricted, for me, to a truncated steeple. If I
did not take oﬀ my clothes I could never see the inside of them, and it
will in fact be seen that my clothes may become appendages of my
body. But this fact does not prove that the presence of my body is to be
compared to the de facto permanence of certain objects, or the organ
compared to a tool which is always available. It shows that conversely
those actions in which I habitually engage incorporate their instruments into themselves and make them play a part in the original structure of my own body. As for the latter, it is my basic habit, the one
which conditions all the others, and by means of which they are mutually comprehensible. Its permanence near to me, its unvarying perspective are not a de facto necessity, since such necessity presupposes them:
in order that my window may impose upon me a point of view of the
church, it is necessary in the ﬁrst place that my body should impose
upon me one of the world; and the ﬁrst necessity can be merely physical only in virtue of the fact that the second is metaphysical; in short, I
am accessible to factual situations only if my nature is such that there
are factual situations for me. In other words, I observe external objects
with my body, I handle them, examine them, walk round them, but my
body itself is a thing which I do not observe: in order to be able to do
so, I should need the use of a second body which itself would be
unobservable. When I say that my body is always perceived by me,

the experience of the body and classical psychology

these words are not to be taken in a purely statistical sense, for there
must be, in the way my own body presents itself, something which
makes its absence or its variation inconceivable. What can it be? My
head is presented to my sight only to the extent of my nose end and the
boundaries of my eye-sockets. I can see my eyes in three mirrors, but
they are the eyes of someone observing, and I have the utmost difﬁculty in catching my living glance when a mirror in the street
unexpectedly reﬂects my image back at me. My body in the mirror
never stops following my intentions like their shadow, and if observation consists in varying the point of view while keeping the object
ﬁxed, then it escapes observation and is given to me as a simulacrum of
my tactile body since it imitates the body’s actions instead of responding to them by a free unfolding of perspectives. My visual body is
certainly an object as far as its parts far removed from my head are
concerned, but as we come nearer to the eyes, it becomes divorced
from objects, and reserves among them a quasi-space to which they
have no access, and when I try to ﬁll this void by recourse to the image
in the mirror, it refers me back to an original of the body which is not
out there among things, but in my own province, on this side of all
things seen. It is no diﬀerent, in spite of what may appear to be the
case, with my tactile body, for if I can, with my left hand, feel my right
hand as it touches an object, the right hand as an object is not the right
hand as it touches: the ﬁrst is a system of bones, muscles and ﬂesh
brought down at a point of space, the second shoots through space like
a rocket to reveal the external object in its place. In so far as it sees or
touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched.
What prevents its ever being an object, ever being ‘completely constituted’1 is that it is that by which there are objects. It is neither tangible
nor visible in so far as it is that which sees and touches. The body
therefore is not one more among external objects, with the peculiarity
of always being there. If it is permanent, the permanence is absolute
and is the ground for the relative permanence of disappearing objects,

106 phenomenology of perception
real objects. The presence and absence of external objects are only
variations within a ﬁeld of primordial presence, a perceptual domain
over which my body exercises power. Not only is the permanence of
my body not a particular case of the permanence of external objects in
the world, but the second cannot be understood except through the
ﬁrst: not only is the perspective of my body not a particular case of that
of objects, but furthermore the presentation of objects in perspective
cannot be understood except through the resistance of my body to all
variation of perspective. If objects may never show me more than one
of their facets, this is because I am myself in a certain place from which
I see them and which I cannot see. If nevertheless I believe in the
existence of their hidden sides and equally in a world which embraces
them all and co-exists with them, I do so in so far as my body, always
present for me, and yet involved with them in so many objective relationships, sustains their co-existence with it and communicates to
them all the pulse of its duration. Thus the permanence of one’s own
body, if only classical psychology had analysed it, might have led it to
the body no longer conceived as an object of the world, but as our
means of communication with it, to the world no longer conceived as a
collection of determinate objects, but as the horizon latent in all our
experience and itself ever-present and anterior to every determining
thought.
The other ‘characteristics’ whereby one’s own body was deﬁned
were no less interesting, and for the same reasons. My body, it was said,
is recognized by its power to give me ‘double sensations’: when I
touch my right hand with my left, my right hand, as an object, has the
strange property of being able to feel too. We have just seen that the
two hands are never simultaneously in the relationship of touched and
touching to each other. When I press my two hands together, it is not a
matter of two sensations felt together as one perceives two objects
placed side by side, but of an ambiguous set-up in which both hands
can alternate the rôles of ‘touching’ and being ‘touched’. What was
meant by talking about ‘double sensations’ is that, in passing from one
rôle to the other, I can identify the hand touched as the same one
which will in a moment be touching. In other words, in this bundle of
bones and muscles which my right hand presents to my left, I can
anticipate for an instant the integument or incarnation of that other

the experience of the body and classical psychology

right hand, alive and mobile, which I thrust towards things in order to
explore them. The body catches itself from the outside engaged in a
cognitive process; it tries to touch itself while being touched, and
initiates ‘a kind of reﬂection’2 which is suﬃcient to distinguish it from
objects, of which I can indeed say that they ‘touch’ my body, but only
when it is inert, and therefore without ever catching it unawares in its
exploratory function.
It was also said that the body is an aﬀective object, whereas external
things are from my point of view merely represented. This amounted
to stating a third time the problem of the status of my own body. For if
I say that my foot hurts, I do not simply mean that it is a cause of pain
in the same way as the nail which is cutting into it, diﬀering only in
being nearer to me; I do not mean that it is the last of the objects in the
external world, after which a more intimate kind of pain should begin,
an unlocalized awareness of pain in itself, related to the foot only by
some causal connection and within the closed system of experience. I
mean that the pain reveals itself as localized, that it is constitutive of a
‘pain-infested space’. ‘My foot hurts’ means not: ‘I think that my foot is
the cause of this pain’, but: ‘the pain comes from my foot’ or again ‘my
foot has a pain’. This is shown clearly by the ‘primitive voluminousness
of pain’ formerly spoken of by psychologists. It was therefore recognized that my body does not present itself as the objects of external
impressions do, and that perhaps even these latter objects do no more
than stand out against the aﬀective background which in the ﬁrst place
throws consciousness outside itself.
Finally when the psychologists tried to conﬁne ‘kinaesthetic sensations’ to one’s own body, arguing that these sensations present the
body’s movements to us globally, while attributing the movements of
external objects to a mediating perception and to a comparison
between successive positions, it could have been objected that movement, expressing a relationship, cannot be felt, but demands a mental
operation. This objection, however, would merely have been an
indictment of their language. What they were expressing, badly it is
true, by ‘kinaesthetic sensation’, was the originality of the movements
which I perform with my body: they directly anticipate the ﬁnal
2

Husserl, Méditations cartésiennes, p. 81.

107

108 phenomenology of perception
situation, for my intention initiates a movement through space merely
to attain the objective initially given at the starting point; there is as it
were a germ of movement which only secondarily develops into an
objective movement. I move external objects with the aid of my body,
which takes hold of them in one place and shifts them to another. But
my body itself I move directly, I do not ﬁnd it at one point of objective
space and transfer it to another, I have no need to look for it, it is
already with me—I do not need to lead it towards the movement’s
completion, it is in contact with it from the start and propels itself
towards that end. The relationships between my decision and my body
are, in movement, magic ones.
If the description of my own body given by classical psychology
already oﬀered all that is necessary to distinguish it from objects, how
does it come about that psychologists have not made this distinction or
that they have in any case seen no philosophical consequence ﬂowing
from it? The reason is that, taking a step natural to them, they chose the
position of impersonal thought to which science has been committed
as long as it believed in the possibility of separating, in observation, on
the one hand what belongs to the situation of the observer and on the
other the properties of the absolute object. For the living subject his
own body might well be diﬀerent from all external objects; the fact
remains that for the unsituated thought of the psychologist the experience of the living subject became itself an object and, far from requiring a fresh deﬁnition of being, took its place in universal being. It was
the life of the ‘psyche’ which stood in opposition to the real, but which
was treated as a second reality, as an object of scientiﬁc investigation to
be brought under a set of laws. It was postulated that our experience,
already besieged by physics and biology, was destined to be completely
absorbed into objective knowledge, with the consummation of the
system of the sciences. Thenceforth the experience of the body
degenerated into a ‘representation’ of the body; it was not a phenomenon but a fact of the psyche. In the matter of living appearance, my
visual body includes a large gap at the level of the head, but biology
was there ready to ﬁll that gap, to explain it through the structure of the
eyes, to instruct me in what the body really is, showing that I have a
retina and a brain like other men and like the corpses which I dissect,
and that, in short, the surgeon’s instrument could infallibly bring to

the experience of the body and classical psychology

light in this indeterminate zone of my head the exact replica of plates
illustrating the human anatomy. I apprehend my body as a subjectobject, as capable of ‘seeing’ and ‘suﬀering’, but these confused representations were so many psychological oddities, samples of a magical
variety of thought the laws of which are studied by psychology and
sociology and which has its place assigned to it by them, in the system
of the real world, as an object of scientiﬁc investigation. This imperfect
picture of my body, its marginal presentation, and its equivocal status
as touching and touched, could not therefore be structural characteristics
of the body itself; they did not aﬀect the idea of it; they became ‘distinctive characteristics’ of those contents of consciousness which make
up our representation of the body: these contents are consistent, aﬀective and strangely duplicated in ‘double sensations’, but apart from this
the representation of the body is a representation like any other and
correspondingly the body is an object like any other. Psychologists did
not realize that in treating the experience of the body in this way they
were simply, in accordance with the scientiﬁc approach, shelving a
problem which ultimately could not be burked. The inadequacy of my
perception was taken as a de facto inadequacy resulting from the organization of my sensory apparatus; the presence of my body was taken as
a de facto presence springing from its constant action on my receptive
nervous system; ﬁnally the union of soul and body, which was presupposed by these two explanations, was understood, in Cartesian fashion,
as a de facto union whose de jure possibility need not be established,
because the fact, as the starting point of knowledge, was eliminated
from the ﬁnal result. Now the psychologist could imitate the scientist
and, for a moment at least, see his body as others saw it, and conversely
see the bodies of others as mechanical things with no inner life. The
contribution made from the experiences of others had the eﬀect of
dimming the structure of his own, and conversely, having lost contact
with himself he became blind to the behaviour of others. He thus saw
everything from the point of view of universal thought which abolished equally his experience of others and his experience of himself.
But as a psychologist he was engaged in a task which by nature pulled
him back into himself, and he could not allow himself to remain
unaware to this extent. For whereas neither the physicist nor the chemist are the objects of their own investigation, the psychologist was

109

110 phenomenology of perception
himself, in the nature of the case, the fact which exercised him. This
representation of the body, this magical experience, which he
approached in a detached frame of mind, was himself; he lived it while
he thought about it. It is true that, as has been shown,3 it was not
enough for him to be a psyche in order to know this, for this knowledge, like other knowledge, is acquired only through our relations
with other people. It does not emerge from any recourse to an ideal of
introspective psychology, and between himself and others no less than
between himself and himself, the psychologist was able and obliged to
rediscover a pre-objective relationship. But as a psyche speaking of the
psyche, he was all that he was talking about. This history of the psyche
which he was elaborating in adopting the objective attitude was one
whose outcome he already possessed within himself, or rather he was,
in his existence, its contracted outcome and latent memory. The union
of soul and body had not been brought about once and for all in a
remote realm; it came into being afresh at every moment beneath the
psychologist’s thinking, not as a repetitive event which each time takes
the psyche by surprise, but as a necessity that the psychologist knew to
be in the depths of his being as he became aware of it as a piece of
knowledge. The birth of perception from ‘sensory givens’ to ‘world’
had to be renewed with each act of perception, otherwise the sensory
givens would have lost the meaning they owed to this development.
Hence the ‘psyche’ was not an object like others; it had done everything that one was about to say of it before it could be said; the
psychologist’s being knew more about itself than he did; nothing that
had happened or was happening according to science was completely
alien to it. Applied to the psyche, the notion of fact, therefore, underwent a transformation. The de facto psyche, with its ‘peculiarities’, was
no longer an event in objective time and in the external world, but an
event with which we were in internal contact, of which we were
ourselves the ceaseless accomplishment or upsurge, and which continually gathered within itself its past, its body and its world. Before
being an objective fact, the union of soul and body had to be, then, a
possibility of consciousness itself and the question arose as to what the
perceiving subject is if he is to be able to experience a body as his own.

the experience of the body and classical psychology

There was no longer a fact passively submitted to, but one assumed. To
be a consciousness or rather to be an experience is to hold inner communication with the world, the body and other people, to be with them
instead of being beside them. To concern oneself with psychology is
necessarily to encounter, beneath objective thought which moves
among ready-made things, a ﬁrst opening upon things without which
there would be no objective knowledge. The psychologist could not
fail to rediscover himself as experience, which means as an immediate
presence to the past, to the world, to the body and to others at the very
moment when he was trying to see himself as an object among objects.
Let us then return to the ‘characteristics’ of one’s own body and
resume the study of it where we left oﬀ. By doing so we shall trace the
progress of modern psychology and thereby eﬀect along with it the
return to experience.

3
THE SPATIALITY OF ONE’S
OWN BODY AND MOTILITY
Let us ﬁrst of all describe the spatiality of my own body. If my arm is
resting on the table I should never think of saying that it is beside the ashtray in the way in which the ash-tray is beside the telephone. The
outline of my body is a frontier which ordinary spatial relations do not
cross. This is because its parts are inter-related in a peculiar way: they
are not spread out side by side, but enveloped in each other. For
example, my hand is not a collection of points. In cases of allocheiria,*
in which the subject feels in his right hand stimuli applied to his left
hand, it is impossible to suppose that each of the stimulations changes
its spatial value on its own account.1 The various points on the left
hand are transferred to the right as relevant to a total organ, a hand
without parts which has been suddenly displaced. Hence they form a
system and the space of my hand is not a mosaic of spatial values.
Similarly my whole body for me is not an assemblage of organs
juxtaposed in space. I am in undivided possession of it and I know
* A disorder of sensation in which sensations are referred to the wrong part of the body
(Translator’s note). Cf. for example Head, On disturbances of sensation with especial reference to the
pain of visceral disease.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

where each of my limbs is through a body image in which all are
included. But the notion of body image is ambiguous, as are all notions
which make their appearance at turning points in scientiﬁc advance.
They can be fully developed only through a reform of methods. At ﬁrst,
therefore, they are used only in a sense which falls short of their full
sense, and it is their immanent development which bursts the bounds
of methods hitherto used. ‘Body image’ was at ﬁrst understood to
mean a compendium of our bodily experience, capable of giving a commentary and meaning to the internal impressions and the impression
of possessing a body at any moment. It was supposed to register for me
the positional changes of the parts of my body for each movement of
one of them, the position of each local stimulus in the body as a whole,
an account of the movements performed at every instant during a
complex gesture, in short a continual translation into visual language
of the kinaesthetic and articular impressions of the moment. When the
term body image was ﬁrst used, it was thought that nothing more was
being introduced than a convenient name for a great many associations
of images, and it was intended merely to convey the fact that these
associations were ﬁrmly established and constantly ready to come into
play. The body image was supposed gradually to show itself through
childhood in proportion as the tactile, kinaesthetic and articular contents were associated among themselves or with visual contents, and
more easily evoked them.2 Its physiological representation could then
be no more than a focus of images in the classical sense. Yet in the use
made of it by psychologists, it is clear that the body image does not ﬁt
into this associationist deﬁnition. For example, in order that the body
image may elucidate allocheiria, it is not enough that each sensation of
the left hand should take its place among generic images of all parts of
the body acting in association to form around the left hand, as it were,
a superimposed sketch of the body; these associations must be constantly subject to a unique law, the spatiality of the body must work
downwards from the whole to the parts, the left hand and its position
must be implied in a comprehensive bodily purpose and must originate

in that purpose, so that it may at one stroke not only be superimposed
on or cleave to the right hand, but actually become the right hand.
When we try3 to elucidate the phenomenon of the phantom limb by
relating it to the body image of the subject, we add to the accepted
explanations, in terms of cerebral tracks and recurrent sensations, only
if the body image, instead of being the residue of habitual cenesthesis,
becomes the law of its constitution. If a need was felt to introduce this
new word, it was in order to make it clear that the spatial and temporal
unity, the inter-sensory or the sensori-motor unity of the body is, so to
speak, de jure, that it is not conﬁned to contents actually and fortuitously
associated in the course of our experience, that it is in some way
anterior to them and makes their association possible. We are therefore
feeling our way towards a second deﬁnition of the body image: it is no
longer seen as the straightforward result of associations established
during experience, but a total awareness of my posture in the intersensory world, a ‘form’ in the sense used by Gestalt psychology.4 But
already this second deﬁnition too is superseded by the analyses of the
psychologists. It is inadequate to say that my body is a form, that is to
say a phenomenon in which the totality takes precedence over the
parts. How is such a phenomenon possible? Because a form, compared
to the mosaic of a physico-chemical body or to that of ‘cenesthesis’, is
a new type of existence. The fact that the paralysed limb of the anosognosic no longer counts in the subject’s body image, is accounted for by
the body image’s being neither the mere copy nor even the global
awareness of the existing parts of the body, and by its active integration
of these latter only in proportion to their value to the organism’s
projects. Psychologists often say that the body image is dynamic.5
Brought down to a precise sense, this term means that my body appears
to me as an attitude directed towards a certain existing or possible task.
And indeed its spatiality is not, like that of external objects or like that

of ‘spatial sensations’, a spatiality of position, but a spatiality of situation. If I
stand in front of my desk and lean on it with both hands, only my
hands are stressed and the whole of my body trails behind them like
the tail of a comet. It is not that I am unaware of the whereabouts of my
shoulders or back, but these are simply swallowed up in the position of
my hands, and my whole posture can be read so to speak in the pressure they exert on the table. If I stand holding my pipe in my closed
hand, the position of my hand is not determined discursively by the
angle which it makes with my forearm, and my forearm with my
upper arm, and my upper arm with my trunk, and my trunk with the
ground. I know indubitably where my pipe is, and thereby I know
where my hand and my body are, as primitive man in the desert is
always able to take his bearings immediately without having to cast his
mind back, and add up distances covered and deviations made since
setting oﬀ. The word ‘here’ applied to my body does not refer to a
determinate position in relation to other positions or to external coordinates, but the laying down of the ﬁrst co-ordinates, the anchoring
of the active body in an object, the situation of the body in face of its
tasks. Bodily space can be distinguished from external space and
envelop its parts instead of spreading them out, because it is the darkness needed in the theatre to show up the performance, the background of somnolence or reserve of vague power against which the
gesture and its aim6 stand out, the zone of not being in front of which
precise beings, ﬁgures and points can come to light. In the last analysis,
if my body can be a ‘form’ and if there can be, in front of it, important
ﬁgures against indiﬀerent backgrounds, this occurs in virtue of its
being polarized by its tasks, of its existence towards them, of its collecting
together of itself in its pursuit of its aims; the body image is ﬁnally a
way of stating that my body is in-the-world.7 As far as spatiality is
concerned, and this alone interests us at the moment, one’s own body
is the third term, always tacitly understood, in the ﬁgure-background
structure, and every ﬁgure stands out against the double horizon of
external and bodily space. One must therefore reject as an abstraction
6

Grünbaum, Asphasie und Motorik, p. 395.
We have already seen (cf. supra pp. 81–2) that the phantom limb, which is a modality of
the body image, is understood in terms of the general movement of being-in-the-world.

115

116 phenomenology of perception
any analysis of bodily space which takes account only of ﬁgures and
points, since these can neither be conceived nor be without horizons.
It will perhaps be replied that the ﬁgure-background structure or the
point-horizon structure themselves presuppose the notion of objective
space; that in order to experience a display of dexterity as a ﬁgure against
the massive background of the body, the hand and the rest of the body
must be linked by this relationship of objective spatiality, so that the
ﬁgure-background structure becomes once again one of the contingent
contents of the universal form of space. But what meaning could the
word ‘against’ have for a subject not placed by his body face to face
with the world? It implies the distinction of a top and a bottom, or an
‘orientated space’.8 When I say that an object is on a table, I always
mentally put myself either in the table or in the object, and I apply to
them a category which theoretically ﬁts the relationship of my body to
external objects. Stripped of this anthropological association, the word
on is indistinguishable from the word ‘under’ or the word ‘beside’.
Even if the universal form of space is that without which there would
be for us no bodily space, it is not that by which there is one. Even if
the form is not the setting in which, but the means whereby the content is
posited, it is not the suﬃcient means of this act of positing as far as
bodily space is concerned, and to this extent the bodily content
remains, in relation to it, something opaque, fortuitous and unintelligible. The only solution along this road would be to acknowledge that
the body’s spatiality has no meaning of its own to distinguish it from
objective spatiality, which would do away with the content as a phenomenon and hence with the problem of its relation to form. But can
we pretend to discover no distinctive meaning in the words ‘on’,
‘under’, ‘beside’, or in the dimensions of orientated space? Even if
analysis discovers in all these relationships the universal relation of
externality, the self-evidentness of top and bottom, right and left, for
the person who has his being in space, prevents us from treating all
these distinctions as nonsense, and suggests to us that we should look
beneath the explicit meaning of deﬁnitions for the latent meaning of
experiences. The relationships between the two spaces would therefore
8

Cf. Becker, Beiträge zur phänomenologischen Begründung der Geometrie und ihren physikalischen
Anwendungen.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

be as follows: as soon as I try to posit bodily space or bring out its
meaning I ﬁnd nothing in it but intelligible space. But at the same time
this intelligible space is not extracted from orientated space, it is merely
its explicit expression, and, when separated from that root has no
meaning whatsoever. The truth is that homogeneous space can convey
the meaning of orientated space only because it is from the latter that it
has received that meaning. In so far as the content can be really subsumed under the form and can appear as the content of that form, it is
because the form is accessible only through the content. Bodily space
can really become a fragment of objective space only if within its
individuality as bodily space it contains the dialectical ferment to transform it into universal space. This is what we have tried to express by
saying that the point-horizon structure is the foundation of space. The
horizon or background would not extend beyond the ﬁgure or round
about it, unless they partook of the same kind of being as the ﬁgure,
and unless they could be converted into points by a transference of the
gaze. But the point-horizon structure can teach me what a point is only
in virtue of the maintenance of a hither zone of corporeality from
which to be seen, and round about it indeterminate horizons which
are the counterpart of this seeing. The multiplicity of points or ‘heres’
can in the nature of things be constituted only by a chain of experiences in which on each occasion one and no more of them is presented
as an object, and which is itself built up in the heart of this space. And
ﬁnally, far from my body’s being for me no more than a fragment of
space, there would be no space at all for me if I had no body.
If bodily space and external space form a practical system, the ﬁrst
being the background against which the object as the goal of our
action may stand out or the void in front of which it may come to light, it
is clearly in action that the spatiality of our body is brought into being,
and an analysis of one’s own movement should enable us to arrive at a
better understanding of it. By considering the body in movement, we
can see better how it inhabits space (and, moreover, time) because
movement is not limited to submitting passively to space and time, it
actively assumes them, it takes them up in their basic signiﬁcance
which is obscured in the commonplaceness of established situations.
We should like to analyses closely an example of morbid motility which
clearly shows the fundamental relations between the body and space.

117

118 phenomenology of perception
A patient9 whom traditional psychiatry would class among cases of
psychic blindness is unable to perform ‘abstract’ movements with his
eyes shut; movements, that is, which are not relevant to any actual
situation, such as moving arms and legs to order, or bending and
straightening a ﬁnger. Nor can he describe the position of his body or
even his head, or the passive movements of his limbs. Finally, when his
head, arm or leg is touched, he cannot identify the point on his body;
he cannot distinguish two points of contact on his skin even as much as
three inches apart; and he cannot recognize the size or shape of objects
placed against his body. He manages the abstract movements only if he
is allowed to watch the limb required to perform them, or to go
through preparatory movements involving the whole body. The localization of stimuli, and recognition of objects by touch also become
possible with the aid of the preparatory movements. Even when his
eyes are closed, the patient performs with extraordinary speed and
precision the movements needed in living his life, provided that he is
in the habit of performing them: he takes his handkerchief from his
pocket and blows his nose, takes a match out of a box and lights a lamp.
He is employed in the manufacture of wallets and his production rate is
equal to three quarters of that of a normal workman. He can even10
without any preparatory movement, perform these ‘concrete’ movements to order. In the same patient, and also in cerebellar cases, one
notices11 a dissociation of the act of pointing from reactions of taking
or grasping: the same subject who is unable to point to order to a part
of his body, quickly moves his hand to the point where a mosquito is
stinging him. Concrete movements and acts of grasping therefore
enjoy a privileged position for which we need to ﬁnd some
explanation.
Let us examine the question more closely. A patient, asked to point
to some part of his body, his nose for example, can only manage to do
so if he is allowed to take hold of it. If the patient is set the task of

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

interrupting the movement before its completion, or if he is allowed to
touch his nose only with a wooden ruler, the action becomes impossible.12 It must therefore be concluded that ‘grasping’ or ‘touching’,
even for the body, is diﬀerent from ‘pointing’. From the outset the
grasping movement is magically at its completion; it can begin only by
anticipating its end, since to disallow taking hold is suﬃcient to inhibit
the action. And it has to be admitted that a point on my body can be
present to me as one to be taken hold of without being given in this
anticipated grasp as a point to be indicated. But how is this possible? If I
know where my nose is when it is a question of holding it, how can I
not know where it is when it is a matter of pointing to it? It is probably
because knowledge of where something is can be understood in a
number of ways. Traditional psychology has no concept to cover these
varieties of consciousness of place because consciousness of place is
always, for such psychology, a positional consciousness, a representation, Vor-stellung, because as such it gives us the place as a determination
of the objective world and because such a representation either is or is
not, but, if it is, yields the object to us quite unambiguously and as an
end identiﬁable through all its appearances. Now here, on the other
hand, we have to create the concepts necessary to convey the fact that
bodily space may be given to me in an intention to take hold without
being given in an intention to know. The patient is conscious of his
bodily space as the matrix of his habitual action, but not as an objective
setting; his body is at his disposal as a means of ingress into a familiar
surrounding, but not as the means of expression of a gratuitous and
free spatial thought. When ordered to perform a concrete movement,
he ﬁrst of all repeats the order in a questioning tone of voice, then his
body assumes the general position required for the task; ﬁnally he goes
through the movement. It is noticeable that the whole body is involved
in it, and that the patient never cuts it down, as a normal subject would,
to the strict minimum. To the military salute are added the other
external marks of respect. To the right hand pantomime of combing
the hair is added, with the left, that of holding a mirror; when the right
hand pretends to knock in a nail, the left pretends to hold the nail. The
explanation is that the order is taken quite seriously and that the patient
12

Ibid. This is a cerebellar case.

119

120 phenomenology of perception
manages to perform these concrete movements to order only provided
that he places himself mentally in the actual situation to which they
correspond. The normal subject, on giving, to order, a military salute,
sees in it no more than an experimental situation, and therefore
restricts the movement to its most important elements and does not
throw himself into it.13 He is using his body as a means to play acting;
he ﬁnds it entertaining to pretend to be a soldier; he escapes from
reality in the rôle of the soldier14 just as the actor slips his real body into
the ‘great phantom’15 of the character to be played. The normal man
and the actor do not mistake imaginary situations for reality, but extricate their real bodies from the living situation to make them breathe,
speak and, if need be, weep in the realm of imagination. This is what
our patient is no longer able to do. In the course of living, he says ‘I
experience the movements as being a result of the situation, of the
sequence of events themselves; myself and my movements are, so to
speak, merely a link in the whole process and I am scarcely aware of
any voluntary initiative . . . It all happens independently of me.’ In the
same way, in order to make a movement to order he places himself ‘in
the aﬀective situation as a whole, and it is from this that the movement
ﬂows, as in real life’.16 If his performance is interrupted and he has the
experimental situation recalled to him, all his dexterity disappears.
Once more kinetic initiative becomes impossible, the patient must ﬁrst
of all ‘ﬁnd’ his arm, ‘ﬁnd’, by the preparatory movements, the gesture
called for, and the gesture itself loses the melodic character which it
presents in ordinary life, and becomes manifestly a collection of partial
movements strung laboriously together. I can therefore take my place,
through the medium of my body as the potential source of a certain
number of familiar actions, in my environment conceived as a set of
manipulanda and without, moreover, envisaging my body or my surrounding as objects in the Kantian sense, that is, as systems of qualities
linked by some intelligible law, as transparent entities, free from any
attachment to a speciﬁc place or time, and ready to be named or at least

pointed out. There is my arm seen as sustaining familiar acts, my body
as giving rise to determinate action having a ﬁeld or scope known to
me in advance, there are my surroundings as a collection of possible
points upon which this bodily action may operate,—and there is, furthermore, my arm as a mechanism of muscles and bones, as a contrivance for bending and stretching, as an articulated object, the world as a
pure spectacle into which I am not absorbed, but which I contemplate
and point out. As far as bodily space is concerned, it is clear that there is
a knowledge of place which is reducible to a sort of co-existence with
that place, and which is not simply nothing, even though it cannot be
conveyed by a description or even by the mute reference of a gesture. A
patient of the kind discussed above, when stung by a mosquito, does
not need to look for the place where he has been stung. He ﬁnds it
straight away, because for him there is no question of locating it in
relation to axes of co-ordinates in objective space, but of reaching with
his phenomenal hand a certain painful spot on his phenomenal body,
and because between the hand as a scratching potentiality and the place
stung as a spot to be scratched a directly experienced relationship
is presented in the natural system of one’s own body. The whole
operation takes place in the domain of the phenomenal; it does not
run through the objective world, and only the spectator, who lends his
objective representation of the living body to the acting subject, can
believe that the sting is perceived, that the hand moves in objective
space, and consequently ﬁnd it odd that the same subject should fail in
experiments requiring him to point things out. Similarly the subject,
when put in front of his scissors, needle and familiar tasks, does not
need to look for his hands or his ﬁngers, because they are not objects to
be discovered in objective space: bones, muscles and nerves, but potentialities already mobilized by the perception of scissors or needle, the
central end of those ‘intentional threads’ which link him to the objects
given. It is never our objective body that we move, but our phenomenal
body, and there is no mystery in that, since our body, as the potentiality of this or that part of the world, surges towards objects to be
grasped and perceives them.17 In the same way the patient has no need
17

It is not a question of how the soul acts on the objective body, since it is not on the
latter that it acts, but on the phenomenal body. So the question has to be reframed, and

121

122 phenomenology of perception
to look for a theatre of action and a space in which to deploy these
concrete movements: the space is given to him in the form of the world
at this moment; it is the piece of leather ‘to be cut up’; it is the lining
‘to be sewn’. The bench, scissors, pieces of leather oﬀer themselves to
the subject as poles of action; through their combined values they
delimit a certain situation, an open situation moreover, which calls for
a certain mode of resolution, a certain kind of work. The body is no
more than an element in the system of the subject and his world, and
the task to be performed elicits the necessary movements from him by
a sort of remote attraction, as the phenomenal forces at work in my
visual ﬁeld elicit from me, without any calculation on my part, the
motor reactions which establish the most eﬀective balance between
them, or as the conventions of our social group, or our set of listeners,
immediately elicit from us the words, attitudes and tone which are
ﬁtting. Not that we are trying to conceal our thoughts or to please
others, but because we are literally what others think of us and what
our world is. In the concrete movement the patient has a positing
awareness neither of the stimulus nor of his reaction: quite simply he is
his body and his body is the potentiality of a certain world.
What, on the other hand, happens in experiments in which the
patient fails? If a part of his body is touched and he is asked to locate
the point of contact, he ﬁrst of all sets his whole body in motion and
thus narrows down the problem of location, then he comes still nearer
by moving the limb in question, and the process is completed in the
form of quiverings of the skin in the neighbourhood of the point
touched.18 If the subject’s arm is extended horizontally, he cannot
describe its position until he has performed a set of pendular movements which convey to him the arm position in relation to the trunk,
that of the forearm to the rest of the arm, and that of the trunk in
we must ask why there are two views of me and of my body: my body for me and my
body for others, and how these two systems can exist together. It is indeed not enough to
say that the objective body belongs to the realm of ‘for others’, and my phenomenal body
to that of ‘for me’, and we cannot refuse to pose the problem of their relations, since the
‘for me’ and the ‘for others’ co-exist in one and the same world, as is proved by my
perception of an other who immediately brings me back to the condition of an object for
him.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

relation to the vertical. In the case of passive movement, the subject
feels that there is movement but cannot say of what kind and in what
direction. Here again he resorts to active movements. The patient concludes that he is lying down from the pressure of the mattress on his
back, or that he is standing from the pressure of the ground on his
feet.19 If the two points of a compass are placed on his hand, he can
distinguish them only if he is allowed to rotate his hand, and bring ﬁrst
one and then the other point into contact with his skin. If letters or
ﬁgures are traced out on his hand, he identiﬁes them only provided
that he can himself move his hand, and it is not the movement of the
point on his hand which he perceives, but conversely the movement of
his hand in relation to the point. This is proved by tracing on his left
hand normal letters, which are never recognized, then the mirrored
image of the same letters, which is immediately understood. The mere
touching of a paper rectangle or oval gives rise to no recognition,
whereas the subject recognizes the ﬁgures if he is allowed to make
exploratory movements to ‘spell out’ the shapes, to spot their ‘characteristics’ and to identify the object on this basis.20 How are we to coordinate this set of facts and how are we to discover by means of it
what function, found in the normal person, is absent in the patient?
There can be no question of simply transferring to the normal person
what the deﬁcient one lacks and is trying to recover. Illness, like childhood and ‘primitive’ mentality, is a complete form of existence and the
procedures which it employs to replace normal functions which have
been destroyed are equally pathological phenomena. It is impossible to
deduce the normal from the pathological, deﬁciencies from the substitute functions, by a mere change of the sign. We must take substitutions as substitutions, as allusions to some fundamental function that
they are striving to make good, and the direct image of which they fail
to furnish. The genuine inductive method is not a ‘diﬀerential
method’; it consists in correctly reading phenomena, in grasping their
19

For example, the subject runs his ﬁngers over an angle several times: ‘My ﬁngers,’ he
says, ‘move straight along, then stop, and then move oﬀ again in another direction: it is
an angle, it must be a right angle.’—‘Two, three, four angles, the sides are each two
centimetres long, so they are equal, all the angles are right angles . . . It’s a dice.’ Ibid.,
p. 195. Cf. pp. 187–206.
20

123

124 phenomenology of perception
meaning, that is, in treating them as modalities and variations of the
subject’s total being. We observe that when the patient is questioned
about the position of his limbs or of a tactile stimulus, he tries, by
means of preparatory movements, to make his body into an object of
present perception. Asked about the shape of an object in contact with
his body, he tries to trace it out himself by following the outline of the
object. Nothing would be more misleading than to suppose the normal
person adopting similar procedures, diﬀering merely in being shortened by constant use. The kind of patient under consideration sets out
in search of these explicit perceptions only in order to provide a substitute for a certain mutual presence of body and object which is a datum
of normal experience and which we still have to reconstitute. It is true
that even in the normal person the perception of the body and of
objects in contact with the body is vague when there is no movement.21
The fact remains that the normal person can, in the absence of any
movements, always distinguish a stimulus applied to his head from one
applied to his body. Are we to suppose that22 excitations felt as coming
either from outside or from one’s own body have brought into play, in
that person, ‘kinaesthetic residua’ which take the place of actual
movements? But then how could data supplied by the sense of touch
arouse ‘kinaesthetic residua’ of a determinate kind unless they carried
within themselves some characteristic which enables them to do so,
unless they themselves, in other words, had some well deﬁned or
obscure spatial signiﬁcance?23 At least we can say that the normal subject can immediately ‘come to grips’ with his body.24 He enjoys the use
of his body not only in so far as it is involved in a concrete setting, he is
in a situation not only in relation to the tasks imposed by a particular
job, he is not open merely to real situations; for, over and above all this,
his body is correlated with pure stimuli devoid of any practical bearing;
he is open to those verbal and imaginary situations which he can
choose for himself or which may be suggested to him in the course of
an experiment. His body, when touched, is not presented to him as a

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

geometrical outline in which each stimulus occupies an explicit position, and Schneider’s disease lies precisely in his need, in order to ﬁnd
out where he is being touched, to convert the bodily area touched into
a shape. But each stimulus applied to the body of the normal person
arouses a kind of ‘potential movement’, rather than an actual one; the
part of the body in question sheds its anonymity, is revealed, by the
presence of a particular tension, as a certain power of action within
the framework of the anatomical apparatus. In the case of the normal
subject, the body is available not only in real situations into which it is
drawn. It can turn aside from the world, apply its activity to stimuli
which aﬀect its sensory surfaces, lend itself to experimentation, and
generally speaking take its place in the realm of the potential. It is
because of its conﬁnement within the actual that an unsound sense of
touch calls for special movements designed to localize stimuli, and for
the same reason the patient substitutes, for tactile recognition and perception, a laborious decoding of stimuli and deduction of objects. For a
key, for instance, to appear as such in my tactile experience, a kind of
fulness of touch is required, a tactile ﬁeld in which local impressions
may be co-ordinated into a shape just as notes are mere stepping-stones
in a melody; and that very viscosity of tactile data which makes the
body dependent upon actual situations reduces the object to a collection of successive ‘characteristics’, perception to an abstract account,
recognition to a rational synthesis or a plausible conjecture, and strips
the object of its carnal presence and facticity. Whereas in the normal
person every event related to movement or sense of touch causes consciousness to put up a host of intentions which run from the body as
the centre of potential action either towards the body itself or towards
the object, in the case of the patient, on the other hand, the tactile
impression remains opaque and sealed up. It may well draw the grasping hand towards itself, but does not stand in front of the hand in the
manner of a thing which can be pointed out. The normal person reckons
with the possible, which thus, without shifting from its position as a
possibility, acquires a sort of actuality. In the patient’s case, however,
the ﬁeld of actuality is limited to what is met with in the shape of a real
contact or is related to these data by some explicit process of
deduction.
The analysis of ‘abstract movement’ in patients throws into relief this

125

126 phenomenology of perception
possession of space, this spatial existence which is the primary condition of all living perception. If the patient is ordered to shut his eyes
and then perform an abstract movement, a set of preparatory operations is called for in order to enable him to ‘ﬁnd’ the operative limb,
the direction or pace of the movement, and ﬁnally the plane in which it
is to be executed. If, for instance, he is ordered to move his arm, with
no detail as to how, he is ﬁrst of all perplexed. Then he moves his whole
body and after a time his movements are conﬁned to his arm, which
the subject eventually ‘ﬁnds’. If it is a question of ‘raising his arm’ the
patient must also ‘ﬁnd’ his head (which symbolizes ‘up’ for him) by
means of a set of pendulum movements which are continued throughout the action and which serve to establish the objective. If the subject
is asked to trace a square or a circle in the air, he ﬁrst ‘ﬁnds’ his arm,
then lifts it in front of him as a normal subject would do to ﬁnd a wall
in the dark and ﬁnally he makes a few rough movements in a straight
line or describing various curves, and if one of these happens to be
circular he promptly completes the circle. Moreover he can ﬁnd the
requisite movement only in a certain plane, which is not quite perpendicular to the ground, and apart from this special plane he cannot
begin to trace the ﬁgures.25 Clearly the patient ﬁnds in his body only an
amorphous mass into which actual movement alone introduces divisions and links. In looking to his body to perform the movement for
him he is like a speaker who cannot utter a word without following a
text written beforehand. The patient himself neither seeks nor ﬁnds his
movement, but moves his body about until the movement comes. The
order given is not meaningless to him, since he recognizes the
inadequacy of his ﬁrst attempts, and also since, if a fortuitous gesture
produces the required movement, he is aware of it and can immediately turn his piece of good fortune to account. But if the order has an
intellectual signiﬁcance for him and not a motor one, it does not communicate anything to him as a mobile subject; he may well ﬁnd in the shape
of a movement performed an illustration of the order given, but he can
never convert the thought of a movement into actual movement. What
he lacks is neither motility nor thought, and we are brought to the
recognition of something between movement as a third person process
25

Goldstein, Über den Einﬂuss . . . , pp. 213–22.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

and thought as a representation of movement—something which is an
anticipation of, or arrival at, the objective and is ensured by the body
itself as a motor power, a ‘motor project’ (Bewegungsentwurf), a ‘motor
intentionality’ in the absence of which the order remains a dead letter.
The patient either conceives the ideal formula for the movement, or
else he launches his body into blind attempts to perform it, whereas for
the normal person every movement is, indissolubly, movement and
consciousness of movement. This can be expressed by saying that for
the normal person every movement has a background, and that the
movement and its background are ‘moments of a unique totality’.26
The background to the movement is not a representation associated or
linked externally with the movement itself, but is immanent in the
movement inspiring and sustaining it at every moment. The plunge
into action is, from the subject’s point of view, an original way of
relating himself to the object, and is on the same footing as perception.
Light is thus thrown upon the distinction between abstract and concrete movement: the background to concrete movement is the world as
given, whereas the background to abstract movement is built up. When
I motion my friend to come nearer, my intention is not a thought
prepared within me and I do not perceive the signal in my body. I
beckon across the world, I beckon over there, where my friend is; the
distance between us, his consent or refusal are immediately read in my
gesture; there is not a perception followed by a movement, for both
form a system which varies as a whole. If, for example, realizing that I
am not going to be obeyed, I vary my gesture, we have here, not two
distinct acts of consciousness. What happens is that I see my partner’s
unwillingness, and my gesture of impatience emerges from this situation without any intervening thought.27 If I then execute ‘the same’
movement, but without having any present or even imaginary partner
in mind, and treat it as ‘a set of movements in themselves’;28 if, that is, I
perform a ‘ﬂexion’ of the forearm in relation to the upper arm, with
‘supination’ of the arm and ‘ﬂexion’ of the ﬁngers, my body, which a

moment ago was the vehicle of the movement, now becomes its end;
its motor project is no longer directed towards someone in the world,
but towards my fore and upper arm, and my ﬁngers; and it is directed
towards them, furthermore, in so far as they are capable of breaking
with their involvement in the given world and giving shape round
about me to an imaginary situation, or even in so far as, independently
of any ﬁctitious partner, I look with curiosity upon this strange signifying contrivance and set it to work for my amusement.29 The abstract
movement carves out within that plenum of the world in which concrete movement took place a zone of reﬂection and subjectivity; it
superimposes upon physical space a virtual or human space. Concrete
movement is therefore centripetal whereas abstract movement is centrifugal. The former occurs in the realm of being or of the actual, the
latter on the other hand in that of the virtual or the non-existent; the
ﬁrst adheres to a given background, the second throws out its own
background. The normal function which makes abstract movement
possible is one of ‘projection’ whereby the subject of movement keeps
in front of him an area of free space in which what does not naturally
exist may take on a semblance of existence. One knows of patients with
powers less seriously aﬀected than Schneider’s who perceive forms,
distances and objects in themselves, but who are unable either to trace
in objects the directions which are useful from the point of view of
action, or to arrange them according to some given principle, or generally to assign to the spatial scene delimitations in human terms which
make it the ﬁeld of our action. For instance, patients faced with a dead
end in a labyrinth have diﬃculty in ﬁnding ‘the opposite direction’. If a
ruler is laid between them and the doctor they cannot, to order, distribute the objects between ‘their side’ and ‘the doctor’s side’. They are
very inaccurate in pointing out, on another person’s arm, the point
corresponding to the one stimulated on their own. Knowing that the
month is March and the day a Monday, they will have diﬃculty in
saying what the previous month and day were, though they may well
Goldstein (Über die Abhängigkeit . . . , pp. 160 and ﬀ.) merely says that the background of
abstract movement is the body, and this is true in that the body during abstract movement is no longer merely the vehicle, but becomes the aim of the movement. Nevertheless, by changing function, it also changes its existential modality and passes from the
actual to the possible.

know by heart the days and months in their correct order. They are
incapable of comparing the number of units contained in two sets of
sticks placed in front of them: they may count the same stick twice
over, or else include in one set of sticks some which belong to the
other.30 The reason is that all these operations require the same ability
to mark out boundaries and directions in the given world, to establish
lines of force, to keep perspectives in view, in a world, to organize the
given world in accordance with the projects of the present moment, to
build into the geographical setting a behavioural one, a system of
meanings outwardly expressive of the subject’s internal activity. For
these patients the world exists only as one readymade or congealed,
whereas for the normal person his projects polarize the world, bringing magically to view a host of signs which guide action, as notices in a
museum guide the visitor. This function of ‘projection’ or ‘summoning’ (in the sense in which the medium summons an absent person
and causes him to appear) is also what makes abstract movement possible: for, in order to be in possession of my body independently of any
urgent task to be performed; in order to enjoy the use of it as the mood
takes me, in order to describe in the air a movement formulated only
verbally or in terms of moral requirements. I must reverse the natural
relationship in which the body stands to its environment, and a human
productive power must reveal itself through the density of being.
It is in these terms that the disorder discernible in the movements in
question may be described. But it may be thought that this description
(and this criticism has often been made of psychoanalysis)31 presents
to us only the signiﬁcance or essence of the disease and not its cause.
Science, it may be objected, waits upon explanation, which means
looking beneath phenomena for the circumstances upon which they

depend, in accordance with the tried methods of induction. Here, for
example, we know that the motor disorders of Schneider are related to
far-reaching disorders of sight, which in turn arise from the occipital
injury which lies at the root of his condition. Schneider does not
recognize any object by merely looking at it.32 His visual data are
almost-amorphous patches.33 As for objects not in sight, he is unable to
form any visual image of them.34 It is known, on the other hand, that
‘abstract’ movements become possible for the subject provided that he
keeps his eyes ﬁxed on the limb which is to perform them.35 Thus the
remnant of volitional motility is aided by what remains of visual knowledge. The famous methods of Mill might allow us to conclude here
that abstract movements and Zeigen are dependent on the power of
visual representation, whereas concrete movements, which are preserved by the patient as are those imitative movements, whereby he
compensates for his paucity of visual data, arise from the kinaesthetic
or tactile sense, which incidentally was remarkably exploited by
Schneider. It would appear, then, that the distinction between concrete
and abstract movement, like that between Greifen and Zeigen, is reducible
to the traditional distinction between tactile and visual, and the function of projection or evocation, which we brought to light above, to
perception and visual representation.36

‘The patient’s visual data lack any speciﬁc and characteristic structure. His impressions,
unlike those of a normal person’s, have no ﬁrm conﬁguration; they have not, for
instance, the typical look of a “square”, a “triangle”, a “straight line” or a “curve”. Before
him he sees only patches in which his sight allows him to pick out only salient characteristics, such as height and breadth and their relation to each other’. (Ibid., p. 77.) A
gardener sweeping a path ﬁfty yards away is ‘a long streak with something moving
backwards and forwards towards the top of it’ (p. 108). In the street the patient distinguishes men from vehicles by the fact that ‘men are all the same; long and thin—
vehicles are wide, unmistakeably so, and much thicker’ (ibid.).

In reality, an inductive analysis carried out according to Mill’s
methods is fruitless. For the disturbances of abstract movement and
Zeigen are encountered not only in cases of psychological blindness, but
also in cerebellar patients and in many other disorders.37 There is no
justiﬁcation for picking out as crucial just one of these concordances
and using it to ‘explain’ the act of pointing out. In face of the ambiguity of facts one must abandon the mere statistical noting-down of
coincidences, and try to ‘understand’ the relation which they reveal. In
cerebellar cases it is observed that visual as distinct from auditory stimuli produce only imperfect motor reactions, and yet there is with them
no reason to presume any primary disturbance of the visual function. It
is not because the latter is deﬁcient that designatory movements
become impossible, but, on the contrary, because the attitude of Zeigen
is impossible that the visual stimuli arouse only partial reactions. We
must admit that the sound, of itself, prompts rather a grasping movement, and visual perception the act of pointing. ‘The sound always
leads us towards its content, its signiﬁcance for us; in visual presentation, on the other hand, we can much more easily “disregard” the
content and we are drawn much more deﬁnitely towards the part of
space where the object is to be found.’38 A meaning then is deﬁnable
less in terms of the indescribable quality of its ‘mental contents’ than in
terms of a certain manner of presenting its object, of its epistemological structure having its quality as concrete realization and, in the
language of Kant, exhibition. The doctor who brings to bear upon the
patient ‘visual’ or ‘auditory stimuli’ believes that he is testing ‘visual’
or ‘auditory sensibility’ and drawing up an inventory of sensible qualities which make up consciousness (in empiricist language) or of the
material at the disposal of cognition (in intellectualist language). The
doctor and the psychologist borrow the concepts of ‘sight’ and ‘hearing’ from common sense which considers them univocal, because our
body includes as a matter of fact sets of visual and auditory apparatus
published under their editorship by Benary, Hocheimer and Steinfeld) they broadened
their diagnosis. The progress of their analysis is a particularly clear example of the
progress of psychology.

which are anatomically distinct and to which isolatable contents of
consciousness are supposed to correspond according to a general postulate of ‘constancy’39 which expresses our natural ignorance of ourselves. But, when taken up and systematically applied by science these
confused concepts hinder research and ﬁnally necessitate a general
revision of these naïve categories. In fact, the measuring of thresholds
tests functions prior to any speciﬁc identiﬁcation of sensible qualities
and to the elaboration of knowledge, the way in which the subject
makes his surroundings exist for him, either as a pole of activity and
the terminus of an act of seizure or expulsion, or else as a spectacle
and theme of knowledge. The motor disturbances of cerebellar cases
and those of psychological blindness can be co-ordinated only if we
identify the basis of movement and vision not as a collection of sensible qualities but as a certain way of giving form or structure to our
environment. We are led back by the very use of this inductive method
to ‘metaphysical’ questions which positivism would wish to avoid.
Induction succeeds only provided that it is not restricted to noting
things as present or absent, with concomitant variations, and that it
conceives and comprehends facts as subsumed under ideas not contained in them. It is not a matter of choosing between a description of
the disorder which furnishes the meaning and an explanation which
provides the cause. There are, moreover, no explanations without
comprehension.
But let us make our objection more explicit. On examination it is
seen to be twofold.
1. The ‘cause’ of a ‘psychic fact’ is never another ‘psychic fact’
capable of being disclosed to straightforward observation. For example,
visual representation does not explain abstract movement, for it is itself
endowed with the same power of throwing out a spectacle which is
revealed in abstract movement and the act of pointing. Now this power
does not come under the senses, not even under any inner sense. Let it
be said provisionally that it is disclosed only to a certain kind of reﬂection, the nature of which we shall examine closely later. It follows that
psychological induction is not a mere inventory of facts. Psychology
does not provide its explanations by identifying, among a collection of
39

Cf. above, Introduction, p. 7.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

facts, the invariable and unconditioned antecedent. It conceives or
comprehends facts in exactly the same way as induction in physical
science, not content to note empirical sequences, creates notions capable of co-ordinating facts. That is why, in psychology as in physics, no
induction can avail itself of any crucial experiment. Since explanation is
not discovered but created, it is never given with the fact, but is always
simply a probable interpretation. So far we have merely applied to
psychology what has been fully demonstrated with regard to physical
induction,40 and our ﬁrst complaint is against the empiricist manner of
conceiving induction and against Mill’s methods.
2. Now we shall see that this ﬁrst objection covers a second one. In
psychology it is not only empiricism that has to be challenged. It is the
inductive method and causal thinking generally. The object of psychology is such that it cannot possibly be expressed as the relations of
function to variable. Let us make these two points clear in some detail.
(i) We notice that Schneider’s motor disturbances are associated
with large-scale deﬁciency of knowledge gained by visual means. We
are therefore tempted to regard psychological blindness as a distinctive
variety of pure tactile behaviour, and, since consciousness of bodily
space and abstract movement, which has potential space in view, are
almost totally absent, we are inclined to conclude that the sense of
touch alone gives us no experience of objective space.41 We shall then
say that touch by itself is not of a kind to provide a background to
movement, that is to say, to set out in front of the moving subject his
departure and arrival points in strict simultaneity. The patient tries to
provide for himself a ‘kinaesthetic background’ by means of preparatory movements, and is successful in thus ‘marking’ the position of his
body at the outset and in launching into the movement, yet this kinaesthetic background is precarious, and could not possibly equal the visual background in constantly relating motion to its points of departure
and arrival throughout the movement’s duration. It is thrown out of
gear by the movement itself and needs to be restored after each phase
of the movement. That is why, as we might put it, Schneider’s abstract
movements have lost their melodic ﬂow, why they are made up of

134 phenomenology of perception
fragments placed end to end, and why they often ‘run oﬀ the rails’ on
the way. The practical ﬁeld which Schneider lacks is none other than
the visual ﬁeld.42 But in order to be justiﬁed in relating, in psychological blindness, the motor to the visual disturbance, and, in the normal subject, the projective function to vision as its invariable and
unconditioned antecedent, then we must be sure that only the visual
data have been aﬀected by the disease and that all other pre-conditions
of behaviour, particularly tactile experience, have been left exactly as
they were in the normal person. Can we conﬁdently maintain this? At
this stage it becomes clear that the facts are ambiguous, that no
experiment is decisive and no explanation ﬁnal. When we observe that
a normal subject is capable of making abstract movements with his eyes
shut, and that the tactile experience of the normal person is suﬃcient
to govern motility, it can always be retorted that the tactile data of the
normal person have received their objective structure from visual data
according to the old conception of the education of the senses. When
we observe that a blind person is able to localize stimuli on the surface of
his body and perform abstract movements—apart from the fact that
there are examples of preparatory movements among the blind, the
reply can always be made that frequent associations have imparted the
qualitative colouring of kinaesthetic impressions to tactile ones and
welded the former into a quasi-simultaneous occurrence.43 Indeed,
many factors in the behaviour of patients44 lead one to suspect some
primary modiﬁcation of tactile experience. For example, a subject may
know how to knock at a door, but he can no longer do so if the door is
hidden or merely out of reach. In the latter case, the patient cannot
perform the action of knocking or opening in a void, even if his eyes are
open and ﬁxed on the door.45 How can we invoke visual failure here, when
the patient enjoys a visual perception of the objective which is ordinarily suﬃcient to govern his movements more or less satisfactorily? Have
we not brought to light a primary disturbance of touch? Clearly, for an
object to be able to produce a movement it must be included in the

patient’s ﬁeld of movement, and the disturbance consists of a shrinkage
in this ﬁeld, which is henceforth limited to objects actually touchable,
and exclusive of that horizon of possible touch which surrounds them
for the normal person. The deﬁciency would appear, in the last resort,
to aﬀect a function much deeper than vision, deeper too than touch
conceived as a collection of given qualities. It appears to concern the
subject’s vital area: that opening upon the world which has the eﬀect
of making objects at present out of reach count notwithstanding for
the normal person; they exist for him as touchable things and are part
of his world of movement. According to this hypothesis, when patients
observe their hand and the goal of their action throughout a movement,46 we must understand this not as a mere ampliﬁcation of a
normal procedure, for the recourse to vision is to be seen as necessitated merely by the collapse of the sense of potential touch. But, on the
strictly inductive plane this interpretation, in which touch is primarily
involved, remains optional, and we may always prefer, with Goldstein,
a diﬀerent one: according to this the patient, wishing to strike, needs a
goal within physical reach, precisely because his sight, in which he is
deﬁcient, is no longer adequate to provide a substantial background to
the movement. There is, then, no fact capable of decisively bearing out
that the tactile experience of patients is or is not identical with that of
normal people, and Goldstein’s conception, like the physical theory,
can always be reconciled with the facts, given some auxiliary hypothesis. No rigorously exclusive interpretation is possible in psychology as
in physics.
However, if we look more closely, we shall see that the impossibility
of a decisive experiment, in psychology, is attributable to special
reasons. It arises from the very nature of the object under investigation,
namely behaviour, and leads to important consequences. Between theories, neither of which is either ruled out or completely vindicated by
the facts, physics can nevertheless choose according to the degree of
probability, that is, according to the number of facts which each succeeds in co-ordinating without loading itself with auxiliary hypotheses
elaborated to meet the needs of the case. In psychology this criterion is
lacking: no auxiliary hypothesis is necessary, as we have seen, to
46

135

136 phenomenology of perception
explain in terms of visual disturbance the impossibility of the action of
‘knocking’ in front of a door. Not only do we never arrive at an
exclusive interpretation (deﬁciency of sense of potential touch or
deﬁciency of visual world), but, what is more, we necessarily have to
do with equally probable interpretations because ‘visual representations’,
‘abstract movement’ and ‘sense of potential touch’ are only diﬀerent
names for one and the same central phenomenon. Hence psychology is
not in the same position as physics; that is to say, conﬁned within the
probability of inductions, it is unable to choose, even on the basis of
plausibility, between hypotheses which from a strictly inductive point
of view remain incompatible. For an induction, even when it is merely
probable, to remain a possibility, the ‘visual representation’ or the
‘tactile perception’ must be the cause of the abstract movement, or
alternatively both must be eﬀects of another cause. The three or four
terms must be able to be considered from the outside and we must be
able to pick out the correlative variations. But if they should prove
incapable of being isolated, if each of them presupposed the rest, the
failure involved would not be a failure of empiricism or of attempts to
ﬁnd a decisive experiment, it would be the failure of the inductive
method or of causal thinking in the realm of psychology. We thus
arrive at the second point that we were trying to make.
(ii) If, as Goldstein recognizes, the co-existence of the tactile with
the visual data, in the case of the normal person, modiﬁes the former
suﬃciently to enable them to provide a background for abstract
movement, the tactile data of the patient, which are cut oﬀ from the
visual contribution, cannot be forthwith identiﬁed with those of the
normal person. Tactile and visual data, says Goldstein, are not juxtaposed in the normal person; the former derive from the proximity of
the latter a ‘qualitative colouring’ which they have lost for Schneider. It
follows, he adds, that the study of the purely tactile is impossible as far
as the normal person is concerned, and that derangement alone
provides a picture of what tactile experience reduced to itself would
comprise.47 The conclusion is sound, but it amounts to maintaining
that the word ‘touch’ has not the same meaning applied to the normal
as to the abnormal subject, that the ‘purely tactile’ is a pathological
47

Über den Einﬂuss . . . , pp. 227 and ﬀ.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

phenomenon which does not enter as a component into normal
experience. It is further implied that illness, by disturbing the visual
function, has not disclosed the pure essence of touch, that it has indeed
changed the whole of the subject’s experience, or, if one prefers it put
in this way, that there is not in the normal subject a tactile experience
and also a visual one, but an integrated experience to which it is
impossible to gauge the contribution of each sense. The experiences
mediated by touch in psychological blindness have nothing in common with those which touch mediates in the normal subject, and
neither set really deserves to be called ‘tactile’ data. Tactile experience is
not a condition apart which might be kept constant while the ‘visual’
experience was varied with a view to pinning on to each its own
causality, nor is behaviour a function of these variables. It is on the
contrary presupposed in deﬁning them just as each is presupposed
in deﬁning the other.48 Psychological blindness, deﬁciency of sense
of touch and motor disturbances are three expressions of a more
fundamental disturbance through which they can be understood and
48

On the conditioning of sensory data by motility, cf. Structure du Comportement, p. 41, and
the experiments which show that a dog when chained up does not perceive as does a dog
free in its movements. The procedures of traditional psychology are strangely mixed, in
the writings of Gelb and Goldstein, with the concrete emphasis derived from Gestalt
psychology. They recognize clearly enough that the perceiving subject reacts as a whole,
but the totality is conceived as a mixture and touch receives from its co-existence with
sight only a ‘qualitative colouring’, whereas according to the spirit of Gestalt psychology, two sensory realms can communicate only by becoming absorbed as inseparable
constituents into an intersensory system. Now if tactile data, along with visual ones,
make up a composite formation, it is clearly on condition that they themselves, on their
own ground, bring into being a spatial organization, for otherwise the connection
between touch and sight would be an external association, and the tactile data would
remain, in the total conﬁguration, what they are taken each in isolation—two consequences equally ruled out by Gestalt theory. It is fair to add that, in another work
(Bericht über den IX Kongress für experimentelle Psychologie in München, Die psychologische Bedeutung pathologischer Störungen der Raumwahrnehmung), Gelb himself points out the
inadequacy of the work which we have just analysed. We may not even speak, he says, of
a coalescence of touch and sight in the normal subject, or even make any distinction
between these two components in reactions to space. Both pure tactile and pure visual
experience, with its space of juxtaposition and its represented spaces, are products of
analysis. There is a concrete manipulation of space in which all senses collaborate in
an ‘undiﬀerentiated unity’ (p. 76) and the sense of touch is ill-adapted only to the
theoretical knowledge of space.

137

138 phenomenology of perception
not three component factors of morbid behaviour. Visual representations, tactile data and motility are three phenomena which stand out
sharply within the unity of behaviour. When, by reason of the fact that
they show correlated variations, we try to explain one in terms of the
other, we forget, for example, that the act of visual representation, as is
proved in cerebellar cases, already presupposes the same power of projection as is seen in abstract movement and in the act of pointing out,
and thus we beg the question. Inductive and causal thought, by vesting
in vision or touch or any one de facto datum the power of projection
which is found in them all, conceals that power from us and blinds us
to that dimension of behaviour which is precisely the one with which
psychology is concerned. In physics, the establishment of a law
requires the scientist to conceive the idea under which the facts are to
be co-ordinated, and this idea, which is not found in the facts, will
never be veriﬁed by any conclusive experiment, and will never be more
than probable. But it is still the idea of a causal link, in the sense of a
relationship of function to variable. Atmospheric pressure had to be
invented but, after all, it was still a third person process, the function of
a certain number of variables. In so far as behaviour is a form, in which
‘visual’ and ‘tactile contents’, sensibility and motility appear only as
inseparable moments, it remains inaccessible to causal thought and is
capable of being apprehended only by another kind of thought, that
which grasps its object as it comes into being and as it appears to the
person experiencing it, with the atmosphere of meaning then surrounding it, and which tries to inﬁltrate into that atmosphere in order
to discover, behind scattered facts and symptoms, the subject’s whole
being, when he is normal, or the basic disturbance, when he is a
patient.
We cannot explain disturbances in the power of abstract movement
in terms of loss of visual contents, nor, consequently, the function of
projection in terms of the actual presence of these contents. So one
method alone still seems possible: it consists in reconstituting the basic
disturbance by going back from the symptoms not to a cause which is
itself observable, but to a reason or intelligible condition of possibility
for the state of aﬀairs. It involves treating the human subject as an
irresolvable consciousness which is wholly present in every one of its
manifestations. If the disturbance is not to be related to the contents, it

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

must be linked to the form of knowledge; if psychology is not empiricist and explicative, it ought to be rationalistic and reﬂective. In exactly
the same way as the act of naming,49 the act of pointing out presupposes that the object, instead of being approached, grasped and
absorbed by the body, is kept at a distance and stands as a picture in
front of the patient. Plato still allowed the empiricist the power of
pointing a ﬁnger at things, but the truth is that even this silent gesture
is impossible if what is pointed out is not already torn from instantaneous existence and monadic existence, and treated as representative
of its previous appearances in me, and of its simultaneous appearances
in others, in other words, subsumed under some category and promoted to the status of a concept. If the patient is no longer able to point
to some part of his body which is touched, it is because he is no longer
a subject face to face with an objective world, and can no longer take
up a ‘categorial attitude’.50 In the same way, abstract movement is
endangered in so far as it presupposes awareness of an objective, is
borne on by that awareness, and is movement for itself. Indeed it is not
triggered oﬀ by any existing object, but is clearly centrifugal, outlining
in space a gratuitous intention which has reference to one’s own body,
making an object of it instead of going through it to link up with
things by means of it. It is, then, diﬀused with a power of objectiﬁcation, a ‘symbolical function’,51 a ‘representative function’,52 a power of
‘projection’53 which is, moreover, already at work in forming ‘things’.
It consists in treating sense-data as mutually representative, and also
collectively representative of an ‘eidos’; in giving a meaning to these
data, in breathing a spirit into them, in systematizing them, in centring
a plurality of experiences round one intelligible core, in bringing to
light in them an identiﬁable unity when seen in diﬀerent perspectives.
To sum up, it consists in placing beneath the ﬂow of impressions an
explanatory invariant, and in giving a form to the stuﬀ of experience.
Now it is not possible to maintain that consciousness has this power, it is
this power itself. As soon as there is consciousness, and in order that

there may be consciousness, there must be something to be conscious
of, an intentional object, and consciousness can move towards this
object only to the extent that it ‘deralizes’ itself and throws itself into it,
only if it is wholly in this reference to . . . something, only if it is a pure
meaning-giving act. If a being is consciousness, he must be nothing
but a network of intentions. If he ceases to be deﬁnable in terms of the
act of sense-giving, he relapses into the condition of a thing, the thing
being precisely what does not know, what slumbers in absolute ignorance of itself and the world, what consequently is not a true ‘self ’, i.e. a
‘for-itself ’, and has only a spatio-temporal form of individuation,
existence in itself.54 Consciousness, therefore, does not admit of degree.
If the patient no longer exists as a consciousness, he must then exist as a
thing. Either movement is movement for itself, in which case the
‘stimulus’ is not its cause but its intentional object—or else it disintegrates and is dispersed in existence in itself, and becomes an objective
process in the body, whose phases are successive but unknown to each
other. The special status of concrete movements in illness is explained
by seeing them as reﬂexes in the traditional sense. The patient’s hand
meets the point on his body where the mosquito has settled because
pre-established nerve circuits, not the excitation, control the reaction.
Actions performed in the course of his work are preserved because they
are dependent upon ﬁrmly rooted conditioned reﬂexes. They persist in
spite of psychic deﬁciencies because they are movements in themselves. The distinction between concrete and abstract movement,
between Greifen and Zeigen comes down to that between the physiological and the psychic, existence in itself and existence for itself.55
54

Husserl has often been credited with this distinction. In fact, it is found in Descartes
and Kant. In our opinion Husserl’s originality lies beyond the notion of intentionality; it
is to be found in the elaboration of this notion and in the discovery, beneath the
intentionality of representations, of a deeper intentionality, which others have called
existence.
55
Gelb and Goldstein sometimes tend to interpret phenomena in this sense. They have
done more than anyone to go beyond the traditional dualism of automatism and consciousness. But they have never named this third term between the psychic and the physiological, between the for itself and the in itself to which their analyses always led them and
which we call existence. Hence their earliest works often fall back on the traditional
dichotomy of body and consciousness: ‘The act of seizing is, much more than that of
pointing, determined by relationships existing between the organism and its surrounding

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

But we shall see that in reality the ﬁrst distinction, far from covering
also the second, is incompatible with it. Every ‘physiological explanation’ tends to become generalized. If the grasping action or the concrete movement is guaranteed by some factual connection between
each point on the skin and the motor muscles which guide the hand, it
is diﬃcult to see why the same nerve circuit communicating a scarcely
diﬀerent movement to the same muscles should not guarantee the
gesture of Zeigen as it does the movement of Greifen. Between the mosquito which pricks the skin and the ruler which the doctor presses on
the same spot, the physical diﬀerence is not great enough to explain
why the grasping movement is possible, but the act of pointing impossible. The two ‘stimuli’ are really distinguishable only if we take into
account their aﬀective value or biological meaning, and the two
responses cease to merge into one another only if we consider the Zeigen
and the Greifen as two ways of relating to the object and two types of
being in the world. But this is precisely what cannot be done once we
have reduced the living body to the condition of an object. If it is once
conceded that it may be the seat of third person processes, nothing in
behaviour can be reserved for consciousness. Both gestures and movements, employing as they do the same organ-objects, the same nerveobjects, must be given their place on the map of interiorless processes,
ﬁeld . . . ; it is less a question of relations consciously formed than of immediate reactions
. . . , we are here concerned with a much more vital process, one describable in biological language as primitive.’ (Zeigen und Greifen, p. 459.) ‘The act of seizing remains
completely insensitive to modiﬁcations aﬀecting the conscious part of this performance,
to any deﬁciency of simultaneous apprehension (in psychological blindness), to the
instability of perceived space (in cerebellar cases), to disturbances of sensitivity (in
certain cortical lesions), because it is not carried out in this objective domain. It is
preserved as long as the peripheral excitations are still suﬃcient to govern it accurately.’
(Zeigen und Greifen, p. 460.) Gelb and Goldstein question the existence of localizing reﬂex
movements (Henri), but only in so far as there might be a tendency to regard them as
innate. They retain the idea of an ‘automatic localization not inclusive of any awareness
of space, since it operates even during sleep’ (thus conceived as total unconsciousness). It
is certainly ‘learnt’ from the time of comprehensive reactions of the whole body to tactile
stimuli in babyhood—but this apprenticeship is conceived as the accumulation of ‘kinesthetic residues’ which are ‘awakened’ in the normal adult by external excitations, and
which direct him towards the appropriate outlets (Über den Einﬂuss . . . , pp. 167–206). In
correctly performing the actions required by his trade, Schneider shows that they are
habitual totalities which demand no consciousness of space (ibid., pp. 221–2).

141

142 phenomenology of perception
and inserted in the compactly woven stuﬀ of ‘physiological conditions’. Does not the patient who, in doing his job, moves his hand
towards a tool lying on the table, displace the segments of his arm
exactly as he would have to do to perform the abstract movement of
extending it? Does not an everyday gesture involve a series of muscular
contractions and innervations? It is therefore impossible to set limits to
physiological explanation. On the other hand, it is impossible also to
set limits to consciousness. If we relate the act of pointing to consciousness, if once the stimulus can cease to be the cause of the reaction
and become its intentional object, it becomes inconceivable that it
should ever function as a pure cause or that the movement should ever
be blind. For if ‘abstract’ movements are possible, in which consciousness of the starting and ﬁnishing points is present, we must at every
moment in our life know where our body is without having to look for
it as we look for an object moved from its place during our absence.
Even ‘automatic’ movements must therefore announce themselves to
our consciousness, which means that there never occur, in our bodies,
movements in themselves. And if all objective space is for intellectual
consciousness only, we must ﬁnd the categorical attitude even in the
movement of grasping itself.56 Like physiological causality, arrival at
self-awareness has nowhere to start. We must either reject physiological
explanation or admit that it is all-inclusive—either deny consciousness
or accept it as comprehensive. We cannot relate certain movements to
bodily mechanism and others to consciousness. The body and consciousness are not mutually limiting, they can be only parallel. Any
physiological explanation becomes generalized into mechanistic
physiology, any achievement of self-awareness into intellectualist
psychology, and mechanistic physiology or intellectualist psychology
bring behaviour down to the same uniform level and wipe out the
distinction between abstract and concrete movement, between Zeigen
56

Goldstein himself, who tended (as we have seen in the preceding note) to relate Greifen
to the body and Zeigen to the categorical attitude, is forced to go back on this ‘explanation’. The act of grasping, he says, may ‘be performed to order, and the patient tries to
grasp. In order to do so he does not need to be aware of the point in space towards which
he thrusts forward his hand, but he nevertheless has a feeling of orientation in space . . . ’
(Zeigen und Greifen, p. 461). The act of grasping, as found in normal subjects, ‘still demands
a categorial and conscious attitude’ (ibid., p. 465).

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

and Greifen. This distinction can survive only if there are several ways for the
body to be a body, several ways for consciousness to be consciousness. As long as the
body is deﬁned in terms of existence in-itself, it functions uniformly
like a mechanism, and as long as the mind is deﬁned in terms of pure
existence for-itself, it knows only objects arrayed before it. The distinction between abstract and concrete movement is therefore not to
be confused with that between body and consciousness; it does
not belong to the same reﬂective dimension, but ﬁnds its place only in
the behavioural dimension. Pathological phenomena introduce variations before our eyes in something which is not the pure awareness of
an object. Any diagnosis, like that of intellectualist psychology, which
sees here a collapse of consciousness and the freeing of automatism, or
again that of an empiricist psychology of contents, would leave the
fundamental disturbance untouched.
The intellectualist analysis, here as everywhere, is less false than
abstract. It is true that the ‘symbolic function’ or the ‘representative
function’ underlies our movements, but it is not a ﬁnal term for analysis. It too rests on a certain groundwork. The mistake of intellectualism
is to make it self-subsistent, to remove it from the stuﬀ in which it is
realized, and to recognize in us, as a non-derivative entity, an undistanced presence in the world. For, using this consciousness, an entirely
transparent consciousness, this intentionality which admits of no
degrees of more or less, as a starting point, everything that separates us
from the real world—error, sickness, madness, in short incarnation—is
reduced to the status of mere appearance. Admittedly intellectualism
does not bring consciousness into being independently of its material.
For example it takes great care not to introduce behind the word, the
action and the perception, any ‘symbolic consciousness’ as the common and numerically sole form of linguistic, perceptual and motor
material. There is no ‘general symbolic faculty’, says Cassirer,57 and
analytical reﬂection does not seek to establish between pathological
phenomena relating to perception, language and action a ‘community
in being’, but a ‘community in meaning’.58 Just because it has ﬁnally
gone beyond causal thought and realism, intellectualist psychology

144 phenomenology of perception
would be able to see the meaning or essence of illness, and recognize a
unity of consciousness which is not evident on the plane of being, and
which is vouched for, in its own eyes, on the plane of truth. But the
distinction between community in being and community in sense, the
conscious passage from the existential order to the order of value and
the transvaluation which allows meaning and value to be declared
autonomous are, for practical purposes, equivalent to an abstraction,
since, from the point of view ﬁnally adopted, the variety of phenomena
becomes insigniﬁcant and incomprehensible. If consciousness is placed
outside being, the latter cannot breach it, the empirical variety of
consciousnesses—morbid, primitive, childlike consciousness, the consciousness of others—cannot be taken seriously, there is nothing to be
known or understood, one thing alone makes sense: the pure essence
of consciousness. None of these consciousnesses could fail to eﬀect the
Cogito. The lunatic, behind his ravings, his obsessions and lies, knows that he
is raving, that he is allowing himself to be haunted by an obsession,
that he is lying, in short he is not mad, he thinks he is. All is then for the
best and insanity is only perversion of the will. The analysis of the
meaning of illness, once it ends with the symbolic function, identiﬁes
all disorders as the same, uniting aphasia, apraxia and agnosia59 and
perhaps even has no way of distinguishing them from schizophrenia.60
It then becomes understandable that doctors and psychologists should
decline the invitation to intellectualism and fall back, for want of anything better, on the attempts at causal explanation which at least have
the merit of taking into account what is peculiar to illness, and to each
form of it, and which by this means give at any rate the illusion of
possessing actual knowledge. Modern pathology shows that there is no
strictly elective disturbance, but it shows equally that each one is coloured by the sector of behaviour which it principally attacks.61 Even if
all aphasia, when closely observed, is seen to involve disturbances of

60
One can indeed imagine an intellectualist interpretation of schizophrenia which
would equate the atomistic conception of time and the loss of the future with a collapse
of the categorial attitude.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

both gnosic* and praxic kinds; if all apraxia† involves linguistic and
perceptual disturbances, and all agnosia‡ disturbances of language and
action, the fact remains that the core of these disorders is here to be
found in the domain of language, there in that of perception, and
elsewhere in that of action. When we invoke in all these cases the
symbolic function, we are, it is true, characterizing the structure common to the diﬀerent derangements, but this structure should not be
separated from the stuﬀ through which on each occasion it is realized,
if not electively, at least in great measure. After all Schneider’s trouble
was not initially metaphysical, for it was a shell splinter which
wounded him at the back of the head. The damage to his sight was
serious, but it would be ridiculous, as we have said, to explain all the
other deﬁciencies in terms of the visual one as their cause; but no less
ridiculous to think that the shell splinter directly struck symbolic
consciousness. It was through his sight that mind in him was impaired.
Until some means has been discovered whereby we can link the
origin and the essence or meaning of the disturbance; until some
deﬁnition is found for a concrete essence, a structure of illness which shall
express both its generality and its particularity, until phenomenology
becomes genetic phenomenology, unhelpful reversions to causal
thought and naturalism will remain justiﬁed. Our problem therefore
becomes clearer. The task for us is to conceive, between the linguistic,
perceptual and motor contents and the form given to them or the
symbolic function which breathes life into them, a relationship which
shall be neither the reduction of form to content, nor the subsuming of
content under an autonomous form. We need to understand both how
Schneider’s complaint everywhere overshoots particular contents—
visual, tactile and motor—of his experience, and how it nevertheless
attacks the symbolic function only through the specially chosen

material provided by sight. The senses and one’s own body generally
present the mystery of a collective entity which, without abandoning
its thisness and its individuality, puts forth beyond itself meanings
capable of providing a framework for a whole series of thoughts and
experiences. Although Schneider’s trouble aﬀects motility and thought
as well as perception, the fact remains that what it damages, particularly
in the domain of thought, is his power of apprehending simultaneous
wholes, and in the matter of motility, that, so to speak, of taking a
bird’s-eye view of movement and projecting it outside himself. It is
then in some sense mental space and practical space which are destroyed or impaired, and the words themselves are a suﬃcient indication of the visual origin of the disturbance. Visual trouble is not the
cause of the other disturbances, particularly that directly aﬀecting
thought. But neither is it a mere consequence of them. Visual contents,
moreover, are not the cause of the function of projection, but neither is
sight a mere opportunity given to Mind to bring into play a power in
itself unconditioned. Visual contents are taken up, utilized and sublimated to the level of thought by a symbolical power which transcends
them, but it is on the basis of sight that this power can be constituted.
The relationship between matter and form is called in phenomenological terminology a relationship of Fundierung: the symbolic function
rests on the visual as on a ground; not that vision is its cause, but
because it is that gift of nature which Mind was called upon to make
use of beyond all hope, to which it was to give a fundamentally new
meaning, yet which was needed, not only to be incarnate, but in order
to be at all. Form integrates within itself the content until the latter
ﬁnally appears as a mere mode of form itself, and the historical stages
leading up to thought as a ruse of Reason disguised as Nature. But
conversely, even in its intellectual sublimation, content remains in the
nature of a radical contingency, the initial establishment or foundation62 of knowledge and action, the ﬁrst laying hold of being or value,
whose concrete richness will never be ﬁnally exhausted by knowledge
and action, and whose spontaneous method they will ceaselessly
reapply. This dialectic of form and content is what we have to restore,
or rather, since ‘reciprocal action’ is as yet only a compromise with
62

We are translating Husserl’s favourite word: Stiftung.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

causal thought, and a contradictory principle, we have to describe the
circumstances under which this contradiction is conceivable, which
means existence, the perpetual re-ordering of fact and hazard by a
reason non-existent before and without those circumstances.63
If we want to observe what underlies the ‘symbolic function’ itself,
we must ﬁrst of all realize that even intelligence is not reconcilable with
intellectualism. What impairs thought in Schneider’s case is not that he
is incapable of perceiving concrete data as specimens of a unique eidos,
or of subsuming them under some category, but on the contrary, that
he can relate them only by a quite explicit subsumption. It is noticeable, for example, that the patient does not understand even such
simple analogies as: ‘fur is to cat as plumage is to bird’, or ‘light is to
lamp as heat is to stove’, or ‘eye is to light and colour as ear is to
sounds’. In the same way he cannot understand, in their metaphorical
sense, such common expressions as ‘the chair leg’ or ‘the head of a
nail’, although he knows what part of the object is indicated by these
words. It may happen that normal subjects of equal educational standard are no more able to explain the analogy, but this is for diametrically
opposed reasons. It is easier for the normal subject to understand the
analogy than to analyse it, whereas the patient manages to understand
only when he has made it explicit by recourse to conceptual analysis.
‘He looks for . . . a common material characteristic from which he can
infer, as from a middle term, the identity of the two relationships’.64
For example, he thinks about the analogy between eye and ear and
63

See below third part. E. Cassirer clearly has the same aim when he takes Kant to task for
having most of the time analysed only an ‘intellectual sublimation of experience’ (Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen, T. III, p. 14), when he tries to express, through the notion of
symbolic pregnancy, the absolute simultaneity of matter and form, or when he adopts
for his own purposes Hegel’s declaration that the mind carries and preserves its past in
the depths of its present. But the relationships between the various symbolic forms
remain ambiguous. One always wonders whether the function of Darstellung is a stage in
the return to itself of an eternal consciousness, the shadow of the function of Bedeutung—
or whether, on the contrary, the function of Bedeutung is an unforesecable ampliﬁcation
of the ﬁrst constitutive ‘wave’. When Cassirer takes up the Kantian formula according to
which consciousness can analyse only what it has synthesized, he is manifestly returning
to intellectualism despite the phenomenological and even existential analyses which his
book contains and which we shall have occasion to use.

147

148 phenomenology of perception
clearly does not understand it until he can say: ‘The eye and the ear are
both sense organs, therefore they must give rise to something similar.’ If
we described analogy as the apperception of two given terms under a
co-ordinating concept, we should be giving as normal a procedure
which is exclusively pathological, and which represents the roundabout
way in which the patient makes good the normal understanding of
analogy. ‘This freedom in choosing a tertium comparationis on the patient’s
part is the opposite of the intuitive formation of the image in the normal
subject: the latter seizes a speciﬁc identity in conceptual structures, for
him the living processes of thought are symmetrical and mutually complementary. Thus does he ‘catch’ the essential feature of the analogy,
and one may always wonder whether a subject does not remain able to
understand, even when this understanding is not adequately expressed
through the formulation and clariﬁcation which he provides.’65 Living
thought, then, does not consist in subsuming under some category. The
category imposes on the terms brought together a meaning external to
them. It is by drawing upon already constituted language and upon the
sense-relationships which it holds in store that Schneider succeeds in
relating eye to ear as ‘sense-organs’. In normal thought eye and ear are
immediately apprehended in accordance with the analogy of their function, and their relationship can be ﬁxed in a ‘common characteristic’
and recorded in language only because it has ﬁrst been perceived in its
origin in the singularity of sight and hearing.
It will perhaps be objected that our criticism is valid only against a
summary intellectualism which absorbs thought into a purely logical
activity, whereas analytical reﬂection goes back to the origin of predication, ﬁnding behind the judgement of inherence that of relation,
behind subsumption, seen as a mechanical and formal operation, the
categorial act whereby thought bestows upon the subject the meaning
expressed in the predicate. Thus our criticism of the categorial function, it might be said, does nothing but reveal, behind the empirical
use of the category, a transcendental use without which indeed the ﬁrst
is incomprehensible. The distinction, however, between the empirical
and transcendental use conceals the problem rather than solves it. Critical philosophy duplicates the empirical operations of thought with a
65

Benary, Studien zur Untersuchung der Intelligenz bei einem Fall von Seelenblindheit, p. 263.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

transcendental activity which has the task of bringing about all those
syntheses for which empirical thought provides the elements. But
when I think something at the present moment, the guarantee of a
non-temporal synthesis is insuﬃcient and even unnecessary as a basis
of my thought. It is now, in the living present that the synthesis has to
be eﬀected, otherwise thought would be cut oﬀ from its transcendental
premises. It cannot therefore be asserted that when I think I take my
place once more in the eternal subject which I have never ceased to be.
For the true subject of thought is the person who achieves the conversion and resumption of action at this very moment, and it is he who
breathes his own life into the non-temporal ghost. We need therefore
to understand how temporal thought links up with itself and brings
about its own synthesis. The fact that the normal subject immediately
grasps that the eye is to sight as the ear is to hearing shows that the eye
and ear are immediately given to him as means of access to one and the
same world, and furthermore that one world is for him antepredicatively
self-evident, so that the equivalence of the ‘sense-organs’ and their
analogy is to be read oﬀ from things and can be lived before being
conceived. The Kantian subject posits a world, but, in order to be able
to assert a truth, the actual subject must in the ﬁrst place have a world
or be in the world, that is, sustain round about it a system of meanings
whose reciprocities, relationships and involvements do not require to
be made explicit in order to be exploited. When I move about my
house, I know without thinking about it that walking towards the
bathroom means passing near the bedroom, that looking at the window means having the ﬁreplace on my left, and in this small world
each gesture, each perception is immediately located in relation to a
great number of possible co-ordinates. When I chat with a friend
whom I know well, each of his remarks and each of mine contains, in
addition to the meaning it carries for everybody else, a host of references to the main dimensions of his character and mine, without our
needing to recall previous conversations with each other. These
acquired worlds, which confer upon my experience its secondary
meaning, are themselves carved out of a primary world which is the
basis of the primary meaning. In the same way there is a ‘world of
thoughts’, or a sediment left by our mental processes, which enables us
to rely on our concepts and acquired judgements as we might on

149

150 phenomenology of perception
things there in front of us, presented globally, without there being any
need for us to resynthesize them.
In this way there can be for us a sort of mental panorama, with its
clear-cut and its vague areas, a physiognomic disposition of questions
and intellectual situations, such as research, discovery and certainty.
But the word ‘sediment’ should not lead us astray: this acquired knowledge is not an inert mass in the depths of our consciousness. My ﬂat is,
for me, not a set of closely associated images. It remains a familiar
domain round about me only as long as I still have ‘in my hands’ or ‘in
my legs’ the main distances and directions involved, and as long as
from my body intentional threads run out towards it. Similarly my
acquired thoughts are not a ﬁnal gain, they continually draw their
sustenance from my present thought, they oﬀer me a meaning, but I
give it back to them. Indeed our available store expresses for ever afresh
the energy of our present consciousness. Sometimes it weakens, as in
moments of weariness, and then my ‘world’ of thought is impoverished and reduced to one or two obsessive ideas; sometimes, on the
other hand, I am at the disposal of all my thoughts and every word
spoken in front of me then stimulates questions and ideas, recasting
and reorganizing the mental panorama, and presenting itself with a
precise physiognomy. Thus what is acquired is truly acquired only if it
is taken up again in a fresh momentum of thought, and a thought is
assigned to its place only if it takes up its place itself. The essence of
consciousness is to provide itself with one or several worlds, to bring
into being its own thoughts before itself, as if they were things, and it
demonstrates its vitality indivisibly by outlining these landscapes for
itself and then by abandoning them. The world-structure, with its two
stages of sedimentation and spontaneity, is at the core of consciousness, and it is in the light of a levelling-down of the ‘world’ that we
shall succeed in understanding Schneider’s intellectual, perceptual and
motor disturbances, without assimilating them to each other.
The traditional analysis of perception66 distinguishes within it

We are holding over until the second part a closer study of perception, and we here
conﬁne our remarks to what is essential for the elucidation of the basic and also the
motor disturbance in Schneider’s case. These anticipations and repetitions are unavoidable if, as we shall try to show, perception and experience of one’s own body are
mutually implied.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

sense-givens and the meaning which they receive from an act of
understanding. Perceptual disturbances, from this point of view, could
be only sensory deﬁciencies or gnosic disturbances. Schneider’s case,
on the other hand, shows deﬁciencies aﬀecting the junction of sensitivity and signiﬁcance, deﬁciencies which disclose the existential conditioning of both. If a fountain pen is shown to the patient, in such a
way that the clip is not seen, the phases of recognition are as follows. ‘It
is black, blue and shiny,’ says the patient. ‘There is a white patch on it,
and it is rather long; it has the shape of a stick. It may be some sort of
instrument. It shines and reﬂects light. It could also be a coloured
glass.’ The pen is then brought closer and the clip is turned towards the
patient. He goes on: ‘It must be a pencil or a fountain pen.’ (He
touches his breast pocket). ‘It is put there, to make notes with.’67 It is
clear that language intervenes at every stage of recognition by providing possible meanings for what is in fact seen, and that recognition
advances pari passu with linguistic connections: from ‘long’ to ‘shaped
like a stick’, from ‘stick’ to ‘instrument’, and from there to ‘instrument
for noting things down’, and ﬁnally to ‘fountain pen’. The sensory
givens are limited to suggesting these meanings as a fact suggests a
hypothesis to the physicist. The patient, like the scientist, veriﬁes mediately and clariﬁes his hypothesis by cross-checking facts, and makes his
way blindly towards the one which co-ordinates them all.
This procedure contrasts with, and by so doing throws into relief,
the spontaneous method of normal perception, that kind of living
system of meanings which makes the concrete essence of the object
immediately recognizable, and allows its ‘sensible properties’ to appear
only through that essence. It is this familiarity and communication
with the object which is here interrupted. In the normal subject the
object ‘speaks’ and is signiﬁcant, the arrangement of colours straight
away ‘means’ something, whereas in the patient the meaning has to be
brought in from elsewhere by a veritable act of interpretation. Conversely in the normal person the subject’s intentions are immediately
reﬂected in the perceptual ﬁeld, polarizing it, or placing their seal upon
it, or setting up in it, eﬀortlessly, a wave of signiﬁcance. In the patient
the perceptual ﬁeld has lost this plasticity. If he is asked to make a

151

152 phenomenology of perception
square with four triangles identical with a given one, he replies that it
is impossible and that with four triangles only two squares can be built.
The experimenter insists, showing him that a square has two diagonals
and can always be divided into four triangles. The patient’s reply is:
‘Yes, but that is because the parts necessarily ﬁt each other. When a
square is divided into four, if the parts are brought together in the
correct way, they must make a square.’68 He knows therefore what a
square and a triangle are; even the relationship between these two
meanings does not escape him, at least after the doctor’s explanations,
and he understands that any square can be split into triangles. But he
does not go on to conclude that any right-angled isosceles triangle can
be used to construct a square, because the construction of this square
requires that the given triangles be arranged diﬀerently and that the
sensory-givens must become the means of illustration of an imaginary
meaning. The world in its entirety no longer suggests any meaning to
him and conversely the meanings which occur to him are not
embodied any longer in the given world. We shall say, in a word, that
the world no longer has any physiognomy for him.69 This is what reveals
the nature of the peculiarities seen in his drawings. Schneider never
draws from the model (nachzeichnen); perception is not carried directly
into movement. With his left hand he feels the object, recognizes certain characteristics (a corner, a right angle), formulates his discovery
and ﬁnally draws without any model a ﬁgure corresponding to the
verbal formula.70
The translation of percept into movement is eﬀected via the express
meanings of language, whereas the normal subject penetrates into the
object by perception, assimilating its structure into his substance, and
through this body the object directly regulates his movements.71 This
subject-object dialogue, this drawing together, by the subject, of the

meaning diﬀused through the object, and, by the object, of the subject’s intentions—a process which is physiognomic perception—
arranges round the subject a world which speaks to him of himself,
and gives his own thoughts their place in the world. Since this function
is impaired in Schneider’s case, it is foreseeable that, a fortiori, perception of human events and other people will show deﬁciencies, for these
presuppose the same taking up of external by internal and of internal
by external. And indeed if a story is told to the patient, it is observed
that instead of grasping it as a melodic whole with down and up beats,
with its characteristic rhythm or ﬂow, he remembers it only as a succession of facts to be noted one by one. That is why he can understand
it only if pauses are made in the narrative and used to sum up brieﬂy
the gist of what he has so far been told. When he tells back the story, he
never does so according to the account given to him (nacherzählen): he ﬁnds
nothing to emphasize; he can understand the course of the story only
as he tells it, and it is, as it were, reconstituted part by part.72 There is,
then, in the normal subject an essence of the story which emerges as it
is told, without any express analysis, and this subsequently guides
along any reproduction of the narrative. The story for him is a certain
human event, recognizable by its style, and here the subject ‘understands’ because he has the power to live, beyond his immediate experience, through the events described. Generally speaking, nothing but
what is immediately given is present to the speaker. The thought of
others will never be present to him, since he has no immediate experience of it.73 The words of others are for him signs which have to be
severally deciphered, instead of being, as with the normal subject, the
transparent envelope of a meaning within which he might live. Like
events, words are for the patient not the theme of an act of drawing together or projecting, but merely the occasion for a methodical
72

Benary, op. cit., p. 279.
Of a conversation of importance to him, he recalls only the general theme and the
decision taken at the end of it, but not his interlocutor’s words: ‘I know what I said in a
conversation from the reasons I had for saying it: what the other said is more diﬃcult
because I have nothing to hold on to (Anhaltspunkt) in order to remember’ (Benary, op.
cit., p. 214). It can be seen, furthermore, that the patient reconstitutes and infers his own
attitude at the time of the conversation, and that he is incapable of directly ‘taking hold’
even of his own thoughts.

interpretation. Like the object, other people ‘tell’ him nothing, and the
phantoms which present themselves to him are devoid, not, it is true,
of that intellectual meaning arrived at through analysis, but that
primary meaning reached through co-existence.
Speciﬁcally intellectual disturbances, those of judgement and
meaning—cannot be considered ultimate deﬁciencies, and must also
be placed in the same existential context. Take, for example, ‘number
blindness’.74 It has been possible to demonstrate that the patient,
though able to count, add, subtract, multiply or divide in relation to the
things placed in front of him, cannot conceive number, and that all his
results are obtained by ritual procedures, which have no signiﬁcant
bearing on it. He knows by heart the sequence of numbers and recites
it mentally, while checking oﬀ on his ﬁngers the objects to be counted,
added, subtracted, multiplied or divided: ‘a number for him merely
belongs to a sequence of numbers, and has no meaning as a ﬁxed
quantity, as a group or a determinate measure.’75 Of two numbers the
greater for him is the one which comes ‘after’ in the numerical series.
When he is given 5 + 4 − 4 to work out, he does the sum in two stages
without ‘noticing anything in particular’. He merely agrees, if it is
pointed out to him, that the number 5 ‘remains’. He fails to understand
that ‘twice half ’ a given number is the number itself.76 Are we then to
say that he has lost number as a category or schema? Yet when he runs
his eyes over the objects to be counted, checking each of them on his
ﬁngers, even though it often happens that he confuses objects already
counted with those still to come, even though the synthesis may be
vague, he obviously has the notion of a synthetic operation which is
nothing other than numeration. And conversely, with the normal subject the sequence of numbers as a kinetic melody practically devoid of
genuinely numerical meaning is most often substituted for the concept
of number. Number is never a pure concept, the absence of which
would allow us to deﬁne Schneider’s mental state, it is a structure of
consciousness involving degrees of more or less. The true act of counting requires of the subject that his operations as they develop and cease

to occupy the centre of his consciousness, shall not cease to be there for
him and shall constitute, for subsequent operations, a ground on which
they may be established. Consciousness holds in reserve, behind itself,
completed syntheses; these are still available and might be brought
back into action, and it is on this basis that they are taken up and
transcended in the total act of numeration. What is called pure number
or authentic number is only a development or extension, through repetition, of the process which constitutes any perception. Schneider’s
conception of number is aﬀected only in so far as it implies, to a great
extent, the power of laying out a past in order to move towards a
future. It is this existential basis of intelligence which is aﬀected, much
more than intelligence itself, for, as we have shown,77 Schneider’s general intelligence is intact: his replies are slow, never meaningless, but
those of a mature, thinking man who takes an interest in the doctor’s
experiments. Beneath the intelligence as an anonymous function or as a
categorial process, a personal core has to be recognized, which is the
patient’s being, his power of existing. It is here that the illness has its
seat. Schneider would still like to arrive at political or religious opinions, but knows that it is useless to try. ‘He must now be content with
large-scale beliefs, without the power to express them.’78 He never
sings or whistles of his own accord.79 We shall see later that he never
takes any initiative sexually. He never goes out for a walk, but always on
an errand, and he never recognizes Professor Goldstein’s house as he
passes it ‘because he did not go out with the intention of going
there’.80 Just as he needs, by means of preparatory movements, to be
able to ‘take a grip’ on his own body before performing movements
when they are not mapped out ahead in a familiar situation,—so, a
conversation with another person does not constitute for him a situation signiﬁcant in itself, and requiring extempore replies. He can
speak only in accordance with a plan drawn up in advance: ‘He cannot
fall back on the inspiration of the moment in order to ﬁnd the ideas
required in response to a complex stage of the conversation, and this is

true whether it is a question of new or old points of view.’81 There is in
his whole conduct something meticulous and serious which derives
from the fact that he is incapable of play-acting. To act is to place
oneself for a moment in an imaginary situation, to ﬁnd satisfaction in
changing one’s ‘setting’. The patient, on the other hand, cannot enter
into a ﬁctitious situation without converting it into a real one: he
cannot tell the diﬀerence between a riddle and a problem.82 In his case,
the possible situation at every moment is so narrow that two sectors of
the environment not having anything in common for him cannot simultaneously form a situation.83 If one talks to him he cannot hear the
sound of another conversation in the next room; if a dish is brought
and placed on the table, he does not stop to wonder where the dish
comes from. He states that one can see only in the direction in which
one is looking, and only objects at which one is looking.84 Future and
past are for him only ‘shrunken’ extensions of the present. He has lost
‘our power of looking according to the temporal vector’.85 He cannot
take a bird’s eye view of his past and unhesitatingly rediscover it by
going from the whole to the parts: he rebuilds it, starting with a
fragment which has kept its meaning and which provides him with a
‘supporting-point’.86 Since he complains of the weather, he is asked if
he feels better in winter. He replies: ‘I can’t say now, I can’t say anything at the moment’.87 Thus all Schneider’s troubles are reducible to a
unity, but not the abstract unity of the ‘representative function’: he is
‘tied’ to actuality, he ‘lacks liberty’,88 that concrete liberty which comprises the general power of putting oneself into a situation. Beneath
intelligence as beneath perception, we discover a more fundamental
function, ‘a vector mobile in all directions like a searchlight, one
through which we can direct ourselves towards anything, in or outside
81

Benary, op. cit., p. 213.
In the same way there are for him no double meanings or puns because words have
only one meaning at a time, and because the actual is entirely without any horizon of
possibilities. Benary, op. cit., p. 283.

ourselves, and display a form of behaviour in relation to that object’.89
Yet the analogy of the searchlight is inadequate, since it presupposes
given objects on to which the beam plays, whereas the nuclear function
to which we refer, before bringing objects to our sight or knowledge,
makes them exist in a more intimate sense, for us. Let us therefore say
rather, borrowing a term from other works,90 that the life of
consciousness—cognitive life, the life of desire or perceptual life—is
subtended by an ‘intentional arc’ which projects round about us our
past, our future, our human setting, our physical, ideological and
moral situation, or rather which results in our being situated in all
these respects. It is this intentional arc which brings about the unity of
the senses, of intelligence, of sensibility and motility. And it is this
which ‘goes limp’ in illness.
The study of a pathological case, then, has enabled us to glimpse a
new mode of analysis—existential analysis—which goes beyond the
traditional alternatives of empiricism and rationalism, of explanation
and introspection. If consciousness were a collection of mental facts
each disturbance should be elective. If it were a ‘representative function’, a pure power of signiﬁcation, it could be or not be (and with it
everything else), but it could not cease to be having once been, or
become sick, that is, deteriorate. If, in short, it is a projective activity,
which leaves objects all round it, like traces of its own acts, but which
nevertheless uses them as springboards from which to leap towards
other spontaneous acts, then it becomes understandable that any ‘content’ deﬁciency should have its repercussions on the main body of
experience and open the door to its disintegration, that any pathological degeneration should aﬀect the whole of consciousness—and
that nevertheless the derangement should on each occasion attack a
certain ‘side’ of consciousness, that in each case certain symptoms
should dominate the clinical picture of the disease, and, in short, that
consciousness should be vulnerable and able to receive the illness into
itself. In attacking the ‘visual sphere’, illness is not limited to destroying
certain contents of consciousness, ‘visual representations’ or sight
literally speaking; it aﬀects sight in the ﬁgurative sense, of which the
former is no more than the model or symbol—the power of ‘looking

down upon’ (überschauen) simultaneous multiplicities,91 a certain way of
positing the object or being aware. However, as this type of consciousness is only the sublimation of sensory vision, as it is schematized
constantly within the dimensions of the visual ﬁeld, albeit endowing
them with a new meaning, it will be realized that this general function
has its psychological roots. Consciousness freely develops its visual data
beyond their own speciﬁc signiﬁcance; it uses them for the expression
of its spontaneous acts, as semantic evolution clearly shows in loading
the terms intuition, self-evidence and natural light with increasingly
rich meaning. But conversely, not one of these terms, in the ﬁnal sense
which history has given them, is understandable without reference to
the structures of visual perception. Hence one cannot say that man sees
because he is Mind, nor indeed that he is Mind because he sees: to see
as a man sees and to be Mind are synonymous. In so far as consciousness is consciousness of something only by allowing its furrow to trail
behind it, and in so far as, in order to conceive an object one must rely
on a previously constructed ‘world of thought’, there is always some
degree of depersonalization at the heart of consciousness. Hence the
principle of an intervention from outside: consciousness may be ailing,
the world of its thoughts may collapse into fragments,—or rather, as
the ‘contents’ dissociated by the illness did not appear in the rôle of
parts in normal consciousness and served only as stepping-stones to
signiﬁcances which outstrip them, consciousness can be seen trying to
hold up its superstructures when their foundations have given way,
aping its everyday processes, but without being able to come by any
intuitive realization, and without being able to conceal the particular
deﬁciency which robs them of their complete signiﬁcance. It is in the
same way theoretically understandable that mental illness may, in its
turn, be linked with some bodily accident; consciousness projects itself
into a physical world and has a body, as it projects itself into a cultural
world and has its habits: because it cannot be consciousness without
playing upon signiﬁcances given either in the absolute past of nature or
in its own personal past, and because any form of lived experience
tends towards a certain generality whether that of our habits or that of
our ‘bodily functions’.
These elucidations enable us clearly to understand motility as basic
91

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

intentionality. Consciousness is in the ﬁrst place not a matter of ‘I think
that’ but of ‘I can’.92 Schneider’s motor trouble cannot, any more than
his visual deﬁciency, be reduced to any failure of the general function
of representation. Sight and movement are speciﬁc ways of entering
into relationship with objects and if, through all these experiences,
some unique function ﬁnds its expression, it is the momentum of
existence, which does not cancel out the radical diversity of contents,
because it links them to each other, not by placing them all under the
control of an ‘I think’, but by guiding them towards the intersensory
unity of a ‘world’. Movement is not thought about movement, and
bodily space is not space thought of or represented. ‘Each voluntary
movement takes place in a setting, against a background which is
determined by the movement itself. . . . We perform our movements in
a space which is not “empty” or unrelated to them, but which on the
contrary, bears a highly determinate relation to them: movement and
background are, in fact, only artiﬁcially separated stages of a unique
totality.’93 In the action of the hand which is raised towards an object is
contained a reference to the object, not as an object represented, but as
that highly speciﬁc thing towards which we project ourselves, near
which we are, in anticipation, and which we haunt.94 Consciousness is

It is not easy to reveal pure motor intentionality: it is concealed behind the objective
world which it helps to build up. The history of apraxia would show how the description
of Praxis is almost always contaminated and ﬁnally made impossible by the notion of
representation. Liepmann (Über Störungen des Handelns bei Gehirnkranken) draws a clear distinction between apraxia and agnosic disturbances of conduct, in which the object is not
recognized, but in which, however, conduct is in harmony with the representation of the
object, and generally between apraxia and disturbances aﬀecting the ‘ideational preparation of action’ (forgetting the aim, confusing two aims, premature performance,
transfer of the aim through some intrusive perception) (op. cit., pp. 20–31). With Liepmann’s subject (the ‘counsellor of state’), the ideational process is normal, since the
subject can perform with his left hand everything that he is prevented from performing
with his right. Moreover, the hand is not paralysed. ‘The case of the counsellor of state
shows that between the so-called higher mental processes and motor nerve-impulses
there is room for another deﬁciency which prevents any application of the project
(Entwurf) for action to the motility of one particular limb . . . The whole sensory-motor
apparatus of a limb is so to speak dislocated (exarticuliert) in relation to the whole physiological process (ibid., pp. 40–1). Normally, then, every formula of movement, while
93

159

160 phenomenology of perception
being-towards-the-thing through the intermediary of the body. A
movement is learned when the body has understood it, that is, when it
has incorporated it into its ‘world’, and to move one’s body is to aim at
oﬀering us a representation, presents itself to our body as a speciﬁc practical possibility.
The patient has retained the formula of movement as a representation, but it no longer
conveys anything to his right hand, or at any rate his right hand has no longer any sphere
of action.’ ‘He has retained everything communicable in an action, everything objective
and perceptible in it for others. What he lacks, namely his capacity to move his right hand
according to a plan already mapped out, is something incommunicable and incapable of
being an object for an outside consciousness; it is a power, not a thing known (ein Können,
kein Kennen)’ (ibid., p. 47). But when Liepmann tries to make his analysis more explicit, he
returns to traditional views and dissects movement into a representation (the ‘formula of
movement’ which, along with the main goal provides me with intermediate aims) and a
system of automatisms (which, for each intermediate aim, brings appropriate nerve
impulses into play) (ibid., p. 59). The ‘power’ earlier mentioned becomes a ‘property of
the nervous substance’ (ibid., p. 47). This brings us back to the dualism of consciousness
and body which we thought we had left behind when we introduced the notion of
Bewegungsentwurf or motor project. If it is a question of a simple action, the representation
of the goal and of the intermediate aims is transformed into movement because it
releases involuntary actions acquired once and for all (p. 55). If it is a matter of complex
action, it calls up the ‘kinaesthetic memory of the component movements: as movement
is composed of partial acts, the project of movement is composed of the representation
of its parts or the intermediate aims: it is this representation that we have called the
formula of movement’ (p. 57). Praxis is torn asunder by representations and automatic
actions. The case of the counsellor of state becomes unintelligible, since it becomes
necessary to relate his troubles either to the ideational preliminaries to movement, or else
to some deﬁciency of the automatic actions, which Liepmann ruled out from the start. So
motor apraxia comes down either to ideational apraxia, which is a form of agnosia, or
else to paralysis. We shall make sense of apraxia and do justice to Liepmann’s observations only if the movement to be performed can be anticipated, though not by a representation. This is possible only provided that consciousness is understood not as the
explicit positing of its objects, but more generally as reference to a practical as well as a
theoretical object, as being-in-the-world, and if the body for its part is understood not as
one object among all objects, but as the vehicle of being in the world. As long as
consciousness is understood as representation, the only possible operation for it is to
form representations. Consciousness will be motor as long as it furnishes itself with a
‘representation of movement’. The body then executes the movement by copying it from
the representation which consciousness presents to itself, and in accordance with a
formula of movement which it receives from that representation. (Cf. O. Sittig, Über
Apraxie, p. 98.) We still need to understand by what magical process the representation of
a movement causes precisely that movement to be made by the body. The problem can
be solved only provided that we cease to draw a distinction between the body as a
mechanism in itself and consciousness as being for itself.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

things through it; it is to allow oneself to respond to their call, which is
made upon it independently of any representation. Motility, then, is
not, as it were, a handmaid of consciousness, transporting the body to
that point in space of which we have formed a representation beforehand. In order that we may be able to move our body towards an object,
the object must ﬁrst exist for it, our body must not belong to the realm
of the ‘in-itself’. Objects no longer exist for the arm of the apraxic, and
this is what causes it to remain immobile. Cases of pure apraxia in
which the perception of space remains unaﬀected, in which even the
‘intellectual notion of the gesture to be made’ does not appear to be
obscured, and yet in which the patient cannot copy a triangle;95 cases of
constructive apraxia, in which the subject shows no gnosic disturbance
except as regards the localization of stimuli on his body, and yet is
incapable of copying a cross, a v or an o,96 all prove that the body has its
world and that objects or space may be present to our knowledge but
not to our body.
We must therefore avoid saying that our body is in space, or in time. It
inhabits space and time. If my hand traces a complicated path through
the air, I do not need, in order to know its ﬁnal position, to add
together all movements made in the same direction and subtract those
made in the opposite direction. ‘Every identiﬁable change reaches consciousness already loaded with its relations to what has preceded it, as
on a taximeter the distance is given already converted into shillings and
pence.97 At every moment, previous attitudes and movements provide
an ever ready standard of measurement. It is not a question of a visual
or motor ‘memory’ of the starting position of the hand: cerebral
lesions may leave visual memory intact while destroying awareness of
movement. As for the ‘motor memory’, it is clear that it could hardly
establish the present position of the hand, unless the perception which
gave rise to it had not, stored up in it, an absolute awareness of ‘here’,
for without this we should be thrown back from memory to memory

and never have a present perception. Just as it is necessarily ‘here’, the
body necessarily exists ‘now’; it can never become ‘past’, and if we
cannot retain in health the living memory of sickness, or, in adult life
that of our body as a child, these ‘gaps in memory’ merely express the
temporal structure of our body. At each successive instant of a movement, the preceding instant is not lost sight of. It is, as it were, dovetailed into the present, and present perception generally speaking
consists in drawing together, on the basis of one’s present position, the
succession of previous positions, which envelop each other. But the
impending position is also covered by the present, and through it all
those which will occur throughout the movement. Each instant of the
movement embraces its whole span, and particularly the ﬁrst which,
being the active initiative, institutes the link between a here and a
yonder, a now and a future which the remainder of the instants will
merely develop. In so far as I have a body through which I act in the
world, space and time are not, for me, a collection of adjacent points
nor are they a limitless number of relations synthesized by my consciousness, and into which it draws my body. I am not in space and
time, nor do I conceive space and time; I belong to them, my body
combines with them and includes them. The scope of this inclusion is
the measure of that of my existence; but in any case it can never be allembracing. The space and time which I inhabit are always in their
diﬀerent ways indeterminate horizons which contain other points of
view. The synthesis of both time and space is a task that always has to be
performed afresh. Our bodily experience of movement is not a particular case of knowledge; it provides us with a way of access to the world
and the object, with a ‘praktognosia’,98 which has to be recognized as
original and perhaps as primary. My body has its world, or understands
its world, without having to make use of my ‘symbolic’ or ‘objectifying function’. Certain patients can imitate the doctor’s movements and
move their right hand to their right ear and their left to their nose, so
long as they stand beside the doctor and follow his movements
through a mirror, but not if they face him. Head explained the patient’s
failure in terms of the inadequacy of his ‘formulation’: according to

98

Grünbaum, Aphasie und Motorik.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

him the imitation of the action is dependent upon a verbal translation.
In fact, the formulation may be correct although the imitation is
unsuccessful, or again the imitation may be successful without any
formulation. Writes on the subject99 then introduce, if not exactly verbal symbolism, at least a general symbolic function, an ability to
‘transpose’, in which imitation, like perception or objective thought, is
merely a particular case. But it is obvious that this general function does
not explain adapted action. For patients are capable, not only of formulating the action to be performed, but of picturing it to themselves.
They are quite aware of what they have to do, and yet, instead of
moving the right hand to the right ear and the left hand to the nose,
they touch one ear with both hands, or else their nose and one eye, or
one ear and one eye.100 What has become impossible is the application
and adaptation to their own body of the objective particularity of the
action. In other words, the right and left hand, the eye and ear are still
presented to them as absolute locations, and not inserted into any
system of correlations which links them up with the corresponding
parts of the doctor’s body, and which makes them usable for imitation,
even when the doctor is face to face with the patient. In order to imitate
the actions of someone facing me, it is not necessary that I should
know expressly that ‘the hand which appears on the right side of my
visual ﬁeld is for my partner the left one’. Now it is precisely the victim
of disturbances who has recourse to these explanations. In normal
imitation, the subject’s left hand is immediately identiﬁed with his
partner’s, his action immediately models itself on the other’s, and the
subject projects himself or loses his separate reality in the other,
becomes identiﬁed with him, and the change of co-ordinates is preeminently embodied in this existential process. This is because the
normal subject has his body not only as a system of present positions,
but besides, and thereby, as an open system of an inﬁnite number of
equivalent positions directed to other ends. What we have called the
body image is precisely this system of equivalents, this immediately
given invariant whereby the diﬀerent motor tasks are instantaneously
transferable. It follows that it is not only an experience of my body, but
99
100

Goldstein, Van Woerkom, Bouman and Grünbaum.
Grünbaum, op, cit., pp. 386–92.

163

164 phenomenology of perception
an experience of my body-in-the-world, and that this is what gives a
motor meaning to verbal orders. The function destroyed in apraxic
disturbances is therefore a motor one. ‘It is not the symbolic or sensegiving function in general which is aﬀected in cases of this kind: it is a
much more primary function, in its nature motor, in other words, the
capacity for motor diﬀerentiation within the dynamic body image’.101
The space in which normal imitation operates is not, as opposed to
concrete space with its absolute locations, an ‘objective space’ or a
‘representative space’ based on an act of thought. It is already built into
my bodily structure, and is its inseparable correlative. ‘Already motility, in its pure state, possesses the basic power of giving a meaning
(Sinngebung)’.102 Even if subsequently, thought and the perception of
space are freed from motility and spatial being, for us to be able to
conceive space, it is in the ﬁrst place necessary that we should have
been thrust into it by our body, and that it should have provided us
with the ﬁrst model of those transpositions, equivalents and identiﬁcations which make space into an objective system and allow our
experience to be one of objects, opening out on an ‘in itself ’. ‘Motility
is the primary sphere in which initially the meaning of all signiﬁcances (der Sinn aller Signiﬁkationen) is engendered in the domain of represented space.’103
The acquisition of habit as a rearrangement and renewal of the
corporeal schema presents great diﬃculties to traditional philosophies,
which are always inclined to conceive synthesis as intellectual synthesis. It is quite true that what brings together, in habit, component
actions, reactions and ‘stimuli’ is not some external process of association.104 Any mechanistic theory runs up against the fact that the learning process is systematic; the subject does not weld together individual
movements and individual stimuli but acquires the power to respond
with a certain type of solution to situations of a certain general form.
The situations may diﬀer widely from case to case, and the response
movements may be entrusted sometimes to one operative organ,

sometimes to another, both situations and responses in the various
cases having in common not so much a partial identity of elements as a
shared meaning. Must we then see the origin of habit in an act of
understanding which organizes the elements only to withdraw subsequently?105 For example, is it not the case that forming the habit of
dancing is discovering, by analysis, the formula of the movement in
question, and then reconstructing it on the basis of the ideal outline by
the use of previously acquired movements, those of walking and running? But before the formula of the new dance can incorporate certain
elements of general motility, it must ﬁrst have had, as it were, the
stamp of movement set upon it. As has often been said, it is the body
which ‘catches’ (kapiert) and ‘comprehends’ movement. The acquisition of a habit is indeed the grasping of a signiﬁcance, but it is the
motor grasping of a motor signiﬁcance. Now what precisely does this
mean? A woman may, without any calculation, keep a safe distance
between the feather in her hat and things which might break it oﬀ. She
feels where the feather is just as we feel where our hand is.106 If I am in
the habit of driving a car, I enter a narrow opening and see that I can
‘get through’ without comparing the width of the opening with that of
the wings, just as I go through a doorway without checking the width
of the doorway against that of my body.107 The hat and the car have
ceased to be objects with a size and volume which is established by
comparison with other objects. They have become potentialities of
volume, the demand for a certain amount of free space. In the same
way the iron gate to the Underground platform, and the road, have
become restrictive potentialities and immediately appear passable or
impassable for my body with its adjuncts. The blind man’s stick has
ceased to be an object for him, and is no longer perceived for itself; its
point has become an area of sensitivity, extending the scope and active
radius of touch, and providing a parallel to sight. In the exploration of
things, the length of the stick does not enter expressly as a middle
term: the blind man is rather aware of it through the position of objects
105

As Bergson, for example, thinks when he deﬁnes habit as ‘the fossilized residue of a
spiritual activity’.

than of the position of objects through it. The position of things is
immediately given through the extent of the reach which carries him
to it, which comprises besides the arm’s own reach the stick’s range of
action. If I want to get used to a stick, I try it by touching a few things
with it, and eventually I have it ‘well in hand’, I can see what things are
‘within reach’ or out of reach of my stick. There is no question here of
any quick estimate or any comparison between the objective length of
the stick and the objective distance away of the goal to be reached. The
points in space do not stand out as objective positions in relation to the
objective position occupied by our body; they mark, in our vicinity,
the varying range of our aims and our gestures. To get used to a hat, a
car or a stick is to be transplanted into them, or conversely, to
incorporate them into the bulk of our own body. Habit expresses our
power of dilating our being-in-the-world, or changing our existence
by appropriating fresh instruments.108 It is possible to know how to
type without being able to say where the letters which make the words
are to be found on the banks of keys. To know how to type is not, then,
to know the place of each letter among the keys, nor even to have
acquired a conditioned reﬂex for each one, which is set in motion by
the letter as it comes before our eye. If habit is neither a form of
knowledge nor an involuntary action, what then is it? It is knowledge
in the hands, which is forthcoming only when bodily eﬀort is made,
and cannot be formulated in detachment from that eﬀort. The subject
knows where the letters are on the typewriter as we know where one
of our limbs is, through a knowledge bred of familiarity which does
not give us a position in objective space. The movement of
her ﬁngers is not presented to the typist as a path through space which
can be described, but merely as a certain adjustment of motility,
physiognomically distinguishable from any other. The question is
often framed as if the perception of a letter written on paper aroused
the representation of the same letter which in turn aroused the
representation of the movement needed to strike it on the machine. But
108

It thus elucidates the nature of the body image. When we say that it presents us
immediately with our bodily position, we do not mean, after the manner of empiricists,
that it consists of a mosaic of ‘extensive sensations’. It is a system which is open on to the
world, and correlative with it.

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

this is mythological language. When I run my eyes over the text set
before me, there do not occur perceptions which stir up representations, but patterns are formed as I look, and these are endowed with a
typical or familiar physiognomy. When I sit at my typewriter, a motor
space opens up beneath my hands, in which I am about to ‘play’ what I
have read. The reading of the word is a modulation of visible space, the
performance of the movement is a modulation of manual space, and
the whole question is how a cretin physiognomy of ‘visual’ patterns
can evoke a certain type of motor response, how each ‘visual’ structure
eventually provides itself with its mobile essence without there being
any need to spell the word or specify the movement in detail in order
to translate one into the other. But this power of habit is no diﬀerent
from the general one which we exercise over our body: if I am ordered
to touch my ear or my knee, I move my hand to my ear or my knee by
the shortest route, without having to think of the initial position of my
hand, or that of my ear, or the path between them. We said earlier that
it is the body which ‘understands’ in the acquisition of habit. This way
of putting it will appear absurd, if understanding is subsuming a sensedatum under an idea, and if the body is an object. But the phenomenon
of habit is just what prompts us to revise our notion of ‘understand’
and our notion of the body. To understand is to experience the harmony between what we aim at and what is given, between the intention and the performance—and the body is our anchorage in a world.
When I put my hand to my knee, I experience at every stage of the
movement the fulﬁlment of an intention which was not directed at my
knee as an idea or even as an object, but as a present and real part of my
living body, that is, ﬁnally, as a stage in my perpetual movement
towards a world. When the typist performs the necessary movements
on the typewriter, these movements are governed by an intention, but
the intention does not posit the keys as objective locations. It is literally
true that the subject who learns to type incorporates the key-bank
space into his bodily space.
The example of instrumentalists shows even better how habit has its
abode neither in thought nor in the objective body, but in the body as
mediator of a world. It is known109 that an experienced organist is
109

Cf. Chevalier, L’Habitude, pp. 202 and ﬀ.

167

168 phenomenology of perception
capable of playing an organ which he does not know, which has more
or fewer manuals, and stops diﬀerently arranged, compared with those
on the instrument he is used to playing. He needs only an hour’s
practice to be ready to perform his programme. Such a short preparation rules out the supposition that new conditioned reﬂexes have here
been substituted for the existing sets, except where both form a system
and the change is all-embracing, which takes us away from the mechanistic theory, since in that case the reactions are mediated by a
comprehensive grasp of the instrument. Are we to maintain that the
organist analyses the organ, that he conjures up and retains a representation of the stops, pedals and manuals and their relation to each other
in space? But during the short rehearsal preceding the concert, he does
not act like a person about to draw up a plan. He sits on the seat, works
the pedals, pulls out the stops, gets the measure of the instrument with
his body, incorporates within himself the relevant directions and
dimensions, settles into the organ as one settles into a house. He does
not learn objective spatial positions for each stop and pedal, nor does
he commit them to ‘memory’. During the rehearsal, as during the
performance, the stops, pedals and manuals are given to him as nothing more than possibilities of achieving certain emotional or musical
values, and their positions are simply the places through which this
value appears in the world. Between the musical essence of the piece as
it is shown in the score and the notes which actually sound round the
organ, so direct a relation is established that the organist’s body and his
instrument are merely the medium of this relationship. Henceforth the
music exists by itself and through it all the rest exists.110 There is here
no place for any ‘memory’ of the position of the stops, and it is not
in objective space that the organist in fact is playing. In reality his
movements during rehearsal are consecratory gestures: they draw
aﬀective vectors, discover emotional sources, and create a space of
expressiveness as the movements of the augur delimit the templum.
The whole problem of habit here is one of knowing how the musical
110

‘As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear.’ (Proust, Swann’s
Way, II, trans. C. K. Scott Moncrieﬀ, Chatto & Windus, p. 180.)
‘Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch
them as they came.’ (Ibid., p. 186.)

the spatiality of one’s own body and motility

signiﬁcance of an action can be concentrated in a certain place to the
extent that, in giving himself entirely to the music, the organist reaches
for precisely those stops and pedals which are to bring it into being.
Now the body is essentially an expressive space. If I want to take hold of
an object, already, at a point of space about which I have been quite
unmindful, this power of grasping constituted by my hand moves
upwards towards the thing. I move my legs not as things in space two
and a half feet from my head, but as a power of locomotion which
extends my motor intention downwards. The main areas of my body
are devoted to actions, and participate in their value, and asking why
common sense makes the head the seat of thought raises the same
problem as asking how the organist distributes, through ‘organ space’,
musical signiﬁcances. But our body is not merely one expressive space
among the rest, for that is simply the constituted body. It is the origin
of the rest, expressive movement itself, that which causes them to
begin to exist as things, under our hands and eyes. Although our body
does not impose deﬁnite instincts upon us from birth, as it does upon
animals, it does at least give to our life the form of generality, and
develops our personal acts into stable dispositional tendencies. In this
sense our nature is not long-established custom, since custom presupposes the form of passivity derived from nature. The body is our general medium for having a world. Sometimes it is restricted to the
actions necessary for the conservation of life, and accordingly it posits
around us a biological world; at other times, elaborating upon these
primary actions and moving from their literal to a ﬁgurative meaning,
it manifests through them a core of new signiﬁcance: this is true of
motor habits such as dancing. Sometimes, ﬁnally, the meaning aimed at
cannot be achieved by the body’s natural means; it must then build
itself an instrument, and it projects thereby around itself a cultural
world. At all levels it performs the same function which is to endow the
instantaneous expressions of spontaneity with ‘a little renewable action
and independent existence’.111 Habit is merely a form of this fundamental power. We say that the body has understood and habit has been
cultivated when it has absorbed a new meaning, and assimilated a fresh
core of signiﬁcance.

To sum up, what we have discovered through the study of motility, is
a new meaning of the word ‘meaning’. The great strength of intellectualist psychology and idealist philosophy comes from their having
no diﬃculty in showing that perception and thought have an intrinsic
signiﬁcance and cannot be explained in terms of the external association of fortuitously agglomerated contents. The Cogito was the coming
to self-awareness of this inner core. But all meaning was ipso facto conceived as an act of thought, as the work of a pure I, and although
rationalism easily refuted empiricism, it was itself unable to account
for the variety of experience, for the element of senselessness in it, for
the contingency of contents. Bodily experience forces us to acknowledge an imposition of meaning which is not the work of a universal
constituting consciousness, a meaning which clings to certain contents. My body is that meaningful core which behaves like a general
function, and which nevertheless exists, and is susceptible to disease. In
it we learn to know that union of essence and existence which we shall
ﬁnd again in perception generally, and which we shall then have to
describe more fully.

4
THE SYNTHESIS OF ONE’S
OWN BODY
The analysis of bodily space has led us to results which may be generalized. We notice for the ﬁrst time, with regard to our own body, what is
true of all perceived things: that the perception of space and the perception of the thing, the spatiality of the thing and its being as a thing
are not two distinct problems. The Cartesian and Kantian tradition
already teaches us this; it makes the object’s spatial limits its essence; it
shows in existence partes extra partes, and in spatial distribution, the only
possible signiﬁcance of existence in itself. But it elucidates the
perception of the object through the perception of space, whereas the
experience of our own body teaches us to embed space in existence.
Intellectualism clearly sees that the ‘motif of the thing’ and the ‘motif
of space’1 are interwoven, but reduces the former to the latter. Experience discloses beneath objective space, in which the body eventually
ﬁnds its place, a primitive spatiality of which experience is merely the
outer covering and which merges with the body’s very being. To be a
body, is to be tied to a certain world, as we have seen; our body is not
primarily in space: it is of it. Anosognosics who describe their arm as

1

Cassirer, Philosophie der symbolischen Formen, III, Second Part, Chap. II.

172 phenomenology of perception
‘like a snake’, long and cold,2 do not, strictly speaking, fail to recognize
its objective outline and, even when the patient looks unsuccessfully
for his arm or fastens it in order not to lose it,3 he knows well enough
where his arm is, since that is where he looks for it and fastens it. If,
however, patients experience their arm’s space as something alien, if
generally speaking I can feel my body’s space as vast or minute despite
the evidence of my senses, this is because there exists an aﬀective
presence and enlargement for which objective spatiality is not a sufﬁcient condition, as anosognosia shows, and indeed not even a necessary condition, as is shown by the phantom arm. Bodily spatiality is the
deployment of one’s bodily being, the way in which the body comes
into being as a body. In trying to analyse it, we were therefore simply
anticipating what we have to say about bodily synthesis in general.
We ﬁnd in the unity of the body the same implicatory structure as
we have already described in discussing space. The various parts of my
body, its visual, tactile and motor aspects are not simply co-ordinated.
If I am sitting at my table and I want to reach the telephone, the
movement of my hand towards it, the straightening of the upper part
of the body, the tautening of the leg muscles are enveloped in each
other. I desire a certain result and the relevant tasks are spontaneously
distributed amongst the appropriate segments, the possible combinations being presented in advance as equivalent: I can continue leaning
back in my chair provided that I stretch my arm further, or lean forward, or even partly stand up. All these movements are available to us in
virtue of their common meaning. That is why, in their ﬁrst attempts at
grasping, children look, not at their hand, but at the object: the various
parts of the body are known to us through their functional value only,
and their co-ordination is not learnt. Similarly, when I am sitting at my
table, I can instantly visualize the parts of my body which are hidden
from me. As I contract my foot in my shoe, I can see it. This power
belongs to me even with respect to parts of the body which I have
never seen. Thus certain patients have the hallucination of their own
face seen from inside.4 It has been possible to show that we do not

the synthesis of one’s own body

recognize our own hand in a photograph, and that many subjects are
even uncertain about identifying their own handwriting among others,
and yet that everyone recognizes his own silhouette or his own walk
when it is ﬁlmed. Thus we do not recognize the appearance of what we
have often seen, and on the other hand we immediately recognize the
visual representation of what is invisible to us in our own body.5 In
heautoscopy the double which the subject sees in front of him is not
always recognized by certain visible details, yet he feels convinced that
it is himself, and consequently declares that he sees his double.6 Each of
us sees himself as it were through an inner eye which from a few yards
away is looking at us from the head to the knees.7 Thus the connecting
link between the parts of our body and that between our visual and
tactile experience are not forged gradually and cumulatively. I do not
translate the ‘data of touch’ into the language of seeing’ or vice versa—I
do not bring together one by one the parts of my body; this translation
and this uniﬁcation are performed once and for all within me: they are
my body, itself. Are we then to say that we perceive our body in virtue
of its law of construction, as we know in advance all the possible facets
of a cube in virtue of its geometrical structure? But—to say nothing at
this stage about external objects—our own body acquaints us with a
species of unity which is not a matter of subsumption under a law. In
so far as it stands before me and presents its systematic variations to the
observer, the external object lends itself to a cursory mental examination of its elements and it may, at least by way of preliminary
approximation, be deﬁned in terms of the law of their variation. But I
am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather I am it. Neither its
variations nor their constant can, therefore, be expressly posited. We do
not merely behold as spectators the relations between the parts of our
body, and the correlations between the visual and tactile body: we are
ourselves the uniﬁer of these arms and legs, the person who both sees
and touches them. The body is, to use Leibnitz’s term, the ‘eﬀective
law’ of its changes. If we can still speak of interpretation in relation to
the perception of one’s own body, we shall have to say that it interprets

itself. Here the ‘visual data’ make their appearance only through the
sense of touch, tactile data through sight, each localized movement
against a background of some inclusive position, each bodily event,
whatever the ‘analyser’ which reveals it, against a background of signiﬁcance in which its remotest repercussions are at least foreshadowed
and the possibility of an intersensory parity immediately furnished.
What unites ‘tactile sensations’ in the hand and links them to visual
perceptions of the same hand, and to perceptions of other bodily areas,
is a certain style informing my manual gestures and implying in turn a
certain style of ﬁnger movements, and contributing, in the last resort,
to a certain bodily bearing.8 The body is to be compared, not to a
physical object, but rather to a work of art. In a picture or a piece of
music the idea is incommunicable by means other than the display of
colours and sounds. Any analysis of Cézanne’s work, if I have not seen
his pictures, leaves me with a choice between several possible
Cézannes, and it is the sight of the pictures which provides me with the
only existing Cézanne, and therein the analyses ﬁnd their full meaning.
The same is true of a poem or a novel, although they are made up of
words. It is well known that a poem, though it has a superﬁcial meaning translatable into prose, leads, in the reader’s mind, a further existence which makes it a poem. Just as the spoken word is signiﬁcant not
only through the medium of individual words, but also through that of
accent, intonation, gesture and facial expression, and as these additional meanings no longer reveal the speaker’s thoughts but the source
of his thoughts and his fundamental manner of being, so poetry,
which is perhaps accidentally narrative and in that way informative, is
essentially a variety of existence. It is distinguishable from the cry,
because the cry makes use of the body as nature gave it to us: poor in
expressive means; whereas the poem uses language, and even a particular language, in such a way that the existential modulation, instead of
being dissipated at the very instant of its expression, ﬁnds in poetic art
a means of making itself eternal. But although it is independent of the
gesture which is inseparable from living expression, the poem is not
independent of every material aid, and it would be irrecoverably lost if

distinctive positions and movements of my body. Cf. La Structure du Comportement, p. 196.

the synthesis of one’s own body

its text were not preserved down to the last detail. Its meaning is not
arbitrary and does not dwell in the ﬁrmament of ideas: it is locked in
the words printed on some perishable page. In that sense, like every
work of art, the poem exists as a thing and does not eternally survive as
does a truth. As for the novel, although its plot can be summarized and
the ‘thought’ of the writer lends itself to abstract expression, this conceptual signiﬁcance is extracted from a wider one, as the description of
a person is extracted from the actual appearance of his face. The novelist’s task is not to expound ideas or even analyse characters, but to
depict an inter-human event, ripening and bursting it upon us with no
ideological commentary, to such an extent that any change in the order
of the narrative or in choice of viewpoint would alter the literary meaning of the event. A novel, poem, picture or musical work are individuals, that is, beings in which the expression is indistinguishable
from the thing expressed, their meaning, accessible only through direct
contact, being radiated with no change of their temporal and spatial
situation. It is in this sense that our body is comparable to a work of art.
It is a nexus of living meanings, not the law for a certain number of
covariant terms. A certain tactile experience felt in the upper arm signiﬁes a certain tactile experience in the forearm and shoulder, along
with a certain visual aspect of the same arm, not because the various
tactile perceptions among themselves, or the tactile and visual ones, are
all involved in one intelligible arm, as the diﬀerent facets of a cube are
related to the idea of a cube, but because the arm seen and the arm
touched, like the diﬀerent segments of the arm, together perform one
and the same action.
Just as we saw earlier that motor habit threw light on the particular
nature of bodily space, so here habit in general enables us to understand the general synthesis of one’s own body. And, just as the analysis
of bodily spatiality foreshadowed that of the unity of one’s own body,
so we may extend to all habits what we have said about motor ones. In
fact every habit is both motor and perceptual, because it lies, as we have
said, between explicit perception and actual movement, in the basic
function which sets boundaries to our ﬁeld of vision and our ﬁeld of
action. Learning to ﬁnd one’s way among things with a stick, which we
gave a little earlier as an example of motor habit, is equally an example
of perceptual habit. Once the stick has become a familiar instrument,

175

176 phenomenology of perception
the world of feelable things recedes and now begins, not at the outer
skin of the hand, but at the end of the stick. One is tempted to say that
through the sensations produced by the pressure of the stick on the
hand, the blind man builds up the stick along with its various positions, and that the latter then mediate a second order object, the
external thing. It would appear in this case that perception is always a
reading oﬀ from the same sensory data, but constantly accelerated, and
operating with ever more attenuated signals. But habit does not consist in
interpreting the pressures of the stick on the hand as indications of
certain positions of the stick, and these as signs of an external object,
since it relieves us of the necessity of doing so. The pressures on the hand and
the stick are no longer given; the stick is no longer an object perceived
by the blind man, but an instrument with which he perceives. It is a
bodily auxiliary, an extension of the bodily synthesis. Correspondingly,
the external object is not the geometrized projection or invariant of a
set of perspectives, but something towards which the stick leads us and
the perspectives of which, according to perceptual evidence are not
signs, but aspects. Intellectualism cannot conceive any passage from the
perspective to the thing itself, or from sign to signiﬁcance otherwise
than as an interpretation, an apperception, a cognitive intention.
According to this view sensory data and perspectives are at each level
contents grasped as (aufgefasst als) manifestations of one and the same
intelligible core.9 But this analysis distorts both the sign and the meaning: it separates out, by a process of objectiﬁcation of both, the sensecontent, which is already ‘pregnant’ with a meaning, and the invariant
core, which is not a law but a thing; it conceals the organic relationship
between subject and world, the active transcendence of consciousness,
the momentum which carries it into a thing and into a world by means
of its organs and instruments. The analysis of motor habit as an extension of existence leads on, then, to an analysis of perceptual habit as the
coming into possession of a world. Conversely, every perceptual habit

Husserl, for example, for a long time deﬁned consciousness or the imposition of a
signiﬁcance in terms of the Auﬀassung-Inhalt framework, and as a beseelende Auﬀassung. He
takes a decisive step forward in recognizing, from the time of his Lectures on Time, that this
operation presupposes another deeper one whereby the content is itself made ready for
this apprehension. ‘Not every constitution is brought about through the AuﬀassungsinhaltAuﬀassung.’ Vorlesungen zur Phünomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins, p. 5, note 1.

the synthesis of one’s own body

is still a motor habit and here equally the process of grasping a meaning is performed by the body. When a child grows accustomed to
distinguishing blue from red, it is observed, that the habit cultivated in
relation to these two colours helps with the rest.10 Is it, then, the case
that through the pair blue-red the child has perceived the meaning;
‘colour’? Is the crucial moment of habit-formation in that coming to
awareness that arrival at a ‘point of view of colour’, that intellectual
analysis which subsumes the data under one category? But for the child
to be able to perceive blue and red under the category of colour, the
category must be rooted in the data, otherwise no subsumption could
recognize it in them. It is necessary that, on the ‘blue’ and ‘red’ panels
presented to him the particular kind of vibration and impression on the
eye known as blue and red should be represented. In the gaze we have
at our disposal a natural instrument analogous to the blind man’s stick.
The gaze gets more or less from things according to the way in which it
questions them, ranges over or dwells on them. To learn to see colours
it is to acquire a certain style of seeing, a new use of one’s own body: it
is to enrich and recast the body image. Whether a system of motor or
perceptual powers, our body is not an object for an ‘I think’, it is a
grouping of lived-through meanings which moves towards its equilibrium. Sometimes a new cluster of meanings is formed; our former
movements are integrated into a fresh motor entity, the ﬁrst visual data
into a fresh sensory entity, our natural powers suddenly come together
in a richer meaning, which hitherto has been merely foreshadowed in
our perceptual or practical ﬁeld, and which has made itself felt in our
experience by no more than a certain lack, and which by its coming
suddenly reshuﬄes the elements of our equilibrium and fulﬁls our
blind expectation.

5
THE BODY IN ITS
SEXUAL BEING
Our constant aim is to elucidate the primary function whereby we
bring into existence, for ourselves, or take a hold upon, space, the
object or the instrument, and to describe the body as the place where
this appropriation occurs. Now so long as we considered space or the
things perceived, it was not easy to rediscover the relationship between
the embodied subject and its world, because it is transformed by its
own activity into the intercourse between the epistemological subject
and the object. Indeed the natural world presents itself as existing in
itself over and above its existence for me; the act of transcendence
whereby the subject is thrown open to the world runs away with itself
and we ﬁnd ourselves in the presence of a nature which has no need to
be perceived in order to exist. If then we want to bring to light the
birth of being for us, we must ﬁnally look at that area of our experience
which clearly has signiﬁcance and reality only for us, and that is our
aﬀective life. Let us try to see how a thing or a being begins to exist for
us through desire or love and we shall thereby come to understand
better how things and beings can exist in general.
Ordinarily aﬀectivity is conceived as a mosaic of aﬀective states, of
pleasures and pains each sealed within itself, mutually incomprehensible, and explicable only in terms of the bodily system. If it is

the body in its sexual being

conceded that in man the emotional life is ‘shot through with intelligence’ we mean that simple representations can take the place of the
natural stimuli of pleasure and pain, according to the laws governing
the association of ideas or governing the conditioned reﬂex, that these
substitutions superimpose pleasure and pain on circumstances which
are, naturally speaking, matters of indiﬀerence to us and that, through
one displacement after another, second or third order values are created
which bear no obvious relation to our natural pleasures and pains. The
objective world plays less and less directly on the keyboard of ‘elementary’ aﬀective states, but their value remains nevertheless as a possibility of pleasure and pain. Apart from experience of pleasure and
pain, of which there is nothing to be said, the subject stands out by his
power of representation, and aﬀectivity is not recognized as a distinctive form of consciousness. If this conception were correct, any sexual
incapacity ought to amount either to the loss of certain representations
or else to a weakening of the capacity for satisfaction. We shall see that
this is not the case. One patient1 no longer seeks sexual intercourse of
his own accord. Obscene pictures, conversations on sexual topics, the
sight of a body do not arouse desire in him. The patient hardly ever
kisses, and the kiss for him has no value as sexual stimulation. Reactions are strictly local and do not begin to occur without contact. If the
prelude is interrupted at this stage, there is no attempt to pursue the
sexual cycle. In the sexual act intromission is never spontaneous. If
orgasm occurs ﬁrst in the partner and she moves away, the half-fulﬁlled
desire vanishes. At every stage it is as if the subject did not know what is
to be done. There are no active movements, save a few seconds before
the orgasm which is extremely brief. Nocturnal emissions are rare and
never accompanied by dreams. Are we to try to explain this sexual
inertia—as earlier we explained the loss of initiative in general
movements—in terms of the disappearance of visual representations?
The diﬃculty here is in maintaining that there is no tactile representation of sexual activity, and one is thus still left wondering why in
Schneider’s case touch stimulation, and not only visual perception, has

studied above, and whose emotional and sexual behaviour has been analysed by

180 phenomenology of perception
lost much of its sexual signiﬁcance. If now we work on the supposition
of some general failure of representation, both of touch and vision, the
problem still remains of describing the concrete aspect assumed by this
wholly formal deﬁciency in the realm of sexuality. For indeed the
infrequency of nocturnal emissions, for example, is not explained by
the weakness of representations, which are its eﬀect rather than its
cause, and which would seem to point to some change in the character
of the sexual life itself. If we presuppose some decline of normal sexual
reﬂexes or of pleasurable states, we are then faced with a case tending
rather to show that there are no sexual reﬂexes and no pure state of
pleasure. For, it will be recalled, all Schneider’s troubles spring from a
wound of limited extent in the occipital region. If sexuality in man
were an autonomous reﬂex apparatus, if the object of sexual desire
aﬀected some organ of pleasurable sensation anatomically deﬁned,
then the eﬀect of the cerebral injury would be to free these automatic
responses and take the form of accentuated sexual behaviour. Pathology
brings to light, somewhere between automatic response and representation, a vital zone in which the sexual possibilities of the patient are
elaborated, in the same way, as we saw above, as are his motor, perceptual and even intellectual possibilities. There must be, immanent in
sexual life, some function which ensures its emergence, and the normal extension of sexuality must rest on internal powers of the organic
subject. There must be an Eros or a Libido which breathes life into an
original world, gives sexual value or meaning to external stimuli and
outlines for each subject the use he shall make of his objective body. It
is the very structure of perception or erotic experience which has
undergone change in Schneider. In the case of the normal subject, a
body is not perceived merely as any object; this objective perception
has within it a more intimate perception: the visible body is subtended
by a sexual schema, which is strictly individual, emphasizing the
erogenous areas, outlining a sexual physiognomy, and eliciting the
gestures of the masculine body which is itself integrated into this
emotional totality. But for Schneider a woman’s body has no particular
essence: it is, he says, pre-eminently character which makes a woman
attractive, for physically they are all the same. Close physical contact
causes only a ‘vague feeling’, the knowledge of ‘an indeterminate
something’ which is never enough to ‘spark oﬀ ’ sexual behaviour and

the body in its sexual being

create a situation which requires a deﬁnite mode of resolution. Perception has lost its erotic structure, both spatially and temporally. What
has disappeared from the patient is his power of projecting before
himself a sexual world, of putting himself in an erotic situation, or,
once such a situation is stumbled upon, of maintaining it or following
it through to complete satisfaction. The very word satisfaction has no
longer any meaning for him, since there is no intention or initiative of
a sexual kind which calls up a cycle of movements and states, which
‘patterns’ them and ﬁnds its satisfaction in them. In so far as the tactile
stimuli themselves, which the patient turns to excellent account under
diﬀerent circumstances, have lost their sexual signiﬁcance, it is because
they have so to speak ceased to speak to his body, to locate it in a sexual
context, or, in other words, because the patient no longer asks, of his
environment, this mute and permanent question which constitutes
normal sexuality. Schneider, and the majority of impotent subjects, ‘do
not throw themselves into what they are doing’. But absentmindedness and inappropriate representations are not causes but
eﬀects, and in so far as the subject coolly perceives the situation, it is in
the ﬁrst place because he does not live it and is not caught up in it. At
this stage one begins to suspect a mode of perception distinct from
objective perception, a kind of signiﬁcance distinct from intellectual
signiﬁcance, an intentionality which is not pure ‘awareness of something’. Erotic perception is not a cogitatio which aims at a cogitatum;
through one body it aims at another body, and takes place in the world,
not in a consciousness. A sight has a sexual signiﬁcance for me, not
when I consider, even confusedly, its possible relationship to the sexual
organs or to pleasurable states, but when it exists for my body, for that
power always available for bringing together into an erotic situation the
stimuli applied, and adapting sexual conduct to it. There is an erotic
‘comprehension’ not of the order of understanding, since understanding subsumes an experience, once perceived, under some idea, while
desire comprehends blindly by linking body to body. Even in the case
of sexuality, which has nevertheless long been regarded as preeminently the type of bodily function, we are concerned, not with a
peripheral involuntary action, but with an intentionality which follows
the general ﬂow of existence and yields to its movements. Schneider
can no longer put himself into a sexual situation any more than

181

182 phenomenology of perception
generally he occupies an aﬀective or an ideological one. Faces are for
him neither attractive nor repulsive, and people appear to him in one
light or another only in so far as he has direct dealings with them, and
according to the attitude they adopt towards him, and the attention and
solicitude which they bestow upon him. Sun and rain are neither gay
nor sad; his humour is determined by elementary organic functions
only, and the world is emotionally neutral. Schneider hardly extends
his sphere of human relationships at all, and when he makes new
friendships they sometimes come to an unfortunate end: this is
because they never result, as can be seen on analysis, from a spontaneous impulse, but from a decision made in the abstract. He would
like to be able to think about politics and religion, but he does not even
try, knowing that these realms are closed to him, and we have seen that
generally speaking he never performs an act of authentic thought and
substitutes for the intuitive understanding of number or the grasp of
meanings the manipulation of signs and a technique depending on
‘points of support’.2 We discover both that sexual life is one more form
of original intentionality, and also bring to view the vital origins of
perception, motility and representation by basing all these ‘processes’
on an ‘intentional arc’ which gives way in the patient, and which, in
the normal subject, endows experience with its degree of vitality and
fruitfulness.
Thus sexuality is not an autonomous cycle. It has internal links with
the whole active and cognitive being, these three sectors of behaviour
displaying but a single typical structure, and standing in a relationship
to each other of reciprocal expression. Here we concur with the most
lasting discoveries of psychoanalysis. Whatever the theoretical declarations of Freud may have been, psychoanalytical research is in fact led to
an explanation of man, not in terms of his sexual substructure, but to a
discovery in sexuality of relations and attitudes which had previously
been held to reside in consciousness. Thus the signiﬁcance of psychoanalysis is less to make psychology biological than to discover a
dialectical process in functions thought of as ‘purely bodily’, and to reintegrate sexuality into the human being. A breakaway disciple of Freud3

the body in its sexual being

shows, for example, that frigidity is scarcely ever bound up with
anatomical or physiological conditions, but that it expresses in most
cases a refusal of orgasm, of femininity or of sexuality, and this in turn
expresses the rejection of the sexual partner and of the destiny which
he represents. It would be a mistake to imagine that even with Freud
psychoanalysis rules out the description of psychological motives, and
is opposed to the phenomenological method; psychoanalysis has, on
the contrary, albeit unwittingly, helped to develop it by declaring, as
Freud puts it, that every human action ‘has a meaning’,4 and by making
every eﬀort to understand the event, short of relating it to mechanical
circumstances.
For Freud himself the sexual is not the genital, sexual life is not a
mere eﬀect of the processes having their seat in the genital organs, the
libido is not an instinct, that is, an activity naturally directed towards
deﬁnite ends, it is the general power, which the psychosomatic subject enjoys, of taking root in diﬀerent settings, of establishing himself
through diﬀerent experiences, of gaining structures of conduct. It is
what causes a man to have a history. In so far as a man’s sexual history
provides a key to his life, it is because in his sexuality is projected his
manner of being towards the world, that is, towards time and other
men. There are sexual symptoms at the root of all neuroses, but these
symptoms, correctly interpreted, symbolize a whole attitude, whether,
for example, one of conquest or of ﬂight. Into the sexual history,
conceived as the elaboration of a general form of life, all psychological constituents can enter, because there is no longer an interaction of two causalities and because the genital life is geared to the
whole life of the subject. So the question is not so much whether
human life does or does not rest on sexuality, as of knowing what is
to be understood by sexuality. Psychoanalysis represents a double
trend of thought: on the one hand it stresses the sexual substructure
4

Freud, Introductory Lectures, p. 31. Freud himself, in his concrete analyses, abandons causal
thought, when he demonstrates that symptoms always have several meanings, or, as he
puts it, are ‘overdetermined’. For this amounts to admitting that a symptom, at the time
of its onset, always ﬁnds raisons d’être in the subject, so that no event in a life is, strictly
speaking, externally determined. Freud compares the accident occurring from outside to
the foreign body which, for the oyster, is merely the occasion for secreting a pearl. See for
example Cinq psychanalyses, Chap. I, p. 91, note 1.

184 phenomenology of perception
of life, on the other it ‘expands’ the notion of sexuality to the extent
of absorbing into it the whole of existence. But precisely for that
reason, its conclusions, like those of our last paragraph but one,
remain ambiguous. When we generalize the notion of sexuality, making it a manner of being in the physical and inter-human world, do
we mean, in the last analysis, that all existence has a sexual signiﬁcance or that every sexual phenomenon has an existential signiﬁcance? In the ﬁrst hypothesis, existence would be an abstraction,
another name for the sexual life. But since sexual life can no longer be
circumscribed, since it is no longer a separate function deﬁnable in
terms of the causality proper to a set of organs, there is now no sense
in saying that all existence is understood through the sexual life, or
rather this statement becomes a tautology. Must we then say, conversely, that the sexual phenomenon is merely an expression of our
general manner of projecting our setting? But the sexual life is not a
mere reﬂection of existence: an eﬀective life, in the political and ideological ﬁeld, for example, can be associated with impaired sexuality,
and may even beneﬁt from such impairment. On the other hand, the
sexual life may, as in Casanova’s case for example, possess a kind of
technical perfection corresponding to no particularly vigorous version
of being in the world. Even though the sexual apparatus has, running
through it, the general current of life, it may monopolize it to its own
advantage. Life is particularized into separate currents. If words are to
have any meaning, the sexual life is a sector of our life bearing a
special relation to the existence of sex. There can be no question of
allowing sexuality to become lost in existence, as if it were no more
then an epiphenomenon. For if we admit that the sexual troubles of
neurotics are an expression of their basic drama in magniﬁed form, it
still remains to be seen why the sexual expression of the drama is
more immature, more frequent and more striking than the rest; and
why sexuality is not only a symptom, but a highly important one.
Here we meet once more a problem which we have already
encountered several times. We showed with Gestalt theory that no
layer of sensory data can be identiﬁed as immediately dependent on
senseorgans: the smallest sensory datum is never presented in any
other way than integrated into a conﬁguration and already ‘patterned’.
This, as we have said, does not prevent the words ‘see’ and ‘hear’ from

the body in its sexual being

having a meaning. We have drawn attention elsewhere5 to the fact that
the specialized regions of the brain, the ‘optical zone’, for example,
never function in isolation. The fact remains, as we pointed out, that
the visual or auditory side predominates in the picture of the illness,
according to the region in which the lesions are situated. Finally, as
we have indicated above, biological existence is synchronized with
human existence and is never indiﬀerent to its distinctive rhythm.
Nevertheless, we shall now add, ‘living’ (leben) is a primary process
from which, as a starting point, it becomes possible to ‘live’ (erleben)
this or that world, and we must eat and breathe before perceiving and
awakening to relational living, belonging to colours and lights
through sight, to sounds through hearing, to the body of another
through sexuality, before arriving at the life of human relations. Thus
sight, hearing, sexuality, the body are not only the routes, instruments
or manifestations of personal existence: the latter takes up and absorbs
into itself their existence as it is anonymously given. When we say that
the life of the body, or the ﬂesh, and the life of the psyche are
involved in a relationship of reciprocal expression, or that the bodily
event always has a psychic meaning, these formulations need to be
explained. Valid as they are for excluding causal thought, they do not
mean that the body is the transparent integument of Spirit. The return
to existence, as to the setting in which the communication between
body and mind can be understood, is not a return to Consciousness or
Spirit, and existential psychoanalysis must not serve as a pretext for a
revival of mentalistic philosophy (spiritualisme). This will be better
understood if we clarify the notions of ‘expression’ and ‘meaning’
which belong to the world of language and thought as already
constituted, which we have just applied uncritically to the body-mind
relationship, and which bodily experience must in fact lead us to
correct.
A girl6 whose mother has forbidden her to see again the young man
with whom she is in love, cannot sleep, loses her appetite and ﬁnally
the use of speech. An initial manifestation of this loss of speech is
found to have occurred during her childhood, after an earthquake, and

subsequently again following a severe fright. A strictly Freudian interpretation of this would introduce a reference to the oral phase of sexual
development. But what is ‘ﬁxated’ on the mouth is not merely sexual
existence, but, more generally, those relations with others having the
spoken word as their vehicle. In so far as the emotion elects to ﬁnd its
expression in loss of speech, this is because of all bodily functions
speech is the most intimately linked with communal existence, or, as
we shall put it, with co-existence. Loss of speech, then, stands for the
refusal of co-existence, just as, in other subjects, a ﬁt of hysterics is the
means of escaping from the situation. The patient breaks with
relational life within the family circle. More generally, she tends to
break with life itself: her inability to swallow food arises from the fact
that swallowing symbolizes the movement of existence which carries
events and assimilates them; the patient is unable, literally, to ‘swallow’
the prohibition which has been imposed upon her.7 In the subject’s
childhood, fear was translated by loss of speech because the imminence of death violently interrupted co-existence, and threw her back
upon her own personal fate. The symptom of aphonia reappears
because the mother’s prohibition restores the situation metaphorically,
and because, moreover, by shutting oﬀ the future from the subject, it
leads her back to her favourite forms of behaviour. These motivations
may be supposed to take advantage of a particular sensitivity of the
throat and the mouth in the case of our subject, a sensitivity which may
be related to the history of her libido and to the oral phase of sexuality.
Thus though the sexual signiﬁcance of symptoms can be discerned, in
faint outline, their more general signiﬁcance in relation to past and
future, to the self and others, that is to say, to the fundamental dimensions of existence. But as we shall see, the body does not constantly
express the modalities of existence in the way that stripes indicate rank,
or a house-number a house: the sign here does not only convey its
signiﬁcance, it is ﬁlled with it; it is, in a way, what it signiﬁes, as a
portrait is the quasi-presence of the absent Peter,8 or as wax ﬁgures in
magic are what they stand for. The sick girl does not mime with her

body a drama played out ‘in her consciousness’. By losing her voice she
does not present a public version of an ‘inner state’, she does not make
a ‘gesture’ like that of the head of a state shaking hands with the engine
driver and embracing a peasant, or that of a friend who takes oﬀence
and stops speaking to me. To have lost one’s voice is not to keep silence:
one keeps silence only when one can speak. It is true that loss of voice
is not paralysis, and this is proved by the fact that, treated by psychological means and left free by her family to see the man she loves, the
girl recovers her power of speech. Yet neither is aphonia a deliberate or
voluntary silence. It is generally known how, by the notion of pithiatism,* the theory of hysteria has been carried beyond the dilemma of
paralysis (or of anasthesia) and simulation. If the hysterical patient is a
deceiver, it is ﬁrst and foremost himself that he deceives, so that it is
impossible to separate what he really feels or thinks and what he overtly
expresses: pithiatism is a disease of the Cogito, consciousness which has
become ambivalent and not a deliberate refusal to declare what one
knows. Here, in the same way, the girl does not cease to speak, she
‘loses’ her voice as one loses a memory. It is true again that, as psychoanalysis shows, the lost memory is not accidentally lost, it is lost rather
in so far as it belongs to an area of my life which I reject, in so far as it
has a certain signiﬁcance and, like all signiﬁcances, this one exists only
for someone. Forgetfulness is therefore an act; I keep the memory at
arm’s length, as I look past a person whom I do not wish to see. Yet, as
psychoanalysis too shows to perfection, though the resistance certainly
presupposes an intentional relationship with the memory resisted, it
does not set it before us as an object; it does not speciﬁcally reject the
memory. It is directed against a region of our experience, a certain
category, a certain class of memories. The subject who has left a book,
which was a present from his wife, in a drawer, and forgotten all about
it, and who rediscovers it when they have become reconciled once
more,9 had not really lost the book, but neither did he know where it
was. Everything connected with his wife had ceased to exist for him, he
had shut it out from his life, and at one stroke, broken the circuit of all

actions relating to her, and thus placed himself on the hither side of all
knowledge and ignorance, assertion and negation, in so far as these
were voluntary. Thus, in hysteria and repression, we may well overlook
something although we know of it, because our memories and our
body, instead of presenting themselves to us in singular and determinate conscious acts, are enveloped in generality. Through this generality
we still ‘have them’, but just enough to hold them at a distance from us.
We discover in this way that sensory messages or memories are
expressly grasped and recognized by us only in so far as they adhere
generally to that area of our body and our life to which they are
relevant. Such adherence or rejection places the subject in a deﬁnite
situation and sets bounds, as far as he is concerned, to the immediately
available mental ﬁeld, as the acquisition or loss of a sense organ presents to or removes from his direct grasp an object in the physical ﬁeld.
It cannot be said that the factual situation thus created is the mere
consciousness of a situation, for that would amount to saying that the
‘forgotten’ memory, arm or leg are arrayed before my consciousness,
present and near to me in the same sense as are the ‘preserved’ regions
of my past or of my body. No more can it be said that the loss of voice
is voluntary. Will presupposes a ﬁeld of possibilities among which I
choose: here is Peter, I can speak to him or not. But if I lose my power
of speech, Peter no longer exists for me as an interlocutor, sought after
or rejected; what collapses is the whole ﬁeld of possibilities. I cut
myself oﬀ even from that mode of communication and signiﬁcance
which silence provides. Of course we may go on to speak of hypocrisy
or bad faith. But then it will be necessary to draw a distinction between
psychological and metaphysical hypocrisy. The former deceives others
by concealing from them thoughts expressly in the mind of the subject.
It is fortuitous and easily avoided. The latter is self-deceiving through
the medium of generality, thus leading ﬁnally to a state or a situation
which is not an inevitability, but which is not posited or voluntary. It is
even to be found in the ‘sincere’ or ‘authentic’ man whenever he
undertakes to be something or other unqualiﬁedly. It is part of the
human lot. When the hysterical ﬁt has reached its climax, even if the
subject has sought it as the means of escaping from an intolerable
situation and plunges into it as into a place of refuge, he scarcely hears
anything more, he can scarcely see, he has almost become the spasmodic

the body in its sexual being

and panting existence which struggles on the bed. The intensity of
resentment is such that it becomes resentment against X, against life, an
absolute resentment. With every minute that passes, freedom is
depreciated and becomes less probable. Even if freedom is never
impossible and even if it may always derail the dialectics of bad faith,
the fact remains that a night’s sleep has the same power: what can be
surmounted by this anonymous force must indeed be of the same
nature as it, and so it must at least be admitted that resentment or loss
of voice, as they persist, become consistent like things, that they assume
a structure, and that any decision that interrupted them would come
from a lower level than that of ‘will’. The patient cuts himself oﬀ from
his voice as certain insects sever one of their own legs. He is literally
without a voice. In treating this condition, psychological medicine
does not act on the patient by making him know the origin of his illness:
sometimes a touch of the hand puts a stop to the spasms and restores to
the patient his speech10 and the same procedure, having acquired a
ritual signiﬁcance, will subsequently be enough to deal with fresh
attacks. In any case, in psychological treatment of any kind, the coming
to awareness would remain purely cognitive, the patient would not
accept the meaning of his disturbances as revealed to him without the
personal relationship formed with the doctor, or without the conﬁdence and friendship felt towards him, and the change of existence
resulting from this friendship. Neither symptom nor cure is worked
out at the level of objective or positing consciousness, but below that
level. Loss of voice as a situation may be compared to sleep: I lie down
in bed, on my left side, with my knees drawn up; I close my eyes and
breathe slowly, putting my plans out of my mind. But the power of my
will or consciousness stops there. As the faithful, in the Dionysian
mysteries, invoke the god by miming scenes from his life, I call up the
visitation of sleep by imitating the breathing and posture of the sleeper.
The god is actually there when the faithful can no longer distinguish
themselves from the part they are playing, when their body and their
consciousness cease to bring in, as an obstacle, their particular opacity,
and when they are totally fused in the myth. There is a moment when
sleep ‘comes’, settling on this imitation of itself which I have been

Binswanger, Über Psychotherapie, pp. 113 and ﬀ.

190 phenomenology of perception
oﬀering to it, and I succeed in becoming what I was trying to be: an
unseeing and almost unthinking mass, riveted to a point in space and
in the world henceforth only through the anonymous alertness of the
senses. It is true that this last link makes waking up a possibility:
through these half-open doors things will return or the sleeper will
come back into the world. In the same way the patient who has broken
with co-existence can still perceive the sensible integument of other
people, and abstractly conceive the future by means, for instance, of a
calendar. In this sense the sleeper is never completely isolated within
himself, never totally a sleeper, and the patient is never totally cut oﬀ
from the intersubjective world, never totally ill. But what, in the sleeper
and the patient, makes possible a return to the real world, are still only
impersonal functions, sense organs and language. We remain free in
relation to sleep and sickness to the exact extent to which we remain
always involved in the waking and healthy state, our freedom rests on
our being in a situation, and is itself a situation. Sleep and waking,
illness and health are not modalities of consciousness or will, but presuppose an ‘existential step’.11 Loss of voice does not merely represent
a refusal of speech, or anorexia a refusal of life; they are that refusal of
others or refusal of the future, torn from the transitive nature of ‘inner
phenomena’, generalized, consummated, transformed into de facto
situations.
The body’s rôle is to ensure this metamorphosis. It transforms ideas
into things, and my mimicry of sleep into real sleep. The body can
symbolize existence because it realizes it and is its actuality. It sustains
its dual existential action of systole and diastole. On the one hand,
indeed, it is the possibility enjoyed by my existence of discarding itself,
of making itself anonymous and passive, and of bogging itself down in
a scholastic. In the case of the girl just discussed, the move towards the
future, towards the living present or towards the past, the power of
learning, of maturing, of entering into communication with others,
have become, as it were, arrested in a bodily symptom, existence is tied
up and the body has become ‘the place where life hides away’.12 For the

patient, nothing further happens, nothing assumes meaning and form
in life, or more precisely there occurs only a recurrent and always
identical ‘now’, life ﬂows back on itself and history is dissolved in
natural time. Even when normal and even when involved in situations
with other people, the subject, in so far as he has a body, retains every
moment the power to withdraw from it. At the very moment when I
live in the world, when I am given over to my plans, my occupations,
my friends, my memories, I can close my eyes, lie down, listen to the
blood pulsating in my ears, lose myself in some pleasure or pain, and
shut myself up in this anonymous life which subtends my personal
one. But precisely because my body can shut itself oﬀ from the world,
it is also what opens me out upon the world and places me in a
situation there. The momentum of existence towards others, towards
the future, towards the world can be restored as a river unfreezes. The
girl will recover her voice, not by an intellectual eﬀort or by an abstract
decree of the will, but through a conversion in which the whole of her
body makes a concentrated eﬀort in the form of a genuine gesture, as
we seek and recover a name forgotten not ‘in our mind’, but ‘in our
head’ or ‘on the tip of our tongue’. The memory or the voice is
recovered when the body once more opens itself to others or to the
past, when it opens the way to co-existence and once more (in the
active sense) acquires signiﬁcance beyond itself. Moreover, even when
cut oﬀ from the circuit of existence, the body never quite falls back on
to itself. Even if I become absorbed in the experience of my body and in
the solitude of sensations, I do not succeed in abolishing all reference
of my life to a world. At every moment some intention springs afresh
from me, if it is only towards the things round about me which catch
my eye, or towards the instants, which are thrown up, and which
thrust back into the past what I have just lived through. I never become
quite a thing in the world; the density of existence as a thing always
evades me, my own substance slips away from me internally, and some
intention is always foreshadowed. In so far as it carries within it ‘sense
organs’, bodily existence is never self-suﬃcient, it is always a prey to an
active nothingness, it continually sets the prospect of living before me,
and natural time at every successive moment adumbrates the empty
form of the true event. This prospect may indeed fail to elicit any
response. The instant of natural time does not establish anything, it has

191

192 phenomenology of perception
to be immediately renewed, and indeed is renewed in another instant,
and the sensory functions by themselves do not cause me to be in the
world: when I become absorbed in my body, my eyes present me with
no more than the perceptible outer covering of things and of other
people, things themselves take on unreality, behaviour degenerates into
the absurd, and the present itself, as in cases of false recognition, loses
its consistency and takes on an air of eternity. Bodily existence which
runs through me, yet does so independently of me, is only the barest
raw material of a genuine presence in the world. Yet at least it provides
the possibility of such presence, and establishes our ﬁrst consonance
with the world. I may very well take myself away from the human
world and set aside personal existence, but only to rediscover in my
body the same power, this time unnamed, by which I am condemned
to being. It may be said that the body is ‘the hidden form of being
ourself’,13 or on the other hand, that personal existence is the taking up
and manifestation of a being in a given situation. If we therefore say
that the body expresses existence at every moment, this is in the sense
in which a word expresses thought. Anterior to conventional means of
expression, which reveal my thoughts to others only because already,
for both myself and them, meanings are provided for each sign, and
which in this sense do not give rise to genuine communication at all,
we must, as we shall see, recognize a primary process of signiﬁcation in
which the thing expressed does not exist apart from the expression,
and in which the signs themselves induce their signiﬁcance externally.
In this way the body expresses total existence, not because it is an
external accompaniment to that existence, but because existence realizes itself in the body. This incarnate signiﬁcance is the central phenomenon of which body and mind, sign and signiﬁcance are abstract
moments.
Understood in this way, the relation of expression to thing
expressed, or of sign to meaning is not a one-way relationship like that
between original text and translation. Neither body nor existence can be
regarded as the original of the human being, since they presuppose
each other, and because the body is solidiﬁed or generalized existence,
and existence a perpetual incarnation. What is particularly important,
13

Binswanger, Über Psychotherapie, ‘eine verdeckte Form unseres Selbstseins’ p. 188.

the body in its sexual being

is that when we say that sexuality has an existential signiﬁcance or that
it expresses existence, this is not to be understood as meaning that the
sexual drama14 is in the last analysis only a manifestation or a symptom
of an existential drama. The same reason that prevents us from
‘reducing’ existence to the body or to sexuality, prevents us also from
‘reducing’ sexuality to existence: the fact is that existence is not a set of
facts (like ‘psychic facts’) capable of being reduced to others or to
which they can reduce themselves, but the ambiguous setting of their
inter-communication, the point at which their boundaries run into
each other, or again their woven fabric. There is no question of making
human existence walk ‘on its head’. There is no doubt at all that we
must recognize in modesty, desire and love in general a metaphysical
signiﬁcance, which means that they are incomprehensible if man is
treated as a machine governed by natural laws, or even as ‘a bundle of
instincts’, and that they are relevant to man as a consciousness and as a
freedom. Usually man does not show his body, and, when he does, it is
either nervously or with an intention to fascinate. He has the impression that the alien gaze which runs over his body is stealing it from
him, or else, on the other hand, that the display of his body will deliver
the other person up to him, defenceless, and that in this case the other
will be reduced to servitude. Shame and immodesty, then, take their
place in a dialectic of the self and the other which is that of master and
slave: in so far as I have a body, I may be reduced to the status of an
object beneath the gaze of another person, and no longer count as a
person for him, or else I may become his master and, in my turn, look
at him. But this mastery is self-defeating, since, precisely when my value
is recognized through the other’s desire, he is no longer the person by
whom I wished to be recognized, but a being fascinated, deprived of
his freedom, and who therefore no longer counts in my eyes.
Saying that I have a body is thus a way of saying that I can be seen as
an object and that I try to be seen as a subject, that another can be my
master or my slave, so that shame and shamelessness express the dialectic of the plurality of consciousness, and have a metaphysical signiﬁcance. The same might be said of sexual desire: if it cannot accept the

presence of a third party as witness, if it feels that too natural an
attitude or over-casual remarks, on the part of the desired person, are
signs of hostility, this is because it seeks to fascinate, and because the
observing third party or the person desired, if he is too free in manner,
escapes this fascination. What we try to possess, then, is not just a body,
but a body brought to life by consciousness. As Alain says, one does not
love a madwoman, except in so far as one has loved her before the
onset of madness. The importance we attach to the body and the contradictions of love are, therefore, related to a more general drama
which arises from the metaphysical structure of my body, which is
both an object for others and a subject for myself. The intensity of
sexual pleasure would not be suﬃcient to explain the place occupied
by sexuality in human life or, for example, the phenomenon of eroticism, if sexual experience were not, as it were, an opportunity, vouchsafed to all and always available, of acquainting oneself with the human
lot in its most general aspects of autonomy and dependence. The
embarrassments and fears involved in human behaviour are not
explainable in terms of the sexual concern, since it contains them
already. On the other hand we do not reduce sexuality to something
other than itself by relating it to the ambiguity of the body. For, to
thought, the body as an object is not ambiguous; it becomes so only in
the experience which we have of it, and pre-eminently in sexual
experience, and through the fact of sexuality. To treat sexuality as a
dialectic is not to make a process of knowledge out of it, nor to identify
a man’s history with the history of his consciousness. The dialectic is
not a relationship between contradictory and inseparable thoughts; it is
the tending of an existence towards another existence which denies it,
and yet without which it is not sustained. Metaphysics—the coming to
light of something beyond nature—is not localized at the level of
knowledge: it begins with the opening out upon ‘another’, and is to
be found everywhere, and already, in the speciﬁc development of sexuality. It is true that, with Freud, we have generalized the notion of
sexuality. How can we then talk about a distinctive development
of sexuality? How can we identify a content of consciousness as sexual?
Indeed we cannot. Sexuality conceals itself from itself beneath a mask
of generality, and continually tries to escape from the tension and
drama which it sets up. But again, how are we justiﬁed in saying that it

the body in its sexual being

hides itself from itself, as if it were our life’s subject? Should we not
simply say that it is transcended and submerged in the more general
drama of existence? Here two mistakes are to be avoided: one is to fail
to recognize in existence any content other than its obvious one, which
is arranged in the form of distinct representations, as do philosophies
of consciousness; the other is to duplicate this obvious content with a
latent content, also consisting of representations, as do psychologies of
the unconscious. Sexuality is neither transcended in human life nor
shown up at its centre by unconscious representations. It is at all times
present there like an atmosphere. The dreamer does not ﬁrst visualize
the latent content of his dream, the one, that is, which is to be revealed
with the help of suitable images by the ‘second account’; he does not
ﬁrst openly perceive the stimuli of genital origin as being genital, only
subsequently translating the text into ﬁgurative language. For the
dreamer, indeed, who is far removed from the language of the waking
state, this or that genital excitation or sexual drive is without more ado
this image of a wall being climbed or cliﬀ-face being scaled, which are
seen as the obvious content. Sexuality becomes diﬀused in images
which derive from it only certain typical relationships, only a certain
general emotional physiognomy. The dreamer’s penis becomes the serpent which appears in the manifest content.15 What we have just said
about the dreamer applies equally to that ever slumbering part of ourselves which we feel to be anterior to our representations, to that
individual haze through which we perceive the world. There are here
blurred outlines, distinctive relationships which are in no way
‘unconscious’ and which, we are well aware, are ambiguous, having
reference to sexuality without speciﬁcally calling it to mind. From the
part of the body which it especially occupies, sexuality spreads forth
like an odour or like a sound. Here we encounter once more that
general function of unspoken transposition which we have already
recognized in the body during our investigation of the body image.
When I move my hand towards a thing, I know implicitly that my arm
unbends. When I move my eyes, I take account of their movement,
without being expressly conscious of the fact, and am thereby aware
that the upheaval caused in my ﬁeld of vision is only apparent. Similarly

195

196 phenomenology of perception
sexuality, without being the object of any intended act of consciousness, can underlie and guide speciﬁed forms of my experience. Taken
in this way, as an ambiguous atmosphere, sexuality is co-extensive
with life. In other words, ambiguity is of the essence of human existence, and everything we live or think has always several meanings. A
way of life—an attitude of escapism and need of solitude—is perhaps a
generalized expression of a certain state of sexuality. In thus becoming
transformed into existence, sexuality has taken upon itself so general a
signiﬁcance, the sexual theme has contrived to be for the subject the
occasion for so many accurate and true observations in themselves, of
so many rationally based decisions, and it has become so loaded with
the passage of time that it is an impossible undertaking to seek, within
the framework of sexuality, the explanation of the framework of existence. The fact remains that this existence is the act of taking up and
making explicit a sexual situation, and that in this way it has always at
least a double sense. There is interfusion between sexuality and existence, which means that existence permeates sexuality and vice versa, so
that it is impossible to determine, in a given decision or action, the
proportion of sexual to other motivations, impossible to label a decision or act ‘sexual’ or ‘non-sexual’. Thus there is in human existence a
principle of indeterminacy, and this indeterminacy is not only for us, it
does not stem from some imperfection of our knowledge, and we must
not imagine that any God could sound our hearts and minds and
determine what we owe to nature and what to freedom. Existence is
indeterminate in itself, by reason of its fundamental structure, and in so
far as it is the very process whereby the hitherto meaningless takes on
meaning, whereby what had merely a sexual signiﬁcance assumes a
more general one, chance is transformed into reason; in so far as it is
the act of taking up a de facto situation. We shall give the name ‘transcendence’ to this act in which existence takes up, to its own account,
and transforms such a situation. Precisely because it is transcendence,
existence never utterly outruns anything, for in that case the tension
which is essential to it would disappear. It never abandons itself. What
it is never remains external and accidental to it, since this is always
taken up and integrated into it. Sexuality therefore ought not, any more
than the body in general, to be regarded as a fortuitous content of our
experience. Existence has no fortuitous attributes, no content which

the body in its sexual being

does not contribute towards giving it its form; it does not give admittance to any pure fact because it is the process by which facts are drawn
up. It will perhaps be objected that the organization of our body is
contingent, that we can ‘conceive a man without hands, feet, head’16
and, a fortiori a sexless man, self-propagating by cutting or layering. But
this is the case only if we take an abstract view of hands, feet, head or
sexual apparatus, regarding them, that is, as fragments of matter, and
ignoring their living function. Only, indeed, if we form an abstract
notion of man in general, into which only the Cogitatio is allowed to
enter. If, on the other hand, we conceive man in terms of his experience, that is to say, of his distinctive way of patterning the world, and if
we reintegrate the ‘organs’ into the functional totality in which they
play their part, a handless or sexless man is as inconceivable as one
without the power of thought. It will be further objected that our
contention ceases to be paradoxical only at the price of becoming a
tautology: we are saying in eﬀect that a man would be diﬀerent from
what he is, and would therefore no longer be a man, if he were without
any of the relational systems which in fact he possesses. But, it will be
added, this arises from our conception of man as empirical man, as he
in fact exists, and from our relating, as through an essential necessity
and within the context of a human a priori, characteristics of this given
totality which have been brought together simply by the interplay of
multiple causes and the caprice of nature. In fact, we do not imagine,
through any backward-looking illusion, any essential necessity, we
point out an existential connection. Since, as we have shown above in
the examination of Schneider’s case, all human ‘functions’, from sexuality to motility and intelligence, are rigorously uniﬁed in one synthesis, it is impossible to distinguish in the total being of man a bodily
organization to be treated as a contingent fact, and other attributes
necessarily entering into his make-up. Everything in man is a necessity.
For example, it is no mere coincidence that the rational being is also
the one who holds himself upright or has a thumb which can be
brought opposite to the ﬁngers; the same manner of existing is evident
in both aspects.17 On the other hand everything in man is contingency

in the sense that this human manner of existence is not guaranteed to
every human child through some essence acquired at birth, and in the
sense that it must be constantly reforged in him through the hazards
encountered by the objective body. Man is a historical idea and not a
natural species. In other words, there is in human existence no
unconditioned possession, and yet no fortuitous attribute. Human
existence will force us to revise our usual notion of necessity and
contingency, because it is the transformation of contingency into
necessity by the act of taking in hand. All that we are, we are on the
basis of a de facto situation which we appropriate to ourselves and which
we ceaselessly transform by a sort of escape which is never an
unconditioned freedom. There is no explanation of sexuality which
reduces it to anything other than itself, for it is already something other
than itself, and indeed, if we like, our whole being. Sexuality, it is said,
is dramatic because we commit our whole personal life to it. But just why
do we do this? Why is our body, for us, the mirror of our being, unless
because it is a natural self, a current of given existence, with the result
that we never know whether the forces which bear us on are its or
ours—or with the result rather that they are never entirely either its or
ours. There is no outstripping of sexuality any more than there is any
sexuality enclosed within itself. No one is saved and no one is totally
lost.18

One can no more get rid of historical materialism than of psychoanalysis by impugning ‘reductionist’ conceptions and causal thought in the name of a descriptive and
phenomenological method, for historical materialism is no more linked to such ‘causal’
formulations as may have been given than is psycho-analysis, and like the latter it could
be expressed in another language. It consists just as much in making economics historical
as in making history economic. The economics on which it bases history is not, as in
classical economics, a closed cycle of objective phenomena, but a correlation of productive forces and forms of production, which is completed only when the former emerge
from their anonymity, become aware of themselves and are thus capable of imposing a
form on the future. Now, the coming to awareness is clearly a cultural phenomenon, and
through it all psychological motivations may ﬁnd their way into the web of history. A
‘materialist’ history of the 1917 Revolution does not consist of explaining each revolutionary thrust in terms of the retail price index at the moment in question, but of
putting it back in the class dynamism and interplay of psychological forces, which
ﬂuctuated between February and October, between the new proletarian power and the
old conservative power. Economics is reintegrated into history rather than history’s being
reduced to economics. ‘Historical materialism’, in the works inspired by it, is often

the body in its sexual being
nothing but a concrete conception of history which brings under consideration, besides
its obvious content (the oﬃcial relations between ‘citizens’ in a democracy, for instance)
its latent content, or the relations between human persons as they are actually established
in concrete living. When ‘materialist’ history identiﬁes democracy as a ‘formal’ régime,
and describes the conﬂicts with which such a régime is torn, the real subject of history,
which it is trying to extract from beneath the juridical abstraction called the citizen, is
not only the economic subject, man as a factor in production, but in more general terms
the living subject, man as creativity, as a person trying to endow his life with form,
loving, hating, creating or not creating works of art, having or not having children.
Historical materialism is not a causality exclusive to economics. One is tempted to say
that it does not base history and ways of thinking on production and ways of working,
but more generally on ways of existing and co-existing, on human relationships. It does
not bring the history of ideas down to economic history, but replaces these ideas in the
one history which they both express, and which is that of social existence. Solipsism as a
philosophical doctrine is not the result of a system of private property; nevertheless into
economic institutions as into conceptions of the world is projected the same existential
prejudice in favour of isolation and mistrust.
Yet this interpretation of historical materialism may appear ambiguous. We are
‘expanding’ the notion of economics as Freud expands that of sexuality; we are bringing
into it, besides the process of production and the struggle of economic forces against
economic forms, the constellation of psychological and moral motives which combine
to determine this struggle. But does not the word ‘economics’ thus lose all deﬁnite
meaning? If it is not that economic relations are expressed in the mode of Mitsein, is it not
the mode of Mitsein that is expressed in economic relations? When we relate both private
property and solipsism to a certain structure of Mitsein, are we not once more turning
history upside down? And must we not choose between the following two theses: either
the drama of co-existence has a purely economic signiﬁcance, or else the economic
drama is absorbed into a wider drama and has only an existential meaning, which brings
back mentalistic philosophy (spiritualisme).
It is precisely this dilemma, which the notion of existence, properly understood,
enables us to leave behind, and what we have said above about the existential conception
of ‘expression’ and ‘signiﬁcance’ must be reapplied here. An existential theory of history
is ambiguous, but this ambiguity cannot be made a matter of reproach, for it is inherent
in things. Only at the approach of revolution does history follow the lines dictated by
economics, and, as in the case of the individual life, sickness subjects a man to the vital
rhythm of his body, so in a revolutionary situation such as a general strike, factors
governing production come clearly to light, and are speciﬁcally seen as decisive. Even so
we have seen just now that the outcome depends on how the opposing forces think of
each other. It is all the more true, then, that during periods of depression, economic
factors are eﬀective only to the extent that they are lived and taken up by a human
subject, wrapped up, that is, in ideological shreds by a process amounting to selfdeception, or rather permanent equivocation, which is yet part of history and has a
weight of its own. Neither the conservative nor the proletarian is conscious of being
engaged in merely an economic struggle, and they always bring a human signiﬁcance to

199

200 phenomenology of perception
their action. In this sense there is never any pure economic causality, because economics
is not a closed system but is a part of the total and concrete existence of society. But an
existential conception of history does not deprive economic situations of their power of
motivation. If existence is the permanent act by which man takes up, for his own purposes,
and makes his own a certain de facto situation, none of his thoughts will be able to be quite
detached from the historical context in which he lives, and particularly from his economic situation. Precisely because economics is not a closed world, and because all
motivations intermingle at the core of history, the external becomes internal, and the
internal external, and no constituent of our existence can ever be outrun. It would be
ridiculous to regard Paul Valéry’s poetry as a mere episode of economic disturbance:
pure poetry can have an eternal meaning. But it is not ridiculous to seek, in the social and
economic drama, in the world of our Mitsein, the motive for this coming to awareness.
Just as all our life, as we have said, breathes a sexual atmosphere, without its being
possible to identify a single content of consciousness which is ‘purely sexual’ or which is
not sexual at all, so the economic and social drama provides each consciousness with a
certain background or even a certain imago which it sets about deciphering in its own way
and, in this sense, it is co-extensive with history. The act of the artist or philosopher is
free, but not motiveless. Their freedom resides in the power of equivocation of which we
spoke above, or in the process of escape discussed earlier; it consists in appropriating a de
facto situation by endowing it with a ﬁgurative meaning beyond its real one. Thus Marx,
not content to be the son of a lawyer and student of philosophy, conceives his own situation
as that of a ‘lower middle class intellectual’ in the new perspective of the class struggle.
Thus does Valéry transmute into pure poetry a disquiet and solitude of which others
would have made nothing. Thought is the life of human relationships as it understands
and interprets itself. In this voluntary act of carrying forward, this passing from objective
to subjective, it is impossible to say just where historical forces end and ours begin, and
strictly speaking the question is meaningless, since there is history only for a subject who
lives through it, and a subject only in so far as he is historically situated. There is no one
meaning of history; what we do has always several meanings, and this is where an
existential conception of history is distinguishable from materialism and from spiritualism. But every cultural phenomenon has, among others, an economic signiﬁcance, and
history by its nature never transcends, any more than it is reducible to, economics.
Conceptions of law, morality, religion and economic structure are involved in a network
of meanings within the Unity of the social event, as the parts of the body are mutually
implicatory within the Unity of the gesture, or as ‘physiological’, ‘psychological’ and
‘moral’ motives are linked in the Unity of an action. It is impossible to reduce the life
which involves human relationships either to economic relations, or to juridical and
moral ones thought up by men, just as it is impossible to reduce individual life either to
bodily functions or to our knowledge of life as it involves them. But in each case, one of
the orders of signiﬁcance can be regarded as dominant: one gesture as ‘sexual’, another
as ‘amorous’, another as ‘warlike’, and even in the sphere of co-existence, one period of
history can be seen as characterized by intellectual culture, another as primarily political
or economic. The question whether the history of our time is pre-eminently signiﬁcant
in an economic sense, and whether our ideologies give us only a derivative or secondary

the body in its sexual being
meaning of it is one which no longer belongs to philosophy, but to politics, and one
which will be solved only by seeking to know whether the economic or ideological
scenario ﬁts the facts more completely. Philosophy can only show that it is possible, starting
from the human condition.

THE BODY AS EXPRESSION,
AND SPEECH
We have seen in the body a unity distinct from that of the scientiﬁc
object. We have just discovered, even in its ‘sexual function’, intentionality and sense-giving powers. In trying to describe the phenomenon
of speech and the speciﬁc act of meaning, we shall have the opportunity to leave behind us, once and for all, the traditional subject-object
dichotomy.
The realization that speech is an originating realm naturally comes
late. Here as everywhere, the relation of having, which can be seen in the
very etymology of the word habit, is at ﬁrst concealed by relations
belonging to the domain of being, or, as we may equally say, by ontic
relations obtaining within the world.1 The possession of language is in
1

This distinction of having and being does not coincide with M. G. Marcel’s (Être et Avoir),
although not incompatible with it. M. Marcel takes having in the weak sense which the
word has when it designates a proprietary relationship (I have a house, I have a hat) and
immediately takes being in the existential sense of belonging to . . . , or taking up (I am
my body, I am my life). We prefer to take account of the usage which gives to the term
‘being’ the weak sense of existence as a thing, or that of predication (the table is, or is
big), and which reserves ‘having’ for the relation which the subject bears to the term
into which it projects itself (I have an idea, I have a desire, I have fears). Hence our
‘having’ corresponds roughly to M. Marcel’s being, and our being to his ‘having’.

the body as expression, and speech

the ﬁrst place understood as no more than the actual existence of
‘verbal images’, or traces left in us by words spoken or heard. Whether
these traces are physical, or whether they are imprinted on an
‘unconscious psychic life’, is of little importance, and in both cases the
conception of language is the same in that there is no ‘speaking subject’. Whether the stimuli, in accordance with the laws of neurological
mechanics, touch oﬀ excitations capable of bringing about the articulation of the word, or whether the states of consciousness cause, by
virtue of acquired associations, the appearance of the appropriate verbal image, in both cases speech occurs in a circuit of third person
phenomena. There is no speaker, there is a ﬂow of words set in motion
independently of any intention to speak. The meaning of words is
considered to be given with the stimuli or with the states of consciousness which it is simply a matter of naming; the shape of the word, as
heard or phonetically formed, is given with the cerebral or mental
tracks; speech is not an action and does not show up the internal
possibilities of the subject: man can speak as the electric lamp can
become incandescent. Since there are elective disturbances which
attack the spoken language to the exclusion of the written one, or vice
versa, and since language can disintegrate into fragments, we have to
conclude that it is built up by a set of independent contributions, and
that speech in the general sense is an entity of rational origin.
The theory of aphasia and of language seemed to be undergoing
complete transformation when it became necessary to distinguish,
over and above anarthria,* which aﬀects the articulation of the word,
true aphasia which is inseparable from disturbances aﬀecting
intelligence—and over and above automatic language, which is in
eﬀect a third person motor phenomenon, an intentional language
which is alone involved in the majority of cases of aphasia. The individuality of the ‘verbal image’ was, indeed, dissociated: what the
patient has lost, and what the normal person possesses, is not a certain
stock of words, but a certain way of using them. The same word which
remains at the disposal of the patient in the context of automatic languages escapes him in that of language unrelated to a purpose—the
patient who has no diﬃculty in ﬁnding the word ‘no’ in answer to the
* Anarthria: loss of power of articulate speech (Translator’s note).

203

204 phenomenology of perception
doctor’s questions, that is when he intends to furnish a denial arising
from his present experience, cannot do so when it is a question of an
exercise having no emotional and vital bearing. There is thus revealed,
underlying the word, an attitude, a function of speech which condition
it. The word could be identiﬁed as an instrument of action and as a
means of disinterested designation. Though ‘concrete’ language
remained a third person process, gratuitous language, or authentic
denomination, became a phenomenon of thought, and it is in some
disturbance of thinking that the origin of certain forms of aphasia must
be sought. For example, amnesia concerning names of colours, when
related to the general behaviour of the patient, appeared as a special
manifestation of a more general trouble. The same patients who cannot
name colours set before them, are equally incapable of classifying them
in the performance of a set task. If, for example, they are asked to sort
out samples according to basic colour, it is immediately noticed that
they do it more slowly and painstakingly than a normal subject: they
slowly place together the samples to be compared and fail to see at a
glance which ones ‘go together’. Moreover, having correctly assembled
several blue ribbons, they make unaccountable mistakes: if for example
the last blue ribbon was of a pale shade, they carry on by adding to the
collection of ‘blues’ a pale green or pale pink—as if it were beyond
them to stick to the proposed principle of classiﬁcation, and to consider the samples from the point of view of basic colour from start to
ﬁnish of the operation. They have thus become unable to subsume the
sensory givens under a category, to see immediately the samples as
representatives of the eidos blue. Even when, at the beginning of the test,
they proceed correctly, it is not the conformity of the samples to an
idea which guides them, but the experience of an immediate resemblance, and hence it comes about that they can classify the samples only
when they have placed them side by side. The sorting test brings to
light in these subjects a fundamental disorder, of which forgetting
names of colours is simply another manifestation. For to name a thing
is to tear oneself away from its individual and unique characteristics to
see it as representative of an essence or a category, and the fact that the
patient cannot identify the samples is a sign, not that he has lost the
verbal image of the words red or blue, but that he has lost the general
ability to subsume a sensory given under a category, that he has lapsed

the body as expression, and speech

back from the categorial to the concrete attitude.2 These analyses and
other similar ones lead us, it would seem, to the antithesis of the theory
of the verbal image, since language now appears as conditioned by
thought.
In fact we shall once again see that there is a kinship between the
empiricist or mechanistic psychologies and the intellectualist ones, and
the problem of language is not solved by going from one extreme to
the other. A short time ago the reproduction of the word, the revival of
the verbal image, was the essential thing. Now it is no more than what
envelops true denomination and authentic speech, which is an inner
process. And yet these two conceptions are at one in holding that the
word has no signiﬁcance. In the ﬁrst case this is obvious since the word
is not summoned up through the medium of any concept, and since
the given stimuli or ‘states of mind’ call it up in accordance with the
laws of neurological mechanics or those of association, and that thus
the word is not the bearer of its own meaning, has no inner power, and
is merely a psychic, physiological or even physical phenomenon set
alongside others, and thrown up by the working of an objective causality.
It is just the same when we duplicate denomination with a categorial
operation. The word is still bereft of any eﬀectiveness of its own, this
time because it is only the external sign of an internal recognition,
which could take place without it, and to which it makes no contribution. It is not without meaning, since behind it there is a categorial
operation, but this meaning is something which it does not have, does
not possess, since it is thought which has a meaning, the word remaining an empty container. It is merely a phenomenon of articulation, of
sound, or the consciousness of such a phenomenon, but in any case
language is but an external accompaniment of thought. In the ﬁrst case,
we are on this side of the word as meaningful; in the second we are
beyond it. In the ﬁrst there is nobody to speak; in the second, there is
certainly a subject, but a thinking one, not a speaking one. As far as
speech itself is concerned, intellectualism is hardly any diﬀerent from
empiricism, and is no better able than the latter to dispense with an
explanation in terms of involuntary action. Once the categorial operation is performed, the appearance of the word which completes the

205

206 phenomenology of perception
process still has to be explained, and this will still be done by recourse
to a physiological or psychic mechanism, since the word is a passive
shell. Thus we refute both intellectualism and empiricism by simply
saying that the word has a meaning.
If speech presupposed thought, if talking were primarily a matter of
meeting the object through a cognitive intention or through a representation, we could not understand why thought tends towards expression as towards its completion, why the most familiar thing appears
indeterminate as long as we have not recalled its name, why the thinking subject himself is in a kind of ignorance of his thoughts so long as
he has not formulated them for himself, or even spoken and written
them, as is shown by the example of so many writers who begin a
book without knowing exactly what they are going to put into it. A
thought limited to existing for itself, independently of the constraints
of speech and communication, would no sooner appear than it would
sink into the unconscious, which means that it would not exist even for
itself. To Kant’s celebrated question, we can reply that it is indeed part
of the experience of thinking, in the sense that we present our thought
to ourselves through internal or external speech. It does indeed move
forward with the instant and, as it were, in ﬂashes, but we are then left
to lay hands on it, and it is through expression that we make it our
own. The denomination of objects does not follow upon recognition;
it is itself recognition. When I ﬁx my eyes on an object in the half-light,
and say: ‘It is a brush’, there is not in my mind the concept of a brush,
under which I subsume the object, and which moreover is linked by
frequent association with the word ‘brush’, but the word bears the
meaning, and, by imposing it on the object, I am conscious of reaching
that object. As has often been said,3 for the child the thing is not known
until it is named, the name is the essence of the thing and resides in it
on the same footing as its colour and its form. For pre-scientiﬁc thinking, naming an object is causing it to exist or changing it: God creates
beings by naming them and magic operates upon them by speaking of
them. These ‘mistakes’ would be unexplainable if speech rested on the
concept, for the latter ought always to know itself as distinct from the
former, and to know the former as an external accompaniment. If it is
3

the body as expression, and speech

pointed out in reply that the child learns to know objects through the
designations of language, that thus, given in the ﬁrst place as linguistic
entities, objects receive only secondarily their natural existence, and
that ﬁnally the actual existence of a linguistic community accounts for
childish beliefs, this explanation leaves the problem untouched, since,
if the child can know himself as a member of a linguistic community
before knowing himself as thinking about some Nature, it is conditional upon the subject’s being able to overlook himself as universal
thought and apprehend himself as speech, and on the fact that the
word, far from being the mere sign of objects and meanings, inhabits
things and is the vehicle of meanings. Thus speech, in the speaker, does
not translate ready-made thought, but accomplishes it.4 A fortiori must it
be recognized that the listener receives thought from speech itself. At
ﬁrst sight, it might appear that speech heard can bring him nothing: it
is he who gives to words and sentences their meaning, and the very
combination of words and sentences is not an alien import, since it
would not be understood if it did not encounter in the listener the
ability spontaneously to eﬀect it. Here, as everywhere, it seems at ﬁrst
sight true that consciousness can ﬁnd in its experience only what it has
itself put there. Thus the experience of communication would appear
to be an illusion. A consciousness constructs—for x—that linguistic
mechanism which will provide another consciousness with the chance
of having the same thoughts, but nothing really passes between them.
Yet, the problem being how, to all appearances, consciousness learns
something, the solution cannot consist in saying that it knows everything in advance. The fact is that we have the power to understand over
and above what we may have spontaneously thought. People can speak
to us only a language which we already understand, each word of a
diﬃcult text awakens in us thoughts which were ours beforehand, but
these meanings sometimes combine to form new thought which
recasts them all, and we are transported to the heart of the matter, we
ﬁnd the source. Here there is nothing comparable to the solution of a
problem, where we discover cover an unknown quantity through its

There is, of course, every reason to distinguish between an authentic speech, which
formulates for the ﬁrst time, and second-order expression, speech about speech, which
makes up the general run of empirical language. Only the ﬁrst is identical with thought.

relationship with known ones. For the problem can be solved only if it
is determinate, that is, if the cross-checking of the data provides the
unknown quantity with one or more deﬁnite values. In understanding
others, the problem is always indeterminate5 because only the solution
will bring the data retrospectively to light as convergent, only the
central theme of a philosophy, once understood, endows the philosopher’s writings with the value of adequate signs. There is, then, a
taking up of others’ thought through speech, a reﬂection in others, an
ability to think according to others6 which enriches our own thoughts.
Here the meaning of words must be ﬁnally induced by the words
themselves, or more exactly, their conceptual meaning must be formed
by a kind of deduction from a gestural meaning, which is immanent in
speech. And as, in a foreign country, I begin to understand the meaning of words through their place in a context of action, and by taking
part in a communal life—in the same way an as yet imperfectly understood piece of philosophical writing discloses to me at least a certain
‘style’—either a Spinozist, critical or phenomenological one—which
is the ﬁrst draft of its meaning. I begin to understand a philosophy by
feeling my way into its existential manner, by reproducing the tone and
accent of the philosopher. In fact, every language conveys its own
teaching and carries its meaning into the listener’s mind. A school of
music or painting which is at ﬁrst not understood, eventually, by its
own action, creates its own public, if it really says something; that is, it
does so by secreting its own meaning. In the case of prose or poetry,
the power of the spoken word is less obvious, because we have the
illusion of already possessing within ourselves, in the shape of the
common property meaning of words, what is required for the understanding of any text whatsoever. The obvious fact is, however, that the
colours of the palette or the crude sounds of instruments, as presented
to us in natural perception, are insuﬃcient to provide the musical sense
of music, or the pictorial sense of a painting. But, in fact, it is less the
case that the sense of a literary work is provided by the common
5
Again, what we say here applies only to ﬁrst-hand speech—that of the child uttering its
ﬁrst word, of the lover revealing his feelings, of the ‘ﬁrst man who spoke’, or of the
writer and philosopher who reawaken primordial experience anterior to all traditions.

property meaning of words, than that it contributes to changing that
accepted meaning. There is thus, either in the man who listens or reads,
or in the one who speaks or writes, a thought in speech the existence of
which is unsuspected by intellectualism.
To realize this, we must turn back to the phenomenon of speech and
put into question the usual accounts which immobilize thought and
speech, and make anything other than external relations between them
inconceivable. We must recognize ﬁrst of all that thought, in the speaking subject, is not a representation, that is, that it does not expressly
posit objects or relations. The orator does not think before speaking,
nor even while speaking; his speech is his thought. In the same way the
listener does not form concepts on the basis of signs. The orator’s
‘thought’ is empty while he is speaking and, when a text is read to us,
provided that it is read with expression, we have no thought marginal
to the text itself, for the words fully occupy our mind and exactly fulﬁl
our expectations, and we feel the necessity of the speech. Although we
are unable to predict its course, we are possessed by it. The end of the
speech or text will be the lifting of a spell. It is at this stage that
thoughts on the speech or text will be able to arise. Previously the
speech was improvised and the text understood without the intervention of a single thought; the sense was everywhere present, and
nowhere posited for its own sake. The speaking subject does not think
of the sense of what he is saying, nor does he visualize the words which
he is using. To know a word or a language is, as we have said, not to be
able to bring into play any pre-established nervous network. But neither is it to retain some ‘pure recollection’ of the word, some faded
perception. The Bergsonian dualism of habit-memory and pure recollection does not account for the near-presence of the words I know:
they are behind me, like things behind my back, or like the city’s
horizon round my house, I reckon with them or rely on them, but
without having any ‘verbal image’. In so far as they persist within me, it
is rather as does the Freudian Imago which is much less the representation of a former perception than a highly speciﬁc emotional essence,
which is yet generalized, and detached from its empirical origins.
What remains to me of the word once learnt is its style as constituted
by its formation and sound. What we have said earlier about the ‘representation of movement’ must be repeated concerning the verbal image:

209

210 phenomenology of perception
I do not need to visualize external space and my own body in order to
move one within the other. It is enough that they exist for me, and that
they form a certain ﬁeld of action spread around me. In the same way I
do not need to visualize the word in order to know and pronounce it. It
is enough that I possess its articulatory and acoustic style as one of the
modulations, one of the possible uses of my body. I reach back for the
word as my hand reaches towards the part of my body which is being
pricked; the word has a certain location in my linguistic world, and is
part of my equipment. I have only one means of representing it, which
is uttering it, just as the artist has only one means of representing the
work on which he is engaged: by doing it. When I imagine Peter
absent, I am not aware of contemplating an image of Peter numerically
distinct from Peter himself. However far away he is, I visualize him in
the world, and my power of imagining is nothing but the persistence
of my world around me.7 To say that I imagine Peter is to say that I
bring about the pseudo-presence of Peter by putting into operation the
‘Peter-behaviour-pattern’. Just as Peter in imagination is only one of
the modalities of my being in the world, so the verbal image is only
one of the modalities of my phonetic gesticulation, presented with
many others in the all-embracing consciousness of my body. This is
obviously what Bergson means when he talks about a ‘motor framework’ of recollection, but if pure representations of the past take their
place in this framework, it is not clear why they should need it to
become actual once more. The part played by the body in memory is
comprehensible only if memory is, not only the constituting consciousness of the past, but an eﬀort to reopen time on the basis of the
implications contained in the present, and if the body, as our permanent means of ‘taking up attitudes’ and thus constructing pseudopresents, is the medium of our communication with time as well as
with space.8 The body’s function in remembering is that same function
7

Sartre, L’Imagination, p. 148.
‘. . . when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to
discover where I was, everything would be moving round me through the darkness,
things, places, years. My body, still too heavy with sleep to move, would make an eﬀort
to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orientation of its various members, so
as to induce from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together and to
give a name to the house in which it must be living. Its memory, the composite memory

of projection which we have already met in starting to move: the body
converts a certain motor essence into vocal form, spreads out the
articulatory style of a word into audible phenomena, and arrays the
former attitude, which is resumed, into the panorama of the past,
projecting an intention to move into actual movement, because the
body is a power of natural expression.
These considerations enable us to restore to the act of speaking its
true physiognomy. In the ﬁrst place speech is not the ‘sign’ of thought,
if by this we understand a phenomenon which heralds another as
smoke betrays ﬁre. Speech and thought would admit of this external
relation only if they were both thematically given, whereas in fact they
are intervolved, the sense being held within the word, and the word
being the external existence of the sense. Nor can we concede, as is
commonly done, that speech is a mere means of ﬁxation, nor yet that it
is the envelope and clothing of thought. Why should it be easier to
recall words or phrases than thoughts, if the alleged verbal images need
to be reconstructed on every occasion? And why should thought seek
to duplicate itself or clothe itself in a succession of utterances, if the
latter do not carry and contain within themselves their own meaning?
Words cannot be ‘strongholds of thought’, nor can thought seek
expression, unless words are in themselves a comprehensible text, and
unless speech possesses a power of signiﬁcance entirely its own. The
word and speech must somehow cease to be a way of designating
things or thoughts, and become the presence of that thought in the
phenomenal world, and, moreover, not its clothing but its token or its
body. There must be, as psychologists say, a ‘linguistic concept’ (Sprachbegriﬀ)9 or a word concept (Wortbegriﬀ), a ‘central inner experience,
of its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades oﬀered it a whole series of rooms in which it had
at one time or another slept; while the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves
to the shape of each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the
darkness. . . . My body, the side upon which I was lying, loyally preserving from the past
an impression which my mind should never have forgotten, brought back before my eyes
the glimmering ﬂame of the night-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn
and hung by chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Sienna marble in my
bedroom at Combray, in my great-aunt’s house, in those far-distant days which, at the
moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly deﬁned.’ (Proust, Swann’s Way,
I, trans. C. K. Scott Moncrieﬀ, Chatto and Windus, pp. 5–6.)

speciﬁcally verbal, thanks to which the sound, heard, uttered, read or
written, becomes a linguistic fact’.10 Certain patients can read a text,
‘putting expression into it’, without, however, understanding it. This is
because the spoken or written words carry a top coating of meaning
which sticks to them and which presents the thought as a style, an
aﬀective value, a piece of existential mimicry, rather than as a conceptual statement. We ﬁnd here, beneath the conceptual meaning of
the words, an existential meaning which is not only rendered by them,
but which inhabits them, and is inseparable from them. The greatest
service done by expression is not to commit to writing ideas which
might be lost. A writer hardly ever re-reads his own works, and great
works leave in us at a ﬁrst reading all that we shall ever subsequently get
out of them. The process of expression, when it is successful, does not
merely leave for the reader and the writer himself a kind of reminder, it
brings the meaning into existence as a thing at the very heart of the
text, it brings it to life in an organism of words, establishing it in the
writer or the reader as a new sense organ, opening a new ﬁeld or a new
dimension to our experience. This power of expression is well known
in the arts, for example in music. The musical meaning of a sonata is
inseparable from the sounds which are its vehicle: before we have
heard it no analysis enables us to anticipate it; once the performance is
over, we shall, in our intellectual analyses of the music, be unable to do
anything but carry ourselves back to the moment of experiencing it.
During the performance, the notes are not only the ‘signs’ of the
sonata, but it is there through them, it enters into them.11 In the same
way the actress becomes invisible, and it is Phaedra who appears. The
meaning swallows up the signs, and Phaedra has so completely taken
possession of Berma that her passion as Phaedra appears the apotheosis
of ease and naturalness.12 Aesthetic expression confers on what it
expresses an existence in itself, installs it in nature as a thing perceived
and accessible to all, or conversely plucks the signs themselves—the
person of the actor, or the colours and canvas of the painter—from
their empirical existence and bears them oﬀ into another world. No

one will deny that here the process of expression brings the meaning
into being or makes it eﬀective, and does not merely translate it. It is no
diﬀerent, despite what may appear to be the case, with the expression
of thoughts in speech. Thought is no ‘internal’ thing, and does not
exist independently of the world and of words. What misleads us in
this connection, and causes us to believe in a thought which exists for
itself prior to expression, is thought already constituted and expressed,
which we can silently recall to ourselves, and through which we
acquire the illusion of an inner life. But in reality this supposed silence
is alive with words, this inner life is an inner language. ‘Pure’ thought
reduces itself to a certain void of consciousness, to a momentary desire.
The new sense-giving intention knows itself only by donning already
available meanings, the outcome of previous acts of expression. The
available meanings suddenly link up in accordance with an unknown
law, and once and for all a fresh cultural entity has taken on an existence. Thought and expression, then, are simultaneously constituted,
when our cultural store is put at the service of this unknown law, as our
body suddenly lends itself to some new gesture in the formation of
habit. The spoken word is a genuine gesture, and it contains its meaning in the same way as the gesture contains its. This is what makes
communication possible. In order that I may understand the words of
another person, it is clear that his vocabulary and syntax must be
‘already known’ to me. But that does not mean that words do their
work by arousing in me ‘representations’ associated with them, and
which in aggregate eventually reproduce in me the original ‘representation’ of the speaker. What I communicate with primarily is not
‘representations’ or thought, but a speaking subject, with a certain style
of being and with the ‘world’ at which he directs his aim. Just as the
sense-giving intention which has set in motion the other person’s
speech is not an explicit thought, but a certain lack which is asking to
be made good, so my taking up of this intention is not a process of
thinking on my part, but a synchronizing change of my own existence,
a transformation of my being. We live in a world where speech is an
institution. For all these many commonplace utterances, we possess
within ourselves ready-made meanings. They arouse in us only second
order thoughts; these in turn are translated into other words which
demand from us no real eﬀort of expression and will demand from our

213

214 phenomenology of perception
hearers no eﬀort of comprehension. Thus language and the understanding of language apparently raise no problems. The linguistic and
intersubjective world no longer surprises us, we no longer distinguish
it from the world itself, and it is within a world already spoken and
speaking that we think. We become unaware of the contingent element
in expression and communication, whether it be in the child learning
to speak, or in the writer saying and thinking something for the ﬁrst
time, in short, in all who transform a certain kind of silence into
speech. It is, however, quite clear that constituted speech, as it operates
in daily life, assumes that the decisive step of expression has been taken.
Our view of man will remain superﬁcial so long as we fail to go back to
that origin, so long as we fail to ﬁnd, beneath the chatter of words, the
primordial silence, and as long as we do not describe the action which
breaks this silence. The spoken word is a gesture, and its meaning, a
world.
Modern psychology13 has demonstrated that the spectator does not
look about within himself among his closest experiences for the meaning of the gestures which he is witnessing. Faced with an angry or
threatening gesture, I have no need, in order to understand it, to recall
the feelings which I myself experienced when I used these gestures on
my own account. I know very little, from inside, of the mime of anger
so that a decisive factor is missing for any association by resemblance
or reasoning by analogy, and what is more, I do not see anger or a
threatening attitude as a psychic fact hidden behind the gesture, I read
anger in it. The gesture does not make me think of anger, it is anger itself.
However, the meaning of the gesture is not perceived as the colour of
the carpet, for example, is perceived. If it were given to me as a thing, it
is not clear why my understanding of gestures should for the most part
be conﬁned to human ones. I do not ‘understand’ the sexual pantomime of the dog, still less of the cockchafer or the praying mantis. I do
not even understand the expression of the emotions in primitive
people or in circles too unlike the ones in which I move. If a child
happens to witness sexual intercourse, it may understand it without the
experience of desire and of the bodily attitudes which translate it, but
the sexual scene will be merely an untoward and disturbing spectacle,
13

For example, M. Scheler, Nature et Formes de la Sympathie, pp. 347 and ﬀ.

the body as expression, and speech

without meaning unless the child has reached the stage of sexual
maturity at which this behaviour becomes possible for it. It is true that
often knowledge of other people lights up the way to self-knowledge:
the spectacle outside him reveals to the child the meaning of its own
impulses, by providing them with an aim. But the instance would pass
unnoticed if it did not coincide with the inner possibilities of the child.
The sense of the gestures is not given, but understood, that is,
recaptured by an act on the spectator’s part. The whole diﬃculty is to
conceive this act clearly without confusing it with a cognitive operation. The communication or comprehension of gestures comes about
through the reciprocity of my intentions and the gestures of others, of
my gestures and intentions discernible in the conduct of other people.
It is as if the other person’s intention inhabited my body and mine his.
The gesture which I witness outlines an intentional object. This object
is genuinely present and fully comprehended when the powers of my
body adjust themselves to it and overlap it. The gesture presents itself to
me as a question, bringing certain perceptible bits of the world to my
notice, and inviting my concurrence in them. Communication is
achieved when my conduct identiﬁes this path with its own. There is
mutual conﬁrmation between myself and others. Here we must
rehabilitate the experience of others which has been distorted by intellectualist analyses, as we shall have to rehabilitate the perceptual
experience of the thing. When I perceive a thing, a ﬁreplace for
example, it is not the concordance of its various aspects which leads
me to believe in the existence of the ﬁreplace as the geometrized projection and collective signiﬁcance of all these perspectives. On the contrary I perceive the thing in its own self-evident completeness and this
is what gives me the assurance that, in the course of perceptual experience, I shall be presented with an indeﬁnite set of concordant views.
The identity of the thing through perceptual experience is only another
aspect of the identity of one’s own body throughout exploratory
movements; thus they are the same in kind as each other. Like the body
image, the ﬁreplace is a system of equivalents not founded on the
recognition of some law, but on the experience of a bodily presence. I
become involved in things with my body, they co-exist with me as an
incarnate subject, and this life among things has nothing in common
with the elaboration of scientiﬁcally conceived objects. In the same

215

216 phenomenology of perception
way, I do not understand the gestures of others by some act of intellectual interpretation; communication between consciousnesses is not
based on the common meaning of their respective experiences, for it is
equally the basis of that meaning. The act by which I lend myself to the
spectacle must be recognized as irreducible to anything else. I join it in
a kind of blind recognition which precedes the intellectual working
out and clariﬁcation of the meaning. Successive generations ‘understand’ and perform sexual gestures, such as the caress, before the philosopher14 makes its intellectual signiﬁcance clear, which is that we lock
within itself a passive body, enwrap it in a pleasurable lethargy, thus
imposing a temporary respite upon the continual drive which projects
it into things and towards others. It is through my body that I understand other people, just as it is through my body that I perceive
‘things’. The meaning of a gesture thus ‘understood’ is not behind it, it
is intermingled with the structure of the world outlined by the gesture,
and which I take up on my own account. It is arrayed all over
the gesture itself—as, in perceptual experience, the signiﬁcance of the
ﬁreplace does not lie beyond the perceptible spectacle, namely the ﬁreplace itself as my eyes and movements discover it in the world.
The linguistic gesture, like all the rest, delineates its own meaning.
This idea seems surprising at ﬁrst, yet one is forced to accept it if one
wishes to understand the origin of language, always an insistent problem, although psychologists and linguistics scholars both question its
validity in the name of positive knowledge. It seems at ﬁrst impossible
to concede to either words or gestures an immanent meaning, because
the gesture is limited to showing a certain relationship between man
and the perceptible world, because this world is presented to the spectator by natural perception, and because in this way the intentional
object is oﬀered to the spectator at the same time as the gesture itself.
Verbal ‘gesticulation’, on the other hand, aims at a mental setting
which is not given to everybody, and which it is its task to communicate. But here what nature does not provide, cultural background does.
Available meanings, in other words former acts of expression, establish
between speaking subjects a common world, to which the words being
actually uttered in their novelty refer as does the gesture to the
14

Here J. P. Sartre, L’Être et le Néant, pp. 453 and ﬀ.

the body as expression, and speech

perceptible world. And the meaning of speech is nothing other than
the way in which it handles this linguistic world or in which it plays
modulations on the keyboard of acquired meanings. I seize it in an
undivided act which is as short as a cry. It is true that the problem has
been merely shifted one stage further back: how did the available
meanings themselves come to be constituted? Once language is
formed, it is conceivable that speech may have meaning, like the gesture, against the mental background held in common. But do syntactical forms and vocabulary, which are here presupposed, carry their
meaning within themselves? One can see what there is in common
between the gesture and its meaning, for example in the case of emotional expression and the emotions themselves: the smile, the relaxed
face, gaiety of gesture really have in them the rhythm of action, the
mode of being in the world which are joy itself. On the other hand, is
not the link between the verbal sign and its meaning quite accidental, a
fact demonstrated by the existence of a number of languages? And was
not the communication of the elements of language between the ‘ﬁrst
man to speak’ and the second necessarily of an entirely diﬀerent kind
from communication through gesture? This is what is commonly
expressed by saying that gesture or emotional pantomime are ‘natural
signs’, and the word a ‘natural convention’. But conventions are a late
form of relationship between men; they presuppose an earlier means of
communication, and language must be put back into this current of
intercourse. If we consider only the conceptual and delimiting meaning of words, it is true that the verbal form—with the exception of
endings—appears arbitrary. But it would no longer appear so if we
took into account the emotional content of the word, which we have
called above its ‘gestural’ sense, which is all-important in poetry, for
example. It would then be found that the words, vowels and phonemes
are so many ways of ‘singing’ the world, and that their function is to
represent things not, as the naïve onomatopoeic theory had it, by
reason of an objective resemblance, but because they extract, and
literally express, their emotional essence. If it were possible, in any
vocabulary, to disregard what is attributable to the mechanical laws of
phonetics, to the inﬂuences of other languages, the rationalization of
grammarians, and assimilatory processes, we should probably discover
in the original form of each language a somewhat restricted system of

217

218 phenomenology of perception
expression, but such as would make it not entirely arbitrary, if we
designate night by the word ‘nuit’, to use ‘lumière’ for light. The
predominance of vowels in one language, or of consonants in another,
and constructional and syntactical systems, do not represent so many
arbitrary conventions for the expression of one and the same idea, but
several ways for the human body to sing the world’s praises and in the
last resort to live it. Hence the full meaning of a language is never
translatable into another. We may speak several languages, but one of
them always remains the one in which we live. In order completely to
assimilate a language, it would be necessary to make the world which it
expresses one’s own, and one never does belong to two worlds at
once.15 If there is such a thing as universal thought, it is achieved by
taking up the eﬀort towards expression and communication in one
single language, and accepting all its ambiguities, all the suggestions
and overtones of meaning of which a linguistic tradition is made up,
and which are the exact measure of its power of expression. A conventional algorithm—which moreover is meaningful only in relation
to language—will never express anything but nature without man.
Strictly speaking, therefore, there are no conventional signs, standing as
the simple notation of a though: pure and clear in itself, there are only
words into which the history of a whole language is compressed, and
which eﬀect communication with no absolute guarantee, dogged as
they are by incredible linguistic hazards. We think that language is
more transparent than music because most of the time we remain
within the bounds of constituted language, we provide ourselves with
15

‘In my case, the eﬀort for these years to live in the dress of Arabs, and to imitate their
mental foundation, quitted me of my English self, and let me look at the West and its
conventions with new eyes: they destroyed it all for me. At the same time I could not
sincerely take on the Arab skin: it was an aﬀectation only. Easily was a man made an
inﬁdel, but hardly might he be converted to another faith. I had dropped one form and
not taken on the other, and was become like Mohammed’s coﬃn in our legend. . . . Such
detachment came at times to a man exhausted by prolonged physical eﬀort and isolation.
His body pledded on mechanically, while his reasonable mind left him, and from without looked down critically on him, wondering what that futile lumber did and why.
Sometimes these selves would converse in the void; and then madness was very near, as I
believe it would be near the man who could see things through the veils at once of two
customs, two educations, two environments.’ T. E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,
Jonathan Cape, pp. 31–2.

the body as expression, and speech

available meanings, and in our deﬁnitions we are content, like the
dictionary, to explain meanings in terms of each other. The meaning of
a sentence appears intelligible throughout, detachable from the sentence and ﬁnitely self-subsistent in an intelligible world, because we
presuppose as given all those exchanges, owed to the history of the
language, which contribute to determining its sense. In music, on the
other hand, no vocabulary is presupposed, the meaning appears as
linked to the empirical presence of the sounds, and that is why music
strikes us as dumb. But in fact, as we have said, the clearness of language stands out from an obscure background, and if we carry our
research far enough we shall eventually ﬁnd that language is equally
uncommunicative of anything other than itself, that its meaning is
inseparable from it. We need, then, to seek the ﬁrst attempts at language in the emotional gesticulation whereby man superimposes on
the given world the world according to man. There is here nothing
resembling the famous naturalistic conceptions which equate the artiﬁcial sign with the natural one, and try to reduce language to emotional expression. The artiﬁcial sign is not reducible to the natural one,
because in man there is no natural sign, and in assimilating language to
emotional expressions, we leave untouched its speciﬁc quality, if it is
true that emotion, viewed as a variation of our being in the world, is
contingent in relation to the mechanical resources contained in our
body, and shows the same power of giving shape to stimuli and situations which is at its most striking at the level of language. It would be
legitimate to speak of ‘natural signs’ only if the anatomical organization of our body produced a correspondence between speciﬁc gestures
and given ‘states of mind’. The fact is that the behaviour associated
with anger or love is not the same in a Japanese and an Occidental. Or,
to be more precise, the diﬀerence of behaviour corresponds to a diﬀerence in the emotions themselves. It is not only the gesture which is
contingent in relation to the body’s organization, it is the manner itself
in which we meet the situation and live it. The angry Japanese smiles,
the westerner goes red and stamps his foot or else goes pale and hisses
his words. It is not enough for two conscious subjects to have the same
organs and nervous system for the same emotions to produce in both
the same signs. What is important is how they use their bodies,
the simultaneous patterning of body and world in emotion. The

219

220 phenomenology of perception
psychophysiological equipment leaves a great variety of possibilities
open, and there is no more here than in the realm of instinct a human
nature ﬁnally and immutably given. The use a man is to make of his
body is transcendent in relation to that body as a mere biological entity.
It is no more natural, and no less conventional, to shout in anger or to
kiss in love16 than to call a table ‘a table’. Feelings and passional conduct
are invented like words. Even those which, like paternity, seem to be
part and parcel of the human make-up are in reality institutions.17 It is
impossible to superimpose on man a lower layer of behaviour which
one chooses to call ‘natural’, followed by a manufactured cultural or
spiritual world. Everything is both manufactured and natural in man, as
it were, in the sense that there is not a word, not a form of behaviour
which does not owe something to purely biological being—and which
at the same time does not elude the simplicity of animal life, and cause
forms of vital behaviour to deviate from their pre-ordained direction,
through a sort of leakage and through a genius for ambiguity which
might serve to deﬁne man. Already the mere presence of a living being
transforms the physical world, bringing to view here ‘food’, there a
‘hiding place’, and giving to ‘stimuli’ a sense which they have not
hitherto possessed. A fortiori does this apply to the presence of a man in
the animal world. Behaviour creates meanings which are transcendent
in relation to the anatomical apparatus, and yet immanent to the
behaviour as such, since it communicates itself and is understood. It is
impossible to draw up an inventory of this irrational power which
creates meanings and conveys them. Speech is merely one particular
case of it.
What is true, however—and justiﬁes the view that we ordinarily take
of language, as being in a peculiar category—is that, alone of all
expressive processes, speech is able to settle into a sediment and constitute an acquisition for use in human relationships. This fact cannot be
explained by pointing out that speech can be recorded on paper,

whereas gestures or forms of behaviour are transmitted only by direct
imitation. For music too can be written down, and, although there is in
music something in the nature of an initiation into the tradition,
although, that is, it would probably be impossible to graduate to atonal
music without passing through classical music, yet every composer
starts his task at the beginning, having a new world to deliver, whereas
in the realm of speech, each writer is conscious of taking as his objective the same world as has already been dealt with by other writers. The
worlds of Balzac and Stendhal are not like planets without communication with each other, for speech implants the idea of truth in us as the
presumptive limit of its eﬀort. It loses sight of itself as a contingent fact,
and takes to resting upon itself; this is, as we have seen, what provides
us with the ideal of thought without words, whereas the idea of music
without sounds is ridiculous. Even if this is pushing the principle
beyond its limits and reducing things to the absurd, even if a linguistic
meaning can never be delivered of its inherence in some word or other,
the fact remains that the expressive process in the case of speech can be
indeﬁnitely reiterated, that it is possible to speak about speech whereas
it is impossible to paint about painting, and ﬁnally that every philosopher has dreamed of a form of discourse which would supersede all
others, whereas the painter or the musician does not hope to exhaust
all possible painting or music. Thus there is a privileged position
accorded to Reason. But if we want to understand it clearly, we must
begin by putting thought back among the phenomena of expression.
This conception of language carries further the best and most recent
analysis of aphasia, of which we have so far made use of only a part. We
have seen, to start with, that after an empiricist phase, the theory of
aphasia, since Pierre Marie, seemed to move over to intellectualism,
and that, in linguistic disturbances, it invoked the ‘representative function’ (Darstellungsfunktion) or ‘categorial’ activity18 and that it based
speech on thought. In reality, it is not towards a new intellectualism
that the theory moves. Whether its authors are aware of it or not, they
are trying to formulate what we shall call an existential theory of
aphasia, that is, a theory which treats thought and objective language as
18

Notions of this kind appear in the works of Head, van Woerkom, Bouman and
Grünbaum, and Goldstein.

221

222 phenomenology of perception
two manifestations of that fundamental activity whereby man projects
himself towards a ‘world’.19 Take, for example, amnesia relating to
names of colours. It is demonstrated, by sorting tests, that the suﬀerer
from amnesia has lost the general ability to subsume colours under a
category, and to this same cause is attributed the verbal deﬁciency. But
if we go back to concrete descriptions we notice that the categorial
activity, before being a thought or a form of knowledge, is a certain
manner of relating oneself to the world, and, correspondingly, a style
or shape of experience. In a normal subject, the perception of a heap of
samples is organized in virtue of the task set: ‘The colours belonging to
the same category as the model sample stand out against the background of the rest’,20 all the reds, for example, forming a group, and
the subject has now only to split up this group in order to bring
together all the samples which belong to it. For the patient, on the
other hand, each of the samples is conﬁned within its individual existence. Against the formation of any group according to a given principle, they bring a sort of viscosity or inertia. When two objectively
similar colours are presented to the patient, they do not necessarily
appear similar: it may happen that in one the basic shade is dominant,
in the other the degree of lightness or warmth.21 We can ourselves
experience something similar by taking up, before a pile of samples, an
attitude of passive perception: the identical colours group themselves
before our eyes, but those colours which are merely rather alike establish only vague mutual relations, ‘the heap seems unstable, shifting, and
we observe an incessant alteration in it, a kind of contest between
several possible groupings of colours according to diﬀerent points of
view’.22 We are reduced to the immediate experience of relationships
(Kohärenzerlebnis, Erlebnis des Passens) and such is probably the experience of
the patient. We were wrong to say that he cannot abide by a given
principle of classiﬁcation, but goes from one to the other: in reality he

Grünbaum, for example (Aphasie und Motorik) shows both that aphasic disturbances are
general and that they are motor, in other words he makes motility into an original mode of
intentionality or meaning (cf. above, pp. 227–8), which amounts to conceiving man, no
longer in terms of consciousness, but in terms of existence.

never adopts any.23 The disturbance touches ‘the way in which the
colours group themselves for the observer, the way in which the visual
ﬁeld is put together from the point of view of colours’.24 It is not only
the thought or knowledge, but the very experience of colours which is
in question. We might say with another author that normal experience
involves ‘circles’ or ‘vortices’ within which each element is representative of all others and carries, as it were, ‘vectors’ which link it to them.
In the patient, ‘this life is enclosed in narrower limits, and, compared
to the normal subject’s perceived world, it moves in smaller and more
restricted circles. A movement which has its origin on the periphery of
the vortex no longer spreads immediately as far as its centre, but
remains, so to speak, within the stimulated area or may be transmitted
to its immediate surrounding, but no further. More comprehensive
units of meaning can no longer be built up within the perceived
world. . . . Here again, each sense impression is provided with a
“meaning-vector”, but these vectors have no common direction, for,
being no longer directed towards main determinate centres, they
diverge much more than in the normal person.’25 Such is the disturbance of ‘thought’ discoverable at the root of amnesia; it can be seen that
it concerns not so much the judgement as the setting of experience in
which the judgement has its source, not so much spontaneity as the
footing which spontaneity has in the perceptible world, and our ability
to discern in it any intention whatsoever. In Kantian terms: it aﬀects not
so much the understanding as the productive imagination. The categorial act is therefore not an ultimate fact, it builds itself up within a
certain ‘attitude’ (Einstellung). It is on this attitude, moreover, that speech
is based, so that there can be no question of making language rest upon
pure thought. ‘Categorial behaviour and the possession of meaningful
language express one and the same fundamental form of behaviour.
Neither can be a cause or eﬀect of the other.’26 In the ﬁrst place,
thought is not an eﬀect of language. It is true that certain patients,27
being unable to group colours by comparing them to a given sample,

succeed through the intermediary of language: they name the colour of
the exemplar and subsequently collect together all the samples which
that name ﬁts without looking back at the exemplar. It is true also that
abnormal children28 classify even diﬀerent colours together if they have
been taught to call them by the same name. But these are precisely
abnormal procedures; they do not express the essential relationship
between language and thought, but the pathological or accidental relaship of language and thought both cut oﬀ from their living signiﬁcance. Indeed, many patients are able to repeat the names of the colours
without being any more capable of classifying them. In cases of
amnesic aphasia, ‘it cannot, therefore, be the lack of the word taken in
itself which makes categorial behaviour diﬃcult or impossible. Words
must have lost something which normally belongs to them and which
ﬁts them for use in relation to categorial behaviour.’29 What have they
lost? Their notional signiﬁcance? Must we say that the concept has been
withdrawn from them, thus making thought the cause of language?
But clearly, when the word loses its meaning, it is modiﬁed down to its
sensible aspect, it is emptied.30 The patient suﬀering from amnesia, to
whom a colour name is given, and who is asked to choose a corresponding sample, repeats the name as if he expected something to come
of it. But the name is now useless to him, it tells him nothing more, it is
alien and absurd, as are for us names which we go on repeating for too
long a time.31 Patients for whom words have lost their meaning sometimes retain in the highest degree the ability to associate ideas.32 The
name, therefore, has not become separated from former ‘associations’,
it has suﬀered deterioration, like some inanimate body. The link
between the word and its living meaning is not an external link of
association, the meaning inhabits the word, and language ‘is not an
external accompaniment to intellectual processes’.33 We are therefore

the body as expression, and speech

led to recognize a gestural or existential signiﬁcance in speech, as we
have already said. Language certainly has an inner content, but this is
not self-subsistent and self-conscious thought. What then does language express, if it does not express thoughts? It presents or rather it is
the subject’s taking up of a position in the world of his meanings. The
term ‘world’ here is not a manner of speaking: it means that the ‘mental’ or cultural life borrows its structures from natural life and that the
thinking subject must have its basis in the subject incarnate. The phonetic ‘gesture’ brings about, both for the speaking subject and for his
hearers, a certain structural co-ordination of experience, a certain
modulation of existence, exactly as a pattern of my bodily behaviour
endows the objects around me with a certain signiﬁcance both for me
and for others. The meaning of the gesture is not contained in it like
some physical or physiological phenomenon. The meaning of the
word is not contained in the word as a sound. But the human body is
deﬁned in terms of its property of appropriating, in an indeﬁnite series
of discontinuous acts, signiﬁcant cores which transcend and transﬁgure its natural powers. This act of transcendence is ﬁrst encountered
in the acquisition of a pattern of behaviour, then in the mute communication of gesture: it is through the same power that the body
opens itself to some new kind of conduct and makes it understood to
external witnesses. Here and there a system of deﬁnite powers is suddenly decentralized, broken up and reorganized under a fresh law
unknown to the subject or to the external witness, and one which
reveals itself to them at the very moment at which the process occurs.
For example, the knitting of the brows intended, according to Darwin,
to protect the eye from the sun, or the narrowing of the eyes to enable
one to see sharply, become component parts of the human act of
meditation, and convey this to an observer. Language, in its turn, presents no diﬀerent a problem: a contraction of the throat, a sibilant
emission of air between the tongue and teeth, a certain way of bringing
the body into play suddenly allows itself to be invested with a ﬁgurative
signiﬁcance which is conveyed outside us. This is neither more nor less
miraculous than the emergence of love from desire, or that of gesture
from the unco-ordinated movements of infancy. For the miracle to
come about, phonetic ‘gesticulation’ must use an alphabet of already
acquired meanings, the word-gesture must be performed in a certain

225

226 phenomenology of perception
setting common to the speakers, just as the comprehension of other
gestures presupposes a perceived world common to all, in which each
one develops and spreads out its meaning. But this condition is not
suﬃcient: speech puts up a new sense, if it is authentic speech, just as
gesture endows the object for the ﬁrst time with human signiﬁcance, if
it is an initiating gesture. Moreover signiﬁcances now acquired must
necessarily have been new once. We must therefore recognize as an
ultimate fact this open and indeﬁnite power of giving signiﬁcance—
that is, both of apprehending and conveying a meaning—by which
man transcends himself towards a new form of behaviour, or towards
other people, or towards his own thought, through his body and his
speech.
When authors try to bring the analysis of aphasia to its conclusion in
some general conception of language34 they can more clearly be seen
forsaking the intellectualist language which they adopted after Pierre
Marie and in reaction against the conceptions of Broca. It cannot be
said of speech either that it is an ‘operation of intelligence’, or that it is
a ‘motor phenomenon’: it is wholly motility and wholly intelligence.
What establishes its inherence in the body is the fact that linguistic
deﬁciencies cannot be reduced to a unity, and that the primary disturbances aﬀect sometimes the body of the word, the material instrument
of verbal expression—sometimes the word’s physiognomy, the verbal
intention, the kind of group image on the basis of which we succeed in
saying or writing down a word exactly—sometimes the immediate
meaning of the word, what German writers call the verbal concept—
and sometimes the structure of the whole experience, not merely the
linguistic experience, as in the case of amnesic aphasia examined
above. Speech, then, rests upon a stratiﬁcation of powers relatively
capable of being isolated. But at the same time it is impossible to ﬁnd
anywhere a linguistic disturbance which is ‘purely motor’ and which
does not to some extent impinge upon the signiﬁcance of language. In
pure alexia,* if the subject can no longer recognize the letters of a
word, it is through inability to pattern the visual data, or constitute the

the body as expression, and speech

word’s structure, or apprehend its visual signiﬁcance. In motor aphasia,
the list of words lost and preserved does not correspond to their objective characteristics (length or complexity), but to their value from the
subject’s point of view: the patient is unable to pronounce, in isolation,
a letter or word within a familiar motor series, through being incapable
of diﬀerentiating between the ‘ﬁgure’ and ‘background’ and freely
conferring upon a certain word or letter the value of a ﬁgure. Articulatory and syntactical accuracy always stand in inverse ratio to each other,
which shows that the articulation of a word is not a merely motor
phenomenon, but that it draws upon the same energies which organize
the syntactical order. When disturbances of verbal intention are present, as in the case of literal paraphasia* in which letters are omitted,
displaced, or added, and in which the rhythm of the word is changed,
it is, a fortiori, clearly not a question of a destruction of engrams,† but of
the reduction to a common level of ﬁgure and background, of a
powerlessness to structurize the word and grasp its articulatory
physiognomy.35
If we are to summarize these two sets of observations, we shall have
to say that any linguistic operation presupposes the apprehension of a
signiﬁcance, but that the signiﬁcance in both cases is, as it were, specialized: there are diﬀerent layers of signiﬁcance, from the visual to the
conceptual by way of the verbal concept. These two ideas will never be
simultaneously understood unless we cease to vacillate between the
notions of ‘motility’ and ‘intelligence’, and unless we discover a third
notion which enables us to integrate them, a function which shall be
the same at all levels, which shall be equally at work in the hidden
preliminaries to speech and in articulatory phenomena, which shall

to motor exteriorization, and the psychophysical structures on which it rests, as a
fundamental ﬁeld which dominates the picture of aphasia’ (p. 386).

227

228 phenomenology of perception
support the whole ediﬁce of language, and which nevertheless shall be
stabilized in relatively autonomous processes. We shall have the
opportunity of seeing this power, essential to speech, in cases in which
neither thought nor ‘motility’ is noticeably aﬀected, and yet in which
the ‘life’ of language is impaired. It does happen that vocabulary, syntax and the body of language appear intact, the only peculiarity being
that main clauses predominate. But the patient does not make the same
use as the normal subject of these materials. He speaks practically only
when he is questioned, or, if he himself takes the initiative in asking a
question, it is never other than of a stereotyped kind, such as he asks
daily of his children when they come home from school. He never uses
language to convey a merely possible situation, and false statements
(e.g. the sky is black) are meaningless to him. He can speak only if he
has prepared his sentences.36 It cannot be held that language in his case
has become automatic; there is no sign of a decline of general intelligence, and it is still the case that words are organized through their
meaning. But the meaning is, as it were, ossiﬁed. Schneider never feels
the need to speak; his experience never tends towards speech, it never
suggests a question to him, it never ceases to have that kind of selfevidence and self-suﬃciency of reality which stiﬂes any interrogation,
any reference to the possible, any wonder, any improvisation. We can
perceive, in contrast with this, the essence of normal language: the
intention to speak can reside only in an open experience. It makes its
appearance like the boiling point of a liquid, when, in the density of
being, volumes of empty space are built up and move outwards. ‘As
soon as man uses language to establish a living relation with himself or
with his fellows, language is no longer an instrument, no longer a means; it
is a manifestation, a revelation of intimate being and of the psychic link which unites us
to the world and our fellow men. The patient’s language may display great
knowledge, it may be capable of being turned to account for speciﬁc
activities, but it is totally lacking in that productivity which is man’s
deepest essence and which is perhaps revealed nowhere so clearly,
among civilisation’s creations, as in the creation of language itself.’37 It

the body as expression, and speech

might be said, restating a celebrated distinction, that languages or constituted systems of vocabulary and syntax, empirically existing ‘means of
expression’, are both the repository and residue of acts of speech, in
which unformulated signiﬁcance not only ﬁnds the means of being
conveyed outwardly, but moreover acquires existence for itself, and is
genuinely created as signiﬁcance. Or again one might draw a distinction between a speaking word and a spoken word. The former is the one in
which the signiﬁcant intention is at the stage of coming into being.
Here existence is polarized into a certain ‘signiﬁcance’* which cannot
be deﬁned in terms of any natural object. It is somewhere at a point
beyond being that it aims to catch up with itself again, and that is why
it creates speech as an empirical support for its own not-being. Speech
is the surplus of our existence over natural being. But the act of expression constitutes a linguistic world and a cultural world, and allows that
to fall back into being which was striving to outstrip it. Hence the
spoken word, which enjoys available signiﬁcances as one might enjoy
an acquired fortune. From these gains other acts of authentic
expression—the writer’s, artist’s or philosopher’s—are made possible.
This ever-recreated opening in the plenitude of being is what conditions the child’s ﬁrst use of speech and the language of the writer, as it
does the construction of the word and that of concepts. Such is the
function which we intuit through language, which reiterates itself,
which is its own foundation, or which, like a wave, gathers and poises
itself to hurtle beyond its own limits.
The analysis of speech and expression brings home to us the enigmatic nature of our own body even more eﬀectively than did our
remarks on bodily space and unity. It is not a collection of particles,
each one remaining in itself, nor yet a network of processes deﬁned
once and for all—it is not where it is, nor what it is—since we see it
secreting in itself a ‘signiﬁcance’ which comes to it from nowhere,
projecting that signiﬁcance upon its material surrounding, and communicating it to other embodied subjects. It has always been observed
that speech or gesture transﬁgure the body, but no more was said on
the subject than that they develop or disclose another power, that of
thought or soul. The fact was overlooked that, in order to express it, the
* ‘sens’ in French means ‘direction’ and ‘signiﬁcance’ (Translator’s note).

229

230 phenomenology of perception
body must in the last analysis become the thought or intention that it
signiﬁes for us. It is the body which points out, and which speaks; so
much we have learnt in this chapter. Cézanne used to say of a portrait:
‘If I paint in all the little blue and brown touches, I make him gaze as he
does gaze. . . . Never mind if they question how, by bringing together a
green of various shades and a red, we can sadden a mouth or bring a
smile to a cheek.’38 This disclosure of an immanent or incipient signiﬁcance in the living body extends, as we shall see, to the whole sensible
world, and our gaze, prompted by the experience of our own body,
will discover in all other ‘objects’ the miracle of expression. In his Peau
de Chagrin Balzac describes a ‘white tablecloth, like a covering of snow
newly fallen, from which rose symmetrically the plates and napkins
crowned with light-coloured rolls’. ‘Throughout my youth,’ Cézanne
said, ‘I wanted to paint that table-cloth like freshly fallen snow. . . . I
know now that one must try to paint only: “the plates and napkins rose
symmetrically”, and “the light-coloured rolls”. If I paint: “crowned”,
I’m ﬁnished, you see. And if I really balance and shade my napkins and
rolls as they really are, you may be sure that the crowning, the snow
and all the rest of it will be there.’39 The problem of the world, and, to
begin with, that of one’s own body, consists in the fact that it is all there.
We have become accustomed, through the inﬂuence of the Cartesian
tradition, to disengage from the object: the reﬂective attitude simultaneously puriﬁes the common notions of body and soul by deﬁning
the body as the sum of its parts with no interior, and the soul as a being
wholly present to itself without distance. These deﬁnitions make matters perfectly clear both within and outside ourselves: we have the
transparency of an object with no secret recesses, the transparency of a
subject which is nothing but what it thinks it is. The object is an object
through and through, and consciousness a consciousness through and
through. There are two senses, and two only, of the word ‘exist’: one
exists as a thing or else one exists as a consciousness. The experience of
our own body, on the other hand, reveals to us an ambiguous mode of
existing. If I try to think of it as a cluster of third person processes—
‘sight’, ‘motility’, ‘sexuality’—I observe that these ‘functions’ cannot

the body as expression, and speech

be interrelated, and related to the external world, by causal connections, they are all obscurely drawn together and mutually implied in a
unique drama. Therefore the body is not an object. For the same reason, my awareness of it is not a thought, that is to say, I cannot take it to
pieces and reform it to make a clear idea. Its unity is always implicit and
vague. It is always something other than what it is, always sexuality and
at the same time freedom, rooted in nature at the very moment when it
is transformed by cultural inﬂuences, never hermetically sealed and
never left behind. Whether it is a question of another’s body or my
own, I have no means of knowing the human body other than that of
living it, which means taking up on my own account the drama which
is being played out in it, and losing myself in it. I am my body, at least
wholly to the extent that I possess experience, and yet at the same time
my body is as it were a ‘natural’ subject, a provisional sketch of my total
being. Thus experience of one’s own body runs counter to the reﬂective procedure which detaches subject and object from each other, and
which gives us only the thought about the body, or the body as an idea,
and not the experience of the body or the body in reality. Descartes was
well aware of this, since a famous letter of his to Elizabeth draws the
distinction between the body as it is conceived through use in living
and the body as it is conceived by the understanding.40 But in Descartes
this peculiar knowledge of our body, which we enjoy from the mere
fact that we are a body, remains subordinated to our knowledge of it
through the medium of ideas, because, behind man as he in fact is,
stands God as the rational author of our de facto situation. On the basis of
this transcendent guarantee, Descartes can blandly accept our irrational
condition: it is not we who are required to bear the responsibility for
reason and, once we have recognized it at the basis of things, it remains
for us only to act and think in the world.41 But if our union with the

‘Finally, as I consider that it is very necessary to have understood, once in one’s
lifetime, the principles of metaphysics, since they are what provide us with knowledge of
God and our soul, I think too, however, that it would be extremely harmful to occupy our
mind often in meditating upon them, since it could not then attend so eﬀectively to the
work of imagination and the senses; but that the best course is merely to retain in
memory and belief conclusions once arrived at, and thenceforth to employ the rest of the
time one can devote to study to thoughts in which the understanding acts along with the
imagination and the senses.’ Ibid.

body is substantial, how is it possible for us to experience in ourselves a
pure soul from which to accede to an absolute Spirit? Before asking this
question, let us look closely at what is implied in the rediscovery of our
own body. It is not merely one object among the rest which has the
peculiarity of resisting reﬂection and remaining, so to speak, stuck to
the subject. Obscurity spreads to the perceived world in its entirety.

Part II
The World as Perceived

THE THEORY OF THE BODY
IS ALREADY A THEORY
OF PERCEPTION
Our own body is in the world as the heart is in the organism: it keeps
the visible spectacle constantly alive, it breathes life into it and sustains
it inwardly, and with it forms a system. When I walk round my ﬂat, the
various aspects in which it presents itself to me could not possibly
appear as views of one and the same thing if I did not know that each
of them represents the ﬂat seen from one spot or another, and if I were
unaware of my own movements, and of my body as retaining its identity through the stages of those movements. I can of course take a
mental bird’s eye view of the ﬂat, visualize it or draw a plan of it on
paper, but in that case too I could not grasp the unity of the object
without the mediation of bodily experience, for what I call a plan is
only a more comprehensive perspective: it is the ﬂat ‘seen from above’,
and the fact that I am able to draw together in it all habitual perspectives is dependent on my knowing that one and the same embodied
subject can view successively from various positions. It will perhaps be
objected that by restoring the object to bodily experience as one of the
poles of that experience, we deprive it of precisely that which constitutes its objectivity. From the point of view of my body I never see as

236 phenomenology of perception
equal the six sides of the cube, even if it is made of glass, and yet the
word ‘cube’ has a meaning; the cube itself, the cube in reality, beyond
its sensible appearances, has its six equal sides. As I move round it, I see
the front face, hitherto a square, change its shape, then disappear, while
the other sides come into view and one by one become squares. But the
successive stages of this experience are for me merely the opportunity
of conceiving the whole cube with its six equal and simultaneous faces,
the intelligible structure which provides the explanation of it. And it is
even necessary, for my tour of inspection of the cube to warrant the
judgement: ‘here is a cube’, that my movements themselves be located
in objective space and, far from its being the case that the experience of
my own movement conditions the position of an object, it is, on the
contrary, by conceiving my body itself as a mobile object that I am able
to interpret perceptual appearance and construct the cube as it truly is.
The experience of my own movement would therefore appear to be no
more than a psychological circumstance of perception and to make no
contribution to determining the signiﬁcance of the object. The object
and my body would certainly form a system, but we would then have a
nexus of objective correlations and not, as we were saying earlier, a
collection of lived-through correspondences. The unity of the object
would thus be conceived, not experienced as the correlate of our
body’s unity.
But can the object be thus detached from the actual conditions under
which it is presented to us? One can bring together discursively the
notion of the number six, the notion of ‘side’ and that of equality, and
link them together in a formula which is the deﬁnition of the cube. But
this deﬁnition rather puts a question to us than oﬀers us something to
conceive. One emerges from blind, symbolic thought only by perceiving the particular spatial entity which bears these predicates all
together. It is a question of tracing in thought that particular form
which encloses a fragment of space between six equal faces. Now, if the
words ‘enclose’ and ‘between’ have a meaning for us, it is because they
derive it from our experience as embodied subjects. In space itself
independently of the presence of a psycho-physical subject, there is no
direction, no inside and no outside. A space is ‘enclosed’ between the
sides of a cube as we are enclosed between the walls of our room. In
order to be able to conceive the cube, we take up a position in space,

theory of the body is already a theory of perception

now on its surface, now in it, now outside it, and from that moment we
see it in perspective. The cube with six equal sides is not only invisible,
but inconceivable; it is the cube as it would be for itself; but the cube is
not for itself, since it is an object. There is a ﬁrst order dogmatism, of
which analytical reﬂection rids us, and which consists in asserting that
the object is in itself, or absolutely, without wondering what it is. But
there is another, which consists in aﬃrming the ostensible signiﬁcance
of the object, without wondering how it enters into our experience.
Analytical reﬂection puts forward, instead of the absolute existence of
the object, the thought of an absolute object, and, through trying to
dominate the object and think of it from no point of view, it destroys
the object’s internal structure. If there is, for me, a cube with six equal
sides, and if I can link up with the object, this is not because I constitute it from the inside: it is because I delve into the thickness of the
world by perceptual experience. The cube with six equal sides is the
limiting idea whereby I express the material presence of the cube
which is there before my eyes, under my hands, in its perceptual selfevidence. The sides of the cube are not projections of it, but precisely
sides. When I perceive them successively, with the appearance they
present in diﬀerent perspectives, I do not construct the idea of the
geometrized projection which accounts for these perspectives: the
cube is already there in front of me and reveals itself through them. I do
not need to take an objective view of my own movement, or take it into
account, in order to reconstitute the true form of the object behind its
appearing: the account is already taken, and already the new appearance has compounded itself with the lived-through movement and
presented itself as an appearance of a cube. The thing, and the world,
are given to me along with the parts of my body, not by any ‘natural
geometry’, but in a living connection comparable, or rather identical,
with that existing between the parts of my body itself.
External perception and the perception of one’s own body vary in
conjunction because they are the two facets of one and the same act.
The attempt has long been made to explain Aristotle’s celebrated illusion by allowing that the unaccustomed position of the ﬁngers makes
the synthesis of their perceptions impossible: the right side of the
middle ﬁnger and the left side of the index do not ordinarily ‘work’
together, and if both are touched at once, then there must be two

237

238 phenomenology of perception
marbles. In reality, the perceptions of the two ﬁngers are not only
disjoined, they are inverted: the subject attributes to the index what is
touched by the middle ﬁnger and vice versa, as can be shown by applying
two distinct stimuli to the ﬁngers, a point and a ball, for example.1
Aristotle’s illusion is primarily a disturbance of the body image. What
makes the synthesis of the two tactile perceptions in one single object
impossible, is not so much that the position of the ﬁngers is
unaccustomed or statistically rare, it is that the right face of the middle
ﬁnger and the left face of the index cannot combine in a joint exploration of the object, that the crossing of the ﬁngers, being a movement
which has to be imposed on them, lies outside the motor possibilities
of the ﬁngers themselves and cannot be aimed at in a project towards
movement. The synthesis of the object is here eﬀected, then, through
the synthesis of one’s own body, it is the reply or correlative to it, and
it is literally the same thing to perceive one single marble, and to use
two ﬁngers as one single organ. The disturbance of the body image
may even be directly translated into the external world without the
intervention of any stimulus. In heautoscopy, before seeing himself,
the subject always passes through a state akin to dreaming, musing or
disquiet, and the image of himself which appears outside him is merely
the counterpart of this depersonalization.2 The patient has the feeling
of being in the double outside himself, just as, in a lift which goes
upwards and suddenly stops, I feel the substance of my body escaping
from me through my head and overrunning the boundaries of my
objective body. It is in his own body that the patient feels the approach
of this Other whom he has never seen with his eyes, as the normal
person is aware, through a certain burning feeling in the nape of
the neck, that someone is watching him from behind.3 Conversely, a
certain form of external experience implies and produces a certain

the subject is overcome by a feeling of profound sadness which spreads outwards and
into the very image of the double, which seems to be ﬁlled with eﬀective vibrations
identical with those experienced by the original person’; ‘his consciousness seems to
have moved wholly outside himself’. And Menninger-Lerchenthal, Das Truggebilde der eigenen

theory of the body is already a theory of perception

consciousness of one’s own body. Many patients speak of a ‘sixth
sense’ which seems to produce their hallucinations. Stratton’s subject,
whose visual ﬁeld has been objectively inverted, at ﬁrst sees everything
upside down; on the third day of the experiment, when things are
beginning to regain their upright position, he is ﬁlled with ‘the strange
impression of looking at the ﬁre out of the back of his head’.4 This is
because there is an immediate equivalence between the orientation of
the visual ﬁeld and the awareness of one’s own body as the potentiality
of that ﬁeld, so that any upheaval experimentally brought about can
appear indiﬀerently either as the inversion of phenomenal objects or as
a redistribution of sensory functions in the body. If a subject focuses
for long-distance vision, he has a double image of his own ﬁnger as
indeed of all objects near to him. If he is touched or pricked, he is
aware of being touched or pricked in two places.5 Diplopia is thus
extended into a bodily duplication. Every external perception is
immediately synonymous with a certain perception of my body, just as
every perception of my body is made explicit in the language of
external perception. If, then, as we have seen to be the case, the body is
not a transparent object, and is not presented to us in virtue of the law
of its constitution, as the circle is to the geometer, if it is an expressive
unity which we can learn to know only by actively taking it up, this
structure will be passed on to the sensible world. The theory of the
body schema is, implicitly, a theory of perception. We have relearned
to feel our body; we have found underneath the objective and detached
knowledge of the body that other knowledge which we have of it in
virtue of its always being with us and of the fact that we are our body.
In the same way we shall need to reawaken our experience of the world
as it appears to us in so far as we are in the world through our body,
and in so far as we perceive the world with our body. But by thus
remaking contact with the body and with the world, we shall also
rediscover ourself, since, perceiving as we do with our body, the body
is a natural self and, as it were, the subject of perception.

1
SENSE EXPERIENCE
Objective thought is unaware of the subject of perception. This is
because it presents itself with the world ready made, as the setting of
every possible event, and treats perception as one of these events. For
example, the empiricist philosopher considers a subject x in the act of
perceiving and tries to describe what happens: there are sensations
which are the subject’s states or manners of being and, in virtue of this,
genuine mental things. The perceiving subject is the place where these
things occur, and the philosopher describes sensations and their substratum as one might describe the fauna of a distant land—without
being aware that he himself perceives, that he is the perceiving subject
and that perception as he lives it belies everything that he says of
perception in general. For, seen from the inside, perception owes nothing to what we know in other ways about the world, about stimuli as
physics describes them and about the sense organs as described by
biology. It does not present itself in the ﬁrst place as an event in the
world to which the category of causality, for example, can be applied,
but as a re-creation or re-constitution of the world at every moment. In
so far as we believe in the world’s past, in the physical world, in
‘stimuli’, in the organism as our books depict it, it is ﬁrst of all because
we have present at this moment to us a perceptual ﬁeld, a surface in
contact with the world, a permanent rootedness in it, and because the

sense experience

world ceaselessly assails and beleaguers subjectivity as waves wash
round a wreck on the shore. All knowledge takes its place within the
horizons opened up by perception. There can be no question of
describing perception itself as one of the facts thrown up in the world,
since we can never ﬁll up, in the picture of the world, that gap which
we ourselves are, and by which it comes into existence for someone,
since perception is the ‘ﬂaw’ in this ‘great diamond’.* Intellectualism
certainly represents a step forward in coming to self-consciousness:
that place outside the world at which the empiricist philosopher hints,
and in which he tacitly takes up his position in order to describe the
event of perception, now receives a name, and appears in the description. It is the transcendental Ego. Through it every empiricist thesis is
reversed: the state of consciousness becomes the consciousness of a
state, passivity the positing of passivity, the world becomes the correlative of thought about the world and henceforth exists only for a constituting agent. And yet it remains true to say that intellectualism too
provides itself with a ready-made world. For the constitution of the
world, as conceived by it, is a mere requirement that to each term of
the empiricist description be added the indication ‘consciousness
of . . .’ The whole system of experience—world, own body and
empirical self—are subordinated to a universal thinker charged with
sustaining the relationships between the three terms. But, since he is
not actually involved, these relationships remain what they were in
empiricism: causal relations spread out in the context of cosmic events.
Now, if one’s own body and the empirical self are no more than
elements of the system of experience, objects among other objects in
the eyes of the true I, how can we ever be confused with our body?
How can we ever have believed that we saw with our eyes what we in
fact grasp through an inspection of the mind; how is it that the world
does not present itself to us as perfectly explicit; why is it displayed
only gradually and never ‘in its entirety’? In short, how does it come
about that we perceive? We shall understand this only if the empirical
self and the body are not immediately objects, in fact only if they never

quite become objects, if there is a certain signiﬁcance in saying that I
can see the piece of wax with my eyes, and if correlatively the possibility of absence, the dimension of escape and freedom which reﬂection
opens in the depths of our being, and which is called the transcendental Ego, are not initially given and are never absolutely acquired; if I
can never say ‘I’ absolutely, and if every act of reﬂection, every voluntary taking up of a position is based on the ground and the proposition
of a life of pre-personal consciousness. The subject of perception will
remain overlooked as long as we cannot avoid the alternative of natura
naturata and natural naturans, of sensation as a state of consciousness and as
the consciousness of a state, of existence in itself and existence for itself.
Let us then return to sensation and scrutinize it closely enough to learn
from it the living relation of the perceiver to his body and to his world.
Inductive psychology will help us in our search for a new status for
sensation, by showing that it is neither a state or a quality, nor the
consciousness of a state or of a quality. In fact, each of the alleged
qualities—red, blue, colour, sound—is inserted into a certain form of
behaviour. In the normal subject a sensory excitation, particularly of
the experimental kind which has practically no living signiﬁcance for
him, scarcely has any eﬀect on general motility. But diseases of the
cerebellum or the frontal cortex clearly show what eﬀect sensory excitations would have on muscular tonicity, if they were not integrated
into a comprehensive situation, and if tonicity were not, in the normal
person, adjusted to certain special tasks. The gesture of raising the arm,
which can be taken as an indicator of motor disturbance, is diﬀerently
modiﬁed in its sweep and its direction according as the visual ﬁeld is
red, yellow, blue or green. Red and yellow are particularly productive
of smooth movements, blue and green of jerky ones; red applied to the
right eye, for example, favours a corresponding stretching of the arm
outwards, green the bending of the arm back towards the body.1 The
privileged position of the arm—the one in which the arm is felt to be
balanced and at rest—which is farther away from the body in the
patient than in the normal subject, is modiﬁed by the presentation of
colours: green brings it back nearer to the body.2 The colour of the
1

sense experience

visual ﬁeld aﬀects the accuracy of the subject’s reactions, whether it is a
question of performing a movement of a given extent or measuring
with the ﬁnger a deﬁnite length. With a green visual ﬁeld the assessment is accurate, with a red one the subject errs on the side of excess.
Movements outwards are accelerated by green and slowed down by
red. Localization of stimuli on the skin is modiﬁed by red in the direction of abduction. Yellow and red emphasize errors in judging weight
and time, though in the case of cerebellar patients blue and particularly
green have a compensating eﬀect. In these various experiments each
colour always acts with the same tendency, with the result that a
deﬁnite motor value can be assigned to it. Generally speaking, red
and yellow favour abduction, blue and green abduction. Now, on the
whole, the signiﬁcance of abduction is that the organism turns towards
the stimulus and is attracted by the world—of abduction that it turns
away from the stimulus and withdraws towards its centre.3 Sensations,
‘sensible qualities’ are then far from being reducible to a certain
indescribable state or quale; they present themselves with a motor
physiognomy, and are enveloped in a living signiﬁcance. It has long
been known that sensations have a ‘motor accompaniment’, that stimuli set in motion ‘incipient movements’ which are associated with the
sensation of the quality and create a halo round it, and that the ‘perceptual side’ and the ‘motor side’ of behaviour are in communication
with each other. But it is usual to proceed as if this relation left
unaﬀected the terms between which it stands. For there is no question,
in the examples given above, of an external, causal relationship leaving
the sensation itself unchanged. Motor reactions produced by blue,
‘blue-occasioned conduct’, are not the eﬀects of colour on the objective body, deﬁned in terms of speciﬁc wavelength and intensity: for
a blue produced by contrast, and therefore having no physical phenomenon corresponding to it, has around it the same motor halo.4
Where the motor physiognomy of colour is constituted is not in the
physicist’s world, as a result of some occult process. Is it then ‘in
consciousness’, and must we say that the experience of blue as a sensible quality produces a certain change in the phenomenal body? But it
3

243

244 phenomenology of perception
is not obvious why the clear awareness of a certain quale should aﬀect
my judgement of sizes, and moreover the felt eﬀect of colour does not
always exactly correspond to the inﬂuence exerted by it on behaviour:
red may accentuate my reactions without my being aware of it.5 The
motor signiﬁcance of colours is comprehensible only if they cease to be
closed states or indescribable qualities presented to an observing and
thinking subject, and if they impinge within me upon a certain general
setting through which I come to terms with the world; if, moreover,
they suggest to me a new manner of evaluating, and yet if motility
ceases to be the mere consciousness of my movements from place to
place in the present or immediate future, and becomes the function
which constantly lays down my standards of size and the varying scope
of my being in the world. Blue is that which prompts me to look in a
certain way, that which allows my gaze to run over it in a speciﬁc
manner. It is a certain ﬁeld or atmosphere presented to the power of my
eyes and of my whole body. Here the experience of colours conﬁrms
and elucidates the correlations established by inductive psychology.
Green is commonly regarded as a ‘restful’ colour. ‘It encloses me
within myself and brings a peaceful state,’ says one patient.6 It ‘makes
no demands on us and does not enjoin us to do anything,’ says Kandinsky. Blue seems to ‘yield to our gaze,’ says Goethe. On the other
hand, he adds, red ‘invades the eye.’7 Red has a ‘rending’, and yellow
a ‘stinging’ eﬀect, says one of Goldstein’s patients. Generally speaking
we have on the one hand, with red and yellow, ‘an experience of being
torn away, of a movement away from the centre’; on the other hand,
with blue and green, that of ‘repose and concentration’.8 We can reveal
the soporiﬁc and motor basis of qualities, or their vital signiﬁcance, by
employing stimuli which are either weak or of short duration. In this
case the colour, before being seen, gives itself away through the experience of a certain bodily attitude appropriate only to that colour and
precisely indicative of it: ‘there is in my body a sensation of slipping

downwards, so that it cannot be green, and can be only blue but in fact
I see no blue’,9 says one subject. Another says: ‘I clenched my teeth, and
so I know that it is yellow.’10 If a light stimulus is gradually increased
from a subliminal intensity, there is ﬁrst of all the experience of a
certain bodily disposition and suddenly the sensation runs into and
‘spreads through the visual domain’.11 Just as, when I look closely at
snow, I break its apparent ‘whiteness’ up into a world of reﬂections and
transparencies, so within a musical note a ‘micromelody’ can be picked
out and the interval heard is merely the ﬁnal patterning of a certain
tension felt throughout the body.12
The representation of a colour in subjects who have lost it is made
possible by displaying before them any real colours whatsoever. The
real colour produces in the subject a ‘concentration of colour experience’ which enables him to ‘draw together the colours in his eye’.13
Thus, before becoming an objective spectacle, quality is revealed by a
type of behaviour which is directed towards it in its essence, and this is
why my body has no sooner adopted the attitude of blue than I am
vouchsafed a quasi-presence of blue. We must therefore stop wondering how and why red signiﬁes eﬀort or violence, green restfulness and
peace; we must rediscover how to live these colours as our body does,
that is, as peace or violence in concrete form. When we say that red
increases the compass of our reactions, we are not to be understood as
having in mind two distinct facts, a sensation of redness and motor
reactions—we must be understood as meaning that red, by its texture
as followed and adhered to by our gaze, is already the ampliﬁcation of
our motor being. The subject of sensation is neither a thinker who takes
note of a quality, nor an inert setting which is aﬀected or changed by
it, it is a power which is born into, and simultaneously with, a certain
existential environment, or is synchronized with it. The relations of
sentient to sensible are comparable with those of the sleeper to his
slumber: sleep comes when a certain voluntary attitude suddenly

receives from outside the conﬁrmation for which it was waiting. I am
breathing deeply and slowly in order to summon sleep, and suddenly it
is as if my mouth were connected to some great lung outside myself
which alternately calls forth and forces back my breath. A certain
rhythm of respiration, which a moment ago I voluntarily maintained,
now becomes my very being, and sleep, until now aimed at as a signiﬁcance, suddenly becomes a situation. In the same way I give ear, or
look, in the expectation of a sensation, and suddenly the sensible takes
possession of my ear or my gaze, and I surrender a part of my body,
even my whole body, to this particular manner of vibrating and ﬁlling
space known as blue or red. Just as the sacrament not only symbolizes,
in sensible species, an operation of Grace, but is also the real presence
of God, which it causes to occupy a fragment of space and communicates to those who eat of the consecrated bread, provided that they are
inwardly prepared, in the same way the sensible has not only a motor
and vital signiﬁcance, but is nothing other than a certain way of being
in the world suggested to us from some point in space, and seized and
acted upon by our body, provided that it is capable of doing so, so that
sensation is literally a form of communion.
Taking this view, it becomes possible to attach to the notion of
‘signiﬁcance’ a value which intellectualism withholds from it. My sensation and my perception, according to this theory, are capable of
being speciﬁed and hence of existing for me only by being the sensation or perception of something—for instance, the sensation of blue or
red, or the perception of the table or the chair. Now blue and red are
not those incommunicable experiences which are mine when I
coincide with them, nor are the table and the chair those short-lived
appearances which are dependent on my gaze. The object is made
determinate as an identiﬁable being only through a whole open series
of possible experiences, and exists only for a subject who carries out
this identiﬁcation. Being is exclusively for someone who is able to step
back from it and thus stand wholly outside being. In this way the mind
becomes the subject of perception and the notion of ‘signiﬁcance’
becomes inconceivable. If seeing or hearing involved extricating oneself from the impression in order to lay siege to it in thought, ceasing,
that is, to be in order to know, then it would be ridiculous to say that I
see with my eyes or hear with my ears, for my eyes and ears are

sense experience

themselves entities in the world and as such are quite incapable of
maintaining on the hither side of it that area of subjectivity from which
it is seen or heard. Even by making them instruments of my perception
I cannot ensure that my eyes and ears retain any cognitive power, for
the notion of perception is ambiguous: they are instruments of bodily
excitation only, and not of perception itself. There is no middle term
between in itself and for itself, and since my senses, being several, are not
myself, they can be only objects. I say that my eyes see, that my hand
touches, that my foot is aching, but these naïve expressions do not put
into words my true experience. Already they provide me with an interpretation of that experience which detaches it from its original subject.
Because I know that the light strikes my eyes, that contact is made by
the skin, that my shoe hurts my foot, I distribute through my body
perceptions which really belong to my soul, and put perception into
the thing perceived. But that is merely the spatial and temporal furrow
left by the acts of consciousness. If I consider them from the inside, I
ﬁnd one single, unlocalized knowledge, one single indivisible soul, and
there is no such diﬀerence between thinking and perceiving as there is
between seeing and hearing. Can we remain within this perspective? If
it is true that I do not see with my eyes, how can I ever have been
ignorant of this truth? Perhaps I did not know what I was saying, or
perhaps I had not thought about it. But how could I not have thought
about it? How could the scrutiny of my mind, how could the working
of my own thought be concealed from me, since by deﬁnition my
thought is for itself? If reﬂection is to justify itself as reﬂection, that is
to say, as progress towards the truth, it must not merely put one view
of the world in place of another, it must show us how the naïve view of
the world is included in and transcended by the sophisticated one.
Reﬂection must elucidate the unreﬂective view which it supersedes,
and show the possibility of this latter, in order to comprehend itself as a
beginning. To say that it is still myself who conceive myself as situated
in a body and furnished with ﬁve senses is clearly a purely verbal
solution, since I who reﬂect cannot recognize myself in this embodied
I, since therefore embodiment remains in the nature of the case an
illusion, and since the possibility of this illusion remains incomprehensible. We must re-examine the dilemma of for itself and in itself,
which involved putting ‘signiﬁcances’ back into the world of objects

247

248 phenomenology of perception
and freeing subjectivity, as absolute non-being, of any kind of inherence in the body. This is what we are doing when we deﬁne sensation
as co-existence or communion. The sensation of blue is not the knowledge or positing of a certain identiﬁable quale throughout all the
experiences of it which I have, as the geometer’s circle is the same in
Paris and Tokyo. It is in all probability intentional, which means that it
does not rest in itself as does a thing, but that it is directed and has
signiﬁcance beyond itself. But what it aims at is recognized only
blindly, through my body’s familiarity with it. It is not constituted in
the full light of day, it is reconstituted or taken up once more by a
knowledge which remains latent, leaving it with its opacity and its
thisness. Sensation is intentional because I ﬁnd that in the sensible a
certain rhythm of existence is put forward—abduction or adduction—
and that, following up this hint, and stealing into the form of existence
which is thus suggested to me, I am brought into relation with an
external being, whether it be in order to open myself to it or to shut
myself oﬀ from it. If the qualities radiate around them a certain mode
of existence, if they have the power to cast a spell and what we called
just now a sacramental value, this is because the sentient subject does
not posit them as objects, but enters into a sympathetic relation with
them, makes them his own and ﬁnds in them his momentary law.
Let us be more explicit. The sensor and the sensible do not stand in
relation to each other as two mutually external terms, and sensation is
not an invasion of the sensor by the sensible. It is my gaze which
subtends colour, and the movement of my hand which subtends the
object’s form, or rather my gaze pairs oﬀ with colour, and my hand
with hardness and softness, and in this transaction between the subject
of sensation and the sensible it cannot be held that one acts while the
other suﬀers the action, or that one confers signiﬁcance on the other.
Apart from the probing of my eye or my hand, and before my body
synchronizes with it, the sensible is nothing but a vague beckoning. ‘If
a subject tries to experience a speciﬁc colour, blue for example, while
trying to take up the bodily attitude appropriate to red, an inner conﬂict results, a sort of spasm which stops as soon as he adopts the bodily
attitude corresponding to blue.’14 Thus a sensible datum which is on
14

Werner, Untersuchungen über Empﬁndung und Empﬁnden, I, p. 158.

sense experience

the point of being felt sets a kind of muddled problem for my body to
solve. I must ﬁnd the attitude which will provide it with the means of
becoming determinate, of showing up as blue; I must ﬁnd the reply to
a question which is obscurely expressed. And yet I do so only when I
am invited by it, my attitude is never suﬃcient to make me really see
blue or really touch a hard surface. The sensible gives back to me what
I lent to it, but this is only what I took from it in the ﬁrst place. As I
contemplate the blue of the sky I am not set over against it as an acosmic
subject; I do not possess it in thought, or spread out towards it some
idea of blue such as might reveal the secret of it, I abandon myself to it
and plunge into this mystery, it ‘thinks itself within me’,* I am the sky
itself as it is drawn together and uniﬁed, and as it begins to exist for
itself; my consciousness is saturated with this limitless blue. But, it may
be retorted, the sky is not mind and there is surely no sense in saying
that it exists for itself. It is indeed true that the geographer’s or the
astronomer’s sky does not exist for itself. But of the sky, as it is perceived or sensed, subtended by my gaze which ranges over and resides
in it, and providing as it does the theatre of a certain living pulsation
adopted by my body, it can be said that it exists for itself, in the sense
that it is not made up of mutually exclusive parts, that each part of the
whole is ‘sensitive’ to what happens in all the others, and ‘knows them
dynamically’.15 As for the subject of sensation, he need not be a pure
nothingness with no terrestrial weight. That would be necessary only
if, like constituting consciousness, he had to be simultaneously omnipresent, coextensive with being, and in process of thinking universal
truth. But the spectacle perceived does not partake of pure being. Taken
exactly as I see it, it is a moment of my individual history, and since
sensation is a reconstitution, it pre-supposes in me sediments left
behind by some previous constitution, so that I am, as a sentient subject, a repository stocked with natural powers at which I am the ﬁrst to
be ﬁlled with wonder. I am not, therefore, in Hegel’s phrase, ‘a hole in

being’, but a hollow, a fold, which has been made and which can be
unmade.16
We must stress this point. How have we managed to escape from the
dilemma of the for itself and the in itself, how can perceptual consciousness be saturated with its object, how can we distinguish sensible
consciousness from intellectual consciousness? Because: (1) Every perception takes place in an atmosphere of generality and is presented to
us anonymously. I cannot say that I see the blue of the sky in the sense
in which I say that I understand a book or again in which I decide to
devote my life to mathematics. My perception, even when seen from
the inside, expresses a given situation: I can see blue because I am
sensitive to colours, whereas personal acts create a situation: I am a
mathematician because I have decided to be one. So, if I wanted to
render precisely the perceptual experience, I ought to say that one perceives in me, and not that I perceive. Every sensation carries within it
the germ of a dream or depersonalization such as we experience in that
quasi-stupor to which we are reduced when we really try to live at the
level of sensation. It is true that knowledge teaches me that sensation
would not occur unless my body were in some way adapted to it, for
example, that there would be no speciﬁc contact unless I moved my
hand. But this activity takes place on the periphery of my being. I am no
more aware of being the true subject of my sensation than of my birth
or my death. Neither my birth nor my death can appear to me as
experiences of my own, since, if I thought of them thus, I should be
assuming myself to be pre-existent to, or outliving, myself, in order to
be able to experience them, and I should therefore not be genuinely
thinking of my birth or my death. I can, then, apprehend myself only as
‘already born’ and ‘still alive’—I can apprehend my birth and my death
only as prepersonal horizons: I know that people are born and die, but
I cannot know my own birth and death. Each sensation, being strictly
speaking, the ﬁrst, last and only one of its kind, is a birth and a death.
The subject who experiences it begins and ends with it, and as he can
neither precede nor survive himself, sensation necessarily appears to
itself in a setting of generality, its origin is anterior to myself, it arises
16

We have pointed out elsewhere that consciousness seen from outside cannot be a pure
for itself (La Structure du Comportement, pp. 168 and ﬀ.). We are beginning to see that the same
applies to consciousness seen from the inside.

sense experience

from sensibility which has preceded it and which will outlive it, just as
my birth and death belong to a natality and a mortality which are
anonymous. By means of sensation I am able to grasp, on the fringe of
my own personal life and acts, a life of given consciousness from
which these latter emerge, the life of my eyes, hands and ears, which
are so many natural selves. Each time I experience a sensation, I feel that
it concerns not my own being, the one for which I am responsible and
for which I make decisions, but another self which has already sided
with the world, which is already open to certain of its aspects and
synchronized with them. Between my sensation and myself there
stands always the thickness of some primal acquisition which prevents my
experience from being clear of itself. I experience the sensation as a
modality of a general existence, one already destined for a physical
world and which runs through me without my being the cause of it.
(2) Sensation can be anonymous only because it is incomplete. The
person who sees and the one who touches is not exactly myself,
because the visible and the tangible worlds are not the world in its
entirety. When I see an object, I always feel that there is a portion of
being beyond what I see at this moment, not only as regards visible
being, but also as regards what is tangible or audible. And not only
sensible being, but a depth of the object that no progressive sensory
deduction will ever exhaust. In a corresponding way, I am not myself
wholly in these operations, they remain marginal. They occur out in
front of me, for the self which sees or the self which hears is in some
way a specialized self, familiar with only one sector of being, and
it is precisely for this reason that eye and hand are able to guess the
movement which will ﬁx the perception, thus displaying that
fore-knowledge which gives them an involuntary appearance.
We may summarize these two ideas by saying that any sensation
belongs to a certain ﬁeld. To say that I have a visual ﬁeld is to say that by
reason of my position I have access to and an opening upon a system of
beings, visible beings, that these are at the disposal of my gaze in virtue
of a kind of primordial contract and through a gift of nature, with no
eﬀort made on my part; from which it follows that vision is prepersonal. And it follows at the same time that it is always limited, that
around what I am looking at at a given moment is spread a horizon of
things which are not seen, or which are even invisible. Vision is a

251

252 phenomenology of perception
thought subordinated to a certain ﬁeld, and this is what is called a sense. When I
say that I have senses and that they give me access to the world, I am not
the victim of some muddle, I do not confuse causal thinking and
reﬂection, I merely express this truth which forces itself upon reﬂection taken as a whole: that I am able, being connatural with the world,
to discover a sense in certain aspects of being without having myself
endowed them with it through any constituting operation.
The distinction between the diﬀerent senses ﬁnds its justiﬁcation
along with that between the senses and intellection. Intellectualism
does not talk about the senses because for it sensations and senses
appear only when I turn back to the concrete act of knowledge in order
to analyse it. I then distinguish in it a contingent matter and a necessary
form, but matter is an unreal phase and not a separable element of the
total act. Therefore there are not the senses, but only consciousness. For
example, intellectualism declines to state the notorious problem of the
contribution of the senses to the experience of space, because sensible
qualities and the senses, as materials of knowledge, cannot possess
space in their own right, for it is the form of objectivity in general, and
in particular the means whereby any consciousness of quality becomes
possible. A sensation would be no sensation at all if it were not the
sensation of something, and ‘things’ in the most general sense of the
word, for example speciﬁc qualities, stand out from the amorphous
mass of impressions only if the latter is put into perspective and coordinated by space. Thus all senses are spatial if they are to give us
access to some form or other of being, if, that is, they are senses at all.
And, by the same necessity, they must all open on the same space,
otherwise the sensory beings with which they bring us into communication would exist only for the relevant sense—like ghosts which
appear only by night—they would lack fullness of being and we could
not be truly conscious of them, that is to say, posit them as true beings.
Empiricism could not ﬁnd facts to refute this deduction. If for example
we desire to show that the sense of touch is not spatial by itself, if we
try, in cases of real or psychic blindness, to discover a pure tactile
experience, and to prove that its articulation owes nothing to space,
these experimental proofs pre-suppose what they are meant to establish. How are we to know in fact whether blindness and psychic blindness have abstracted from the patient’s experience the merely ‘visual

sense experience

data’, and whether they have not also aﬀected the structure of his tactile
experience? Empiricism takes the former hypothesis for granted,
which fact alone makes it possible for its assumption to be regarded as
crucial, but which equally involves postulating the separation of the
senses, which is precisely what has to be proved. To be more precise: if
I admit that space belongs primarily to sight and that from sight it is
transmitted to touch and the other senses, then since there is in the
adult, to all appearances, a tactile perception of space, I must at least
concede that the ‘pure tactile data’ are displaced and overlaid by an
experience having its source in sight, and that they become integrated
into a total experience in which they are ultimately indiscernible. But
then what justiﬁcation is there for distinguishing, within this adult
experience, a ‘tactile’ contribution? Is not the alleged ‘purely tactile’,
which I try to extract by investigating blindness, a highly particularized
kind of experience, which has nothing in common with the functioning of touch in its wholeness, and which cannot give any help in the
analysis of integrated experience? No conclusions about the spatiality
of the senses by the inductive method and by adducing ‘facts’ (for
example, a sense of touch without space in the case of the blind man)
can be drawn, for this fact needs to be interpreted, and it will indeed be
interpreted as a signiﬁcant fact which brings to light the distinctive
nature of touch, or as an accidental fact showing the peculiar properties
of touch when modiﬁed by some disorder, according to the notion
entertained of the senses in general and of their relations to each other
within total consciousness. The problem belongs to the domain of
reﬂection and not to that of experiment as the empiricist understands
it, which is also as scientists understand it when they dream of an
absolute objectivity. There is therefore reason for holding a priori that all
the senses are spatial, and the question which is the one which presents
us with space must be considered unintelligible if we reﬂect on just
what a sense is. Two sorts of reﬂection, however, are possible here.
One—intellectualist reﬂection—thematizes the object and consciousness, and, to use a Kantian expression, it ‘leads them to the concept’.
The object then becomes what is, and consequently what is for everybody and for ever (even if only as a ﬂeeting episode, yet of which it will
for ever be true to say that it existed at an objective moment of time).
Consciousness, thematized by reﬂection, is existence for itself. And,

253

254 phenomenology of perception
with the help of this idea of consciousness and this other idea of object,
it is easily shown that every sensible quality is fully an object only in
the context of universal relations, and that there can be sensation only
on condition that it exists for a central and unique I. If we wished to
call a halt in the reﬂective process, and talk, for example, about a partial
consciousness or an isolated object, we should then have a consciousness which in some respect did not know itself and which would
therefore not be consciousness at all, and an object which would not be
accessible from everywhere, and which to this extent would not be an
object. But we may always inquire of intellectualism whence it derives
this idea or this essence of consciousness and of the object. If the
subject is pure for itself, ‘the I think must be able to accompany all our
representations’. ‘If a world must be capable of being thought’, quality
must contain it in embryo. But in the ﬁrst place by what means do we
know that there is any pure for itself, and where do we learn that the
world must be capable of being thought? The reply will perhaps be that
that is the deﬁnition of subject and world and that, short of understanding them in this way, we no longer know what we are talking
about when we speak of them. And indeed, at the level of constituted
speech, such is in fact the signiﬁcance of world and subject. But from
where do the words themselves derive their sense? Radical reﬂection is
what takes hold of me as I am in the act of forming and formulating the
ideas of subject and object, and brings to light the source of these two
ideas; it is reﬂection, not only in operation, but conscious of itself in
operation. It will perhaps be replied that analytical reﬂection does not
merely grasp subject and object ‘as an idea’, but that it is an experience,
that by reﬂecting I put myself back inside that subject without ﬁnite
limits, that I was before, and put back the object among the relations
which previously subtended it. Finally that there is no reason to ask
whence I derive these ideas of subject and object, since they are simply
the formulation of those conditions without which nothing would
exist for anybody. But the reﬂective I diﬀers from the unreﬂective at
least in having been thematized, and what is given is not consciousness
or pure being; it is, as Kant himself profoundly put it, experience, in
other words the communication of a ﬁnite subject with an opaque
being from which it emerges but to which it remains committed. It is
‘pure and, in a way, still mute experience which it is a question of

sense experience

bringing to the pure expression of its own signiﬁcance’.17 We have the
experience of a world, not understood as a system of relations which
wholly determine each event, but as an open totality the synthesis of
which is inexhaustible. We have the experience of an I not in the sense
of an absolute subjectivity, but indivisibly demolished and remade by
the course of time. The unity of either the subject or the object is not a
real unity, but a presumptive unity on the horizon of experience. We
must rediscover, as anterior to the ideas of subject and object, the fact
of my subjectivity and the nascent object, that primordial layer at
which both things and ideas come into being. As far as consciousness is
concerned, I can arrive at a notion of it only by taking myself back in
the ﬁrst place to that consciousness which I am. I must be particularly
careful not to begin by deﬁning the senses; I must instead resume
contact with the sensory life which I live from within. We are not
obliged to endow the world a priori with those conditions in the
absence of which it is unthinkable, for, in order to be thought of, it
must in the ﬁrst place not be outside knowledge, it must exist for me,
that is, be given, and the transcendental aesthetic would be confused
with the transcendental analytic only if I were a God who posits the
world and not a man who ﬁnds himself thrown into it, and who, in
every sense of the word, ‘is wrapped up in it’. We do not therefore
need to follow Kant in his deduction of one single space. The single
space is the indispensable condition for being able to conceive the
plenitude of objectivity, and it is quite true that if I try to thematize
several spaces, they merge into a unity, each one standing in a certain
positional relationship to the others, and therefore amalgamating with
them. But do we know whether plenary objectivity can be conceived?
Whether all perspectives are compossible? Whether they can all be
thematized together somewhere? Do we know whether tactile and
visual experiences can, strictly speaking, be joined without an intersensory experience? Whether my experience and that of another person
can be linked in a single system of intersubjective experience?
There may well be, either in each sensory experience or in each consciousness, ‘phantoms’ which no rational approach can account for.
The whole Transcendental Deduction hangs on the aﬃrmation of a
17

Husserl, Méditations cartésiennes, p. 33.

255

256 phenomenology of perception
complete system of truth. It is precisely to the sources of this aﬃrmation that we must revert if we wish to adopt a reﬂective method. In
this connection we may hold with Husserl18 that Hume went, in intention, further than anyone in radical reﬂection, since he genuinely tried
to take us back to those phenomena of which we have experience, on
the hither side of any formation of ideas,—even though he went on to
dissect and emasculate this experience. The idea of a single space and a
single time, being grounded upon that of a summation of being, which
is precisely what Kant subjected to criticism in the Transcendental
Dialectic, needs in particular to be bracketed and to produce its genealogy from the starting point of our actual experience. This new conception of reﬂection which is the phenomenological conception of it,
amounts in other words to giving a new deﬁnition of the a priori. Kant
has already shown that the a priori is not knowable in advance of experience, that is, outside our horizon of facticity, and that there can be no
question of distinguishing two elements of knowledge: one a priori and
the other a posteriori. In so far as the a priori in his philosophy retains the
character of what must necessarily be, as opposed to what in fact exists and
is determinate in human terms, this is only to the extent that he has not
followed out his programme, which was to deﬁne our cognitive
powers in terms of our factual condition, and which necessarily compelled him to set every conceivable being against the background of
this world. From the moment that experience—that is, the opening on
to our de facto world—is recognized as the beginning of knowledge,
there is no longer any way of distinguishing a level of a priori truths and
one of factual ones, what the world must necessarily be and what it
actually is. The unity of the senses, which was regarded as an a priori
truth, is no longer anything but the formal expression of a fundamental contingency: the fact that we are in the world—the diversity of
the senses, which was regarded as given a posteriori, including the concrete form that it assumes in a human subject, appears as necessary to
this world, to the only world which we can think of consequentially; it
therefore becomes an a priori truth. Every sensation is spatial; we have
adopted this thesis, not because the quality as an object cannot be
thought otherwise than in space, but because, as the primordial contact
18

Formale und Transzendentale Logik, e.g. p. 226.

sense experience

with being, as the assumption by the sentient subject of a form of
existence to which the sensible points, and as the co-existence of sentient and sensible, it is itself constitutive of a setting for co-existence, in
other words, of a space. We say a priori that no sensation is atomic, that
all sensory experience presupposes a certain ﬁeld, hence co-existences,
from which we conclude, against Lachelier, that the blind man has the
experience of a space. But these a priori truths amount to nothing other
than the making explicit of a fact: the fact of the sensory experience as
the assumption of a form of existence. Moreover, this assumption
implies also that I can at each moment absorb myself almost wholly
into the sense of touch or sight, and even that I can never see or touch
without my consciousness becoming thereby in some measure saturated, and losing something of its availability. Thus the unity and the
diversity of the senses are truths of the same order. The a priori is the fact
understood, made explicit, and followed through into all the consequences of its latent logic; the a posteriori is the isolated and implicit
fact. It would be contradictory to assert that the sense of touch is devoid
of spatiality, and it is a priori impossible to touch without touching in
space, since our experience is the experience of a world. But this insertion of the tactile perspective into a universal being does not represent
any necessity external to touch, it comes about spontaneously in the
experience of touching itself, in accordance with its own distinctive
mode. Sensation as it is brought to use by experience is no longer some
inert substance or abstract moment, but one of our surfaces of contact
with being, a structure of consciousness, and in place of one single
space, as the universal condition of all qualities, we have with each one
of the latter, a particular manner of being in space and, in a sense, of
making space. It is neither contradictory nor impossible that each sense
should constitute a small world within the larger one, and it is even in
virtue of its peculiarity that it is necessary to the whole and opens upon
the whole.
To sum up, once distinction between the a priori and the empirical,
between form and content, have been done away with, the spaces
peculiar to the senses become concrete ‘moments’ of a comprehensive
conﬁguration which is the one and only space, and the power of going
to it is inseparable from that of cutting oneself oﬀ from it by the
sequestration of a sense. When, in the concert hall, I open my eyes,

257

258 phenomenology of perception
visible space seems to me cramped compared to that other space
through which, a moment ago, the music was being unfolded, and
even if I keep my eyes open while the piece is being played, I have the
impression that the music is not really contained within this circumscribed and unimpressive space. It brings a new dimension stealing
through visible space, and in this it surges forward, just as, in victims of
hallucinations, the clear space of things perceived is mysteriously
duplicated by a ‘dark space’ in which other presences are possible. Like
the perspective of other people making its impact on the world for me,
the spatial realm of each sense is an unknowable absolute for the
others, and to that extent limits their spatiality. These descriptions,
which to critical philosophy appear as empirical oddities, leaving a
priori certainties untouched, assume, as far as we are concerned, philosophical importance, because the unity of space can be discovered only
in the interplay of the sensory realms. That is what remains true in the
celebrated empiricist description of a non-spatial perception. The
experience of persons blind from birth and operated upon for cataract
has never proved, and could never prove, that for them space begins
with sight. Yet the patient never ceases to marvel at this visual space to
which he has just gained access, and compared to which tactile experience seems to him so poor that he is quite prepared to admit that he
has never enjoyed the experience of space before the operation.19 The
patient’s amazement, and his hesitant attitude in the new visual world
into which he is entering, show that the sense of touch is not spatial as
is sight. ‘After the operation,’ it is said,20 ‘form as given by sight is for
these patients something quite new which they fail to relate to their
tactile experience’, ‘the patient states that he can see, but does not
know what he sees. . . . He never recognizes his hand as such, and talks
19

One subject declares that the spatial notions that he thought he entertained before the
operation did not in fact give him a genuine representation of space, and were only a
species of ‘knowledge gained through the workings of thought’. (Von Senden, Raum- und
Gestaltauﬀassung bei operierten Blindgeborenen vor und nach der Operation, p. 23.) The acquisition of
sight involves a general reorganization of existence which equally concerns touch. The
world’s centre is displaced, the tactile image is forgotten, recognition through touch is
less reliable, the existential current henceforth runs through vision, and what the patient
is talking about is this weakened sense of touch.

sense experience

only about a moving, white patch.’21 To distinguish by sight a circle
from a rectangle, he has to run his eyes round the outline of the ﬁgure,
as he might with his hand,22 and he always tends to take hold of objects
set before his eyes.23 What conclusion is to be drawn from this? that
tactile experience is no preparation for the perception of space? But
unless it were in some way spatial, would the subject stretch out his
hand towards the object shown to him? This gesture presupposes that
touch opens on to a setting at least analogous to that of visual data. The
facts show above all else that sight is nothing unless the subject is more
or less used to using his eyes. Patients ‘at ﬁrst see colours in the way
that we smell an odour: it closes round us, and acts upon us, without
however ﬁlling a determinate form of a determinate extent’.24 Everything is at ﬁrst confused and apparently in motion. Discrimination
between coloured surfaces and the correct apprehension of movement
do not come until later, when the subject has learned ‘what it is to
see’25 that is, when he directs and shifts his gaze as a gaze, and no
longer as a hand. This proves that each organ of sense explores the
object in its own way, that it is the agent of a certain type of synthesis,
but, short of reserving the word space, by way of nominal deﬁnition,
for the visual synthesis, we cannot withhold from the sense of touch
spatiality in the sense of a grasp of co-existences. The very fact that the
way is paved to true vision through a phase of transition and through a
sort of touch eﬀected by the eyes would be incomprehensible unless
there were a quasi-spatial tactile ﬁeld, into which the ﬁrst visual perceptions may be inserted. Sight would never communicate directly
with touch, as it in fact does in the normal adult, if the sense of touch,
even when artiﬁcially isolated, were not so organized as to make coexistences possible. Far from ruling out the idea of a tactile space, the
facts prove on the contrary that there is a space so strictly tactile that its
articulations do not and never will stand in a relationship of synonymity with those of visual space. Empiricist analyses present, in a confused

form, a genuine problem. The fact, for example, that touch cannot
simultaneously cover more than a small amount of space—that of the
body and its instruments—does not aﬀect merely the presentation of
tactile space, but also changes its signiﬁcance. For the intelligence—or
at least for a certain intelligence which is that of classical physics—
simultaneity is the same, whether it occurs between two adjacent
points or two remote ones, and in any case it is possible gradually to
construct with short-distance simultaneities a long-distance one. But
for experience, the thickness of time which thus intrudes into the
operation aﬀects the result, producing a certain ‘blurring’ in the simultaneity of the extreme points, and to this extent the breadth of visual
perspectives will be a true revelation to the patient whose blindness has
been cured by operation, because it provides a demonstration, for the
ﬁrst time, of remote simultaneity itself. These patients declare that tactile
objects are not genuine spatial totalities, that the apprehension of the
object is here a mere ‘knowledge of the mutual relation of parts’, that
the circle and the square are not really perceived by touch, but recognized from certain ‘signs’—the presence or absence of ‘corners’.26 We
conclude that the tactile ﬁeld has never the fullness of the visual, that
the tactile object is never wholly present in each of its parts as is the
case with the visual object, and in short that touching is not seeing. It is
true that the blind and the normal person talk to each other, and that it
is perhaps impossible to ﬁnd a single word, even in colour vocabulary,
to which the blind man does not manage to attach at least a rough
meaning. One blind boy of twelve gives a very good deﬁnition of the
dimensions of sight: ‘Those who can see,’ he says, ‘are related to me
through some unknown sense which completely envelops me from a
distance, follows me, goes through me, and, from the time I get up to
the time I go to bed, holds me in some way in subjection to it’ (mich
gewissermassen beherrscht).27 But such indications remain theoretical
and problematic for the blind person. They ask a question to which
only sight could provide an answer. And this is why the blind person,
having undergone his operation, ﬁnds the world diﬀerent from what
26

Von Senden, Raum- und Gestaltauﬀassung bei operierten Blindgeborenen vor und nach der Operation,
p. 29.
27
Ibid., p. 45.

sense experience

he expected,28 as we always ﬁnd a man diﬀerent from what we have
heard about him. The blind man’s world diﬀers from the normal
person’s not only through the quantity of material at his disposal, but
also through the structure of the whole. A blind man knows quite
precisely through his sense of touch what branches and leaves, or an
arm and ﬁngers, are. After the operation he marvels that there should
be ‘such a diﬀerence’ between a tree and a human body.29 It is clear
that sight has not only added fresh details to his knowledge of the
tree. What we are dealing with is a mode of presentation and a type of
synthesis which are new and which transﬁgure the object. If we take
as an example the structure ‘light-illuminated object’ we shall ﬁnd
only somewhat vague analogies in the realms of touch. This is why a
patient operated upon after being blind for eighteen years tries to
touch a ray of sunlight.30 The whole signiﬁcance of our life—from
which theoretical signiﬁcance is merely extracted—would be diﬀerent
if we were sightless. There is a general function of substitution and
replacement which enables us to gain access to the abstract signiﬁcance of experiences which we have not actually had, for example, to
speak of what we have not seen. But just as in the organism the
renewed functions are never the exact equivalent of the damaged
ones, and give only an appearance of total restitution, the intelligence
ensures no more than an apparent communication between diﬀerent
experiences, and the synthesis of visual and tactile worlds in the person born blind and operated upon, the constitution of an intersensory
world must be eﬀected in the domain of sense itself, the community
of signiﬁcance between the two experiences being inadequate to
ensure their union in one single experience. The senses are distinct
from each other and distinct from intellection in so far as each one of
them brings with it a structure of being which can never be exactly
transposed. We can recognize this because we have rejected any formalism of consciousness, and made the body the subject of
perception.
And we can recognize it without any threat to the unity of the senses.

For the senses communicate with each other. Music is not in visible
space, but it besieges, undermines and displaces that space, so that soon
these overdressed listeners who take on a judicial air and exchange
remarks or smiles, unaware that the ﬂoor is trembling beneath their
feet, are like a ship’s crew buﬀeted about on the surface of a tempestuous sea. The two spaces are distinguishable only against the background of a common world, and can compete with each other only
because they both lay claim to total being. They are united at the very
instant in which they clash. If I try to shut myself up in one of my
senses and, for instance, project myself wholly into my eyes, and abandon myself to the blue of the sky, soon I am unaware that I am gazing
and, just as I strive to make myself sight and nothing but sight, the sky
stops being a ‘visual perception’, to become my world of the moment.
Sensory experience is unstable, and alien to natural perception, which
we achieve with our whole body all at once, and which opens on a
world of inter-acting senses. Like that of the sensible quality, the
experience of the separate ‘senses’ is gained only when one assumes a
highly particularized attitude, and this cannot be of any assistance to
the analysis of direct consciousness. I am sitting in my room, and I look
at the sheets of white paper lying about on the table, some in the light
shed through the window, others in the shadow. If I do not analyse my
perception but content myself with the spectacle as a whole, I shall say
that all the sheets of paper look equally white. However, some of them
are in the shadow of the wall. How is it that they are not less white than
the rest? I decide to look more closely. I ﬁx my gaze upon them, which
means that I restrict my visual ﬁeld. I may even look at them through a
match-box lid, which will separate them from the rest of the ﬁeld, or
through a ‘reduction screen’ with a window in it. Whether I use one of
these devices or merely observe with the naked eye, provided that in
the latter case I assume the ‘analytic attitude’,31 the sheets change their
appearance: this is no longer white paper over which a shadow is cast,
but a grey or steely blue substance, thick and not deﬁnitely localized. If
I once more look at the general picture, I notice that the sheets over
which a shadow is thrown were at no time identical with the sheets
lying in the light, nor yet were they objectively diﬀerent from them.
31

sense experience

The whiteness of the shaded paper does not lend itself to precise classiﬁcation within the black-white range.32 It appeared as no deﬁnite
quality, and I have brought out the quality by ﬁxing my eyes on a
portion of the visual ﬁeld: then and then only have I found myself
before a certain quale which absorbs my gaze. Now what actually is
ﬁxing one’s gaze? From the point of view of the object, it is separating
the region under scrutiny from the rest of the ﬁeld, it is interrupting
the total life of the spectacle, which assigned to each visible surface a
determinate coloration, taking the light into account; from the subject’s point of view, it is substituting for the comprehensive vision, in
which our gaze lends itself to the whole spectacle and is permeated by
it, an observation, that is, a localized vision which it controls according
to its own requirements. The sensible quality, far from being coextensive with perception, is the peculiar product of an attitude of
curiosity or observation. It appears when, instead of yielding up the
whole of my gaze to the world, I turn towards this gaze itself, and
when I ask myself what precisely it is that I see; it does not occur in the
natural transactions between my sight and the world, it is the reply to a
certain kind of questioning on the part of my gaze, the outcome of a
second order or critical vision which tries to know itself in its own
particularity, of an ‘attention to the pure visual’,33 which I exercise
either when I am afraid of being mistaken, or when I want to undertake a scientiﬁc study of the spectacle presented. This attitude does
away with the spectacle properly speaking: the colours which I see
through the reduction screen or those obtained by the painter when he
half-closes his eyes are no longer object-colours—the colour of the walls
or the colour of the paper—but coloured areas having a certain density,
and all rather vaguely localized in the same unreal plane.34 Thus there is
a natural attitude of vision in which I make common cause with my
gaze and, through it, surrender myself to the spectacle: in this case the
parts of the ﬁeld are linked in an organization which makes them
recognizable and identiﬁable. The quality, the separate sensory impact
occurs when I break this total structuralization of my vision, when I

cease to adhere to my own gaze, and when, instead of living the vision,
I question myself about it, I want to try out my possibilities, I break the
link between my vision and the world, between myself and my vision,
in order to catch and describe it. When I have taken up this attitude, at
the same time as the world is atomized into sensible qualities, the
natural unity of the perceiving subject is broken up, and I reach the
stage of being unaware of myself as the subject of a visual ﬁeld. Now
just as, within each sense, we must ﬁnd the natural unity which it
oﬀers, we shall reveal a ‘primary layer’ of sense experience which
precedes its division among the separate senses.35 According as I ﬁx my
eyes on an object or allow them to wander, or else wholly submit
myself to the event, the same colour appears to me as superﬁcial
(Oberﬂächenfarbe)—being in a deﬁnite location in space, and extending
over an object—or else it becomes an atmospheric colour (Raumfarbe)
and diﬀuses itself all round the object. Or I may feel it in my eye as a
vibration of my gaze; or ﬁnally it may pass on to my body a similar
manner of being, fully pervading me, so that it is no longer entitled to
be called a colour. Similarly there is an objective sound which reverberates outside me in the instrument, an atmospheric sound which is
between the object and my body, a sound which vibrates in me ‘as if I
had become the ﬂute or the clock’; and ﬁnally a last stage in which the
acoustic element disappears and becomes the highly precise experience
of a change permeating my whole body.36 The sensory experience has
only a narrow margin at its disposal: either the sound and the colour,
through their own arrangement, throw an object into relief, such as an
ashtray or a violin, and this object speaks directly to all the senses; or
else, at the opposite end of experience, the sound and the colour are
received into my body, and it becomes diﬃcult to limit my experience
to a single sensory department: it spontaneously overﬂows towards all
the rest. The sensory experience, at the third stage just described, is
distinguished only by an ‘accent’ which is indicative rather of the
direction of the sound or the colour.37 At this level, the ambiguity
of experience is such that an audible rhythm causes cinematograph

pictures to run together and produces a perception of movement
whereas, without auditory support, the same succession of images
would be too slow to give rise to stroboscopic movement.38 The
sounds modify the consecutive images of the colours: a louder note
intensiﬁes them, the interruption of the sound produces a wavering
eﬀect in them, and a low note makes blue darker or deeper.39 The
constancy hypothesis,40 which allows to each stimulus one sensation
and one only, is progressively less veriﬁable as natural perception is
approached. ‘It is in so far as conduct is intellectual and impartial
(sächlicher) that the constancy hypothesis becomes acceptable as regards
the relation of stimulus to speciﬁc sensory response, and that the auditory stimulus, for instance, is limited to its speciﬁc sphere, in this case
the acoustic one.’41 The inﬂuence of mescalin, by weakening the attitude of impartiality and surrendering the subject to his vitality, should
therefore favour forms of synaesthetic experience. And indeed, under
mescalin, the sound of a ﬂute gives a bluish-green colour, the tick of a
metronome, in darkness, is translated as grey patches, the spatial intervals between them corresponding to the intervals of time between the
ticks, the size of the patch to the loudness of the tick, and its height to
the pitch of the sound.42 A subject under mescalin ﬁnds a piece of iron,
strikes the window-sill with it and exclaims: ‘This is magic’; the trees
are growing greener.43 The barking of a dog is found to attract light in
an indescribable way, and is re-echoed in the right foot.44 It is as if one
could sometimes see ‘the occasional collapse of the barriers established, in the course of evolution, between the senses.45 Seen in the
perspective of the objective world, with its opaque qualities, and the
objective body with its separate organs, the phenomenon of synaesthetic experience is paradoxical. The attempt is therefore made to
explain it independently of the concept of sensation: it is thought

necessary, for example, to suppose that the excitations ordinarily
restricted to one region of the brain—the optical or auditory zone—
become capable of playing a part outside these limits, and that in this
way a speciﬁc quality is associated with a non-speciﬁc one. Whether or
not this explanation is supported by arguments drawn from brain
physiology,46 this explanation does not account for synaesthetic
experience, which thus becomes one more occasion for questioning
the concept of sensation and objective thought. For the subject does not say
only that he has the sensation both of a sound and a colour: it is the sound itself that he
sees where colours are formed.47 This formulation is literally meaningless if
vision is deﬁned by the visual quale, and the sound by the acoustic quale.
But it rests with us to word our deﬁnition in such a way as to provide it
with a meaning, since the sight of sounds and the hearing of colours
exist as phenomena. Nor are these even exceptional phenomena. Synaesthetic perception is the rule, and we are unaware of it only because
scientiﬁc knowledge shifts the centre of gravity of experience, so that
we have unlearned how to see, hear, and generally speaking, feel, in
order to deduce, from our bodily organization and the world as the
physicist conceives it, what we are to see, hear and feel.
Sight, it is said, can bring us only colours or lights, and with them
forms which are the outlines of colours, and movements which are the
patches of colour changing position. But how shall we place transparency or ‘muddy’ colours in the scale? In reality, each colour, in its
inmost depths, is nothing but the inner structure of the thing overtly
revealed. The brilliance of gold palpably holds out to us its homogeneous composition, and the dull colour of wood its heterogeneous
make-up.48 The senses intercommunicate by opening on to the structure of the thing. One sees the hardness and brittleness of glass, and
46

It is for example possible that under mescalin a modiﬁcation of the chronaxies might
be observable. This fact would in no way count as an explanation of synaesthesia in terms
of the objective body, if, as we shall show, the juxtaposition of several sensible qualities
fails to make clear to us perceptual ambivalence as it is presented to us in synaesthetic
experience. The change in the chronaxies could not be the cause of synaesthesia, but the
objective expression or sign of a more profound and all-embracing event, which has no
seat in the objective body, but which is relevant to the phenomenal body as a vehicle of
being in the world.

when, with a tinkling sound, it breaks, this sound is conveyed by the
visible glass.49 One sees the springiness of steel, the ductility of red-hot
steel, the hardness of a plane blade, the softness of shavings. The form
of objects is not their geometrical shape: it stands in a certain relation
to their speciﬁc nature, and appeals to all our other senses as well as
sight. The form of a fold in linen or cotton shows us the resilience or
dryness of the ﬁbre, the coldness or warmth of the material. Furthermore, the movement of visible objects is not the mere transference
from place to place of coloured patches which, in the visual ﬁeld,
correspond to those objects. In the jerk of the twig from which a bird
has just ﬂown, we read its ﬂexibility or elasticity, and it is thus that a
branch of an apple-tree or a birch are immediately distinguishable. One
sees the weight of a block of cast iron which sinks in the sand, the
ﬂuidity of water and the viscosity of syrup.50 In the same way, I hear
the hardness and unevenness of cobbles in the rattle of a carriage, and
we speak appropriately of a ‘soft’, ‘dull’ or ‘sharp’ sound. Though one
may doubt whether the sense of hearing brings us genuine ‘things’, it
is at least certain that it presents us, beyond the sounds in space, with
something which ‘murmurs’, and in this way communicates with the
other senses.51 Finally, if, with my eyes closed, I bend a steel bar and a
lime branch, I perceive in my hands the most essential texture of the
metal and the wood. If, then, taken as incomparable qualities, the ‘data
of the diﬀerent senses’ belong to so many separate worlds, each one in
its particular essence being a manner of modulating the thing, they all
communicate through their signiﬁcant core.
We must, however, give a clearer account of the nature of sensible
signiﬁcance, otherwise we shall merely slip back into the intellectualist
analysis which we rejected earlier. The table which I touch is the same
one as the table which I see. But must one go on to say, as has in fact
been said: the sonata which I hear is the same one as Helen Keller
touches, and the man I see is the same one as the blind painter paints?52

diﬀerence between the perceptual and the intellectual syntheses. The
unity of the senses would then be of the same order as the unity of the
objects of science. When I both touch and look at an object, it would be
said, the single object is the common ground of these two appearances
as Venus is the common ground of the Morning Star and the Evening
Star, and so perception would be an incipient science.53 Now, though
perception brings together our sensory experiences into a single
world, it does not do so in the way that scientiﬁc colligation gathers
together objects or phenomena, but in the way that binocular vision
grasps one sole object. Let us describe carefully this ‘synthesis’. When
my gaze is ﬁxed on a remote thing, I have a double image of objects
nearby. When I transfer my gaze to the latter, I see the two images
converge on what is to be the single object, and merge into it. We must
not at this point say that the synthesis consists in thinking of them
together as images of one single object; if we were dealing with a
mental act or an apperception, this ought to occur as soon as I notice
the identity of the two images, whereas I have to wait much longer for
the unity of the object to appear: until the moment when correct
focusing does away with them. The single object is not a certain way of
thinking of the two images, since they cease to be given the moment it
appears. Has the ‘fusion of images’ been eﬀected, then, by some innate
device of the nervous system, and do we mean that ﬁnally we have, if
not on the periphery, at least at the centre, a single excitation mediated
by the two eyes? But the mere existence of one visual centre cannot
explain the single object, since double vision sometimes occurs, as
moreover the mere existence of two retinas cannot explain double
vision, since it is not a constant phenomenon.54 If double vision as well
as the single object can be included in normal vision, this is not attributable to the anatomical lay-out of the visual apparatus, but to its
functioning and to the use which the psychosomatic subject makes of
it. Shall we then say that double sight occurs because our eyes do not

Alain, 81 Chapitres sur l’Esprit et les Passions, p. 38.
‘The convergence of the conductors as it exists does not condition the non-distinction
of images in simple binocular vision, since a rivalry between the monocular visions can
take place, and the separation of the retinas does not account for their distinction when it
occurs, since, normally, when nothing varies in receptor and conductors, this distinction
is not made.’ R. Déjean, Etude psychologique de la distance dans la vision, p. 74.

converge on the object, and because it throws non-symmetrical images
on our two retinas? And that these two images merge into one because
ﬁxation brings them back to corresponding points on the two retinas?
But are divergence and convergence of the eyes the cause or the eﬀect
of double and normal vision? In the case of people born blind and
operated on for cataract, it is impossible to say, during the period
following the operation, whether it is non-co-ordination of the eyes
which hampers vision, or whether it is the confusion in the visual ﬁeld
which favours non-co-ordination—whether they fail to see through
failure to focus, or whether they fail to focus through not having anything to see. When I focus on the remote distance and, for example,
one of my ﬁngers held near my eyes throws its image on nonsymmetrical points on my retinas, the arrangement of images on the
retinas cannot be the cause of the action of focusing which will put an
end to the double vision. For, as has been pointed out,55 the disappearance of images does not exist in itself. My ﬁnger forms its image on a
certain area of my left retina, and on an area of my right retina which is
not symmetrical with the former. But the symmetrical area of the right
retina is also full of visual excitations, the distribution of stimuli on the
two retinas is ‘dissymmetrical’ only to a subject who compares the two
groupings and identiﬁes them. On the retinas themselves, considered
as objects, there are only two groupings of stimuli that cannot be compared. It will perhaps be replied that, unless the eyes are focused, these
two groupings cannot be superimposed on each other, nor give rise to
the vision of anything, and that in this sense their presence alone
creates a state of unbalance. But this is admitting what we are trying to
show: that the sight of one single object is not a simple outcome of
focusing the eyes, that it is anticipated in the very act of focusing, or
that, as has been stated, the focusing of the gaze is a ‘prospective
activity’.56 For my gaze to alight on near objects and to focus my eyes
on them, it must experience double vision as an unbalance57 or as an

It is known that Gestalt psychology bases this orientated process on some physical

imperfect vision, and tend towards the single object as towards the
release of tension and the completion of vision. ‘It is necessary to
“look” in order to see.’58 The unity of the object in binocular vision is
not, therefore, the result of some third person process which eventually
produces a single image through the fusion of two monocular images.
When we go from diplopia to normal vision, the single object replaces
the two images, one is clearly not superimposed on the other: it is not
of the same order as they, but is incomparably more substantial. The
two images of diplopia are not amalgamated into one single one in
binocular vision; the unity of the object is intentional. But—and this is
the point we are trying to make—it is not therefore a notional unity.
We pass from double vision to the single object, not through an inspection of the mind, but when the two eyes cease to function each on its
own account and are used as a single organ by one single gaze. It is not
the epistemological subject who brings about the synthesis, but the
body, when it escapes from dispersion, pulls itself together and tends
by all means in its power towards one single goal of its activity, and
when one single intention is formed in it through the phenomenon of
synergy. We withdraw this synthesis from the objective body only to
transfer it to the phenomenal body, the body, that is, in so far as it
projects a certain ‘setting’ round itself,59 in so far as its ‘parts’ are
dynamically acquainted with each other, and its receptors are so
arranged as to make possible, through their synergy, the perception of
the object. What is meant by saying that this intentionality is not a
thought is that it does not come into being through the transparency of
any consciousness, but takes for granted all the latent knowledge of
itself that my body possesses. Being supported by the prelogical unity
of the bodily schema, the perceptual synthesis no more holds the secret
of the object than it does that of one’s own body, and this is why the
perceived object always presents itself as transcendent, and why the
all in terms of some of their number, in this case physical forms. The focus as a temporal
form is not a physical or physiological fact for the simple reason that all the forms belong
to the phenomenal world. Cf. on this point La Structure du Comportement, pp. 175 and ﬀ., 191

synthesis seems to be eﬀected on the object itself, in the world, and not
at that metaphysical point which the thinking subject is. Herein lies the
distinction between the perceptual synthesis and the intellectual. On
passing from double to normal vision, I am not simply aware of seeing
with my two eyes the same object, I am aware of progressing towards the
object itself and ﬁnally enjoying its concrete presence. Monocular
images ﬂoat vaguely in front of things, having no real place in the world;
then suddenly they fall back towards a certain location in the world and
are swallowed up in it, as ghosts, at daybreak, repair to the rift in the
earth which let them forth. The binocular object, in which the synthesis occurs, absorbs the monocular images, which, in this new light,
ﬁnally recognize themselves as appearances of that object. My set of
experiences is presented as a concordant whole, and the synthesis takes
place not in so far as they all express a certain invariant, and in the
identity of the object, but in that they are all collected together, by the
last of their number, in the ipseity of the thing. The ipseity is, of course,
never reached: each aspect of the thing which falls to our perception is
still only an invitation to perceive beyond it, still only a momentary halt
in the perceptual process. If the thing itself were reached, it would be
from that moment arrayed before us and stripped of its mystery. It
would cease to exist as a thing at the very moment when we thought to
possess it. What makes the ‘reality’ of the thing is therefore precisely
what snatches it from our grasp. The aseity of the thing, its unchallengeable presence and the perpetual absence into which it withdraws,
are two inseparable aspects of transcendence. Intellectualism overlooks
both, and if we want to account for the thing as the transcendent terminus of an open series of experiences, we must provide the subject of
perception with the unity of the bodily schema, which is itself open and
limitless. That is what we learn from the synthesis of binocular vision.
Let us apply it to the problem of the unity of the senses. It cannot be
understood in terms of their subsumption under a primary consciousness, but of their never-ending integration into one knowing organism. The intersensory object is to the visual object what the visual
object is to the monocular images of double vision,60 and the senses

It is true that the senses should not be put on the same basis, as if they were all equally
capable of objectivity and accessible to intentionality. Experience does not present them

interact in perception as the two eyes collaborate in vision. The sight of
sounds or the hearing of colours come about in the same way as the
unity of the gaze through the two eyes: in so far as my body is, not a
collection of adjacent organs, but a synergic system, all the functions of
which are exercised and linked together in the general action of being
in the world, in so far as it is the congealed face of existence. There is a
sense in saying that I see sounds or hear colours so long as sight or
hearing is not the mere possession of an opaque quale, but the experience of a modality of existence, the synchronisation of my body with
it, and the problem of forms of synaesthetic experience begins to look
like being solved if the experience of quality is that of a certain mode
of movement or of a form of conduct. When I say that I see a sound, I
mean that I echo the vibration of the sound with my whole sensory
being, and particularly with that sector of myself which is susceptible
to colours. Movement, understood not as objective movement and
transference in space, but as a project towards movement or ‘potential
movement’61 forms the basis for the unity of the senses. It is fairly well
known that the talking ﬁlm not only adds a sound accompaniment to
the show, but also changes the tenor of the show itself. When I go to
see a ﬁlm ‘dubbed’ in French, I do not merely notice the discrepancy
between word and image, I suddenly have the impression that something
else is being said over there. The ‘dubbed’ text, though it ﬁlls the auditorium and my ears, has not even an auditory existence for me, and I
have ears for nothing but those other soundless words that emanate
from the screen. When a breakdown of sound all at once cuts oﬀ the
voice from a character who nevertheless goes on gesticulating on the
screen, not only does the meaning of his speech suddenly escape me:
the spectacle itself is changed. The face which was so recently alive
to us as equivalent: I think that visual experience is truer than tactile experience, that it
garners within itself its own truth and adds to it, because its richer structure oﬀers me
modalities of being unsuspected by touch. The unity of the senses is achieved transversally, according to their own structure. But something like it is found in binocular
vision, if it is true that we have a ‘directing eye’ which brings the other under its control.
These two facts—the taking over of sensory experiences in general in visual experience,
and that of the functions of one eye by the other—prove that the unity of experience is
not a formal unity, but a primary organization.

thickens and freezes, and looks nonplussed, while the interruption of
the sound invades the screen as a quasi-stupor. For the spectator, the
gestures and words are not subsumed under some ideal signiﬁcance,
the words take up the gesture and the gesture the words, and they
inter-communicate through the medium of my body. Like the sensory
aspects of my body they are immediately and mutually symbolical,
precisely because my body is a ready-made system of equivalents and
transpositions from one sense to another. The senses translate each
other without any need of an interpreter, and are mutually comprehensible without the intervention of any idea. These remarks enable us to
appreciate to the full Herder’s words: ‘Man is a permanent sensorium
commune, who is aﬀected now from one quarter, now from another.’62
With the notion of the bodily schema we ﬁnd that not only is the unity
of the body described in a new way, but also, through this, the unity of
the senses and of the object. My body is the seat or rather the very
actuality of the phenomenon of expression (Ausdruck), and there the
visual and auditory experiences, for example, are pregnant one with
the other, and their expressive value is the ground of the antepredicative unity of the perceived world, and, through it, of verbal expression
(Darstellung) and intellectual signiﬁcance (Bedeutung).63 My body is the
fabric into which all objects are woven, and it is, at least in relation to
the perceived world, the general instrument of my ‘comprehension’.
It is my body which gives signiﬁcance not only to the natural object,
but also to cultural objects like words. If a word is shown to a subject
for too short a time for him to be able to read it, the word ‘warm’, for
example, induces a kind of experience of warmth which surrounds
him with something in the nature of a meaningful halo.64 The word
‘hard’65 produces a sort of stiﬀening of the back and neck, and only in a
secondary way does it project itself into the visual or auditory ﬁeld and
assume the appearance of a sign or a word. Before becoming the indication of a concept it is ﬁrst of all an event which grips my body,
and this grip circumscribes the area of signiﬁcance to which it has

reference. One subject states that on presentation of the word ‘damp’
(feucht), he experiences, in addition to a feeling of dampness and coldness, a whole rearrangement of the bodily schema, as if the inside of
the body came to the periphery, and as if the reality of the body, until
then concentrated into his arms and legs, were in search of a new
balance of its parts. The word is then indistinguishable from the attitude which it induces, and it is only when its presence is prolonged
that it appears in the guise of an external image, and its meaning as a
thought. Words have a physiognomy because we adopt towards them,
as towards each person, a certain form of behaviour which makes its
complete appearance the moment each word is given. ‘I try to grasp
the word rot (red) in its living expression; but at ﬁrst it is no more than
peripheral for me, no more than a sign along with the knowledge of its
meaning. It is not red itself. But suddenly I notice that the word pushes
its way through my body. I have the feeling, diﬃcult to describe, of a
kind of numbed fullness which invades my body, and which at the
same time imparts to my mouth cavity a spherical shape. And, precisely
at that moment, I notice that the word on the paper takes on its expressive value, it comes to meet me in a dark red halo, while the letter o
intuitively presents me with that spherical cavity which I previously felt
in my mouth.’66 What is particularly brought out by the word’s
behaviour here is its indissoluble identity with something said, heard
and seen. ‘The word as read is not a geometrical structure in a segment
of visual space, it is the presentation of a form of behaviour and of a
linguistic act in its dynamic fullness.’67 Whether it is a question of
perceiving words or more generally objects, ‘there is a certain bodily
attitude, a speciﬁc kind of dynamic tension which is necessary to give
structure to the image; man, as a dynamic and living totality has to

Ibid., p. 239. What has been said of the word is even truer of the sentence. Before even
having read through the sentence, we can say that it is ‘journalese’ (ibid., pp. 251–3). We
can understand a phrase or at least give it a certain meaning by going from the whole to
the parts. Not, as Bergson says, because we evolve a ‘hypothesis’ on the strength of the
ﬁrst words, but because we have an organ of language which takes on the linguistic shape
of what is set before it, as our organs of sense are given a direction by the stimulus and
are synchronized with it.

“pattern” himself in order to trace out a ﬁgure in his visual ﬁeld as part
of the psychosomatic organism’.68 In short, my body is not only an
object among all other objects, a nexus of sensible qualities among
others, but an object which is sensitive to all the rest, which reverberates
to all sounds, vibrates to all colours, and provides words with their
primordial signiﬁcance through the way in which it receives them. It is
not a matter of reducing the signiﬁcance of the word ‘warm’ to sensations of warmth by empiricist standards. For the warmth which I feel
when I read the word ‘warm’ is not an actual warmth. It is simply my
body which prepares itself for heat and which, so to speak, roughs out
its outline. In the same way, when a part of my body is mentioned to
me, or when I represent it to myself, I experience in the corresponding
part a quasi-sensation of contact which is merely the emergence of that
part of my body into the total body image. We are not, then reducing
the signiﬁcance of the word, or even of the percept, to a collection of
‘bodily sensations’ but we are saying that the body, in so far as it has
‘behaviour patterns’, is that strange object which uses its own parts as a
general system of symbols for the world, and through which we
can consequently ‘be at home in’ that world, ‘understand’ it and ﬁnd
signiﬁcance in it.
All this, it will be said, has doubtless some value as description of
appearance. But how does that help if, in the end, these descriptions
mean nothing that can be conceived, and if on reﬂection they are
dismissed as nonsense? As popularly conceived one’s own body is both
a constituted and constituting object in relation to other objects. But if
we are to know what we are talking about, we must choose and, in the
last analysis, assign it to the sphere of the constituted object. I do, in
fact, one of two things. Either I consider myself as within the world,
inserted into it by my body which is beset by casual relations, in which
case ‘the senses’ and ‘the body’ are material instruments which have no
knowledge of anything; the object throws an image on to the retinas,
and the retinal image is duplicated in the optical centre by a second
image, but all this consists of nothing but things to see and nobody who sees,
so that we are thrown back indeﬁnitely from one bodily stage to
another, conjecturing within man a ‘little man’, and within him a

constituted, from what is in itself, and seize by reﬂection a being for
whom the object can exist. Now, for the object to exist in the eyes of
the subject, it is not enough for this ‘subject’ to ﬁx his eyes on it or
grasp it as my hand grasps this piece of wood, he must in addition
know that he is seizing or watching it, he must know himself seizing or
watching, his action must be entirely given to himself, and ﬁnally this
subject must be nothing other than what he is conscious of being,
otherwise we should have a seizure or a contemplation of the object for
some third party, while the alleged subject, being unaware of himself,
would be dispersed through his act and unconscious of anything. For
there to be any sight or tactile perception of the object, the senses will
always lack that dimension of absence, that unreality through which
the subject may be self-knowledge and the object may exist for him.
The consciousness of the uniﬁed presupposes consciousness of the
unifying agent and of his act of uniﬁcation; consciousness of the object
presupposes self-consciousness, or rather they are synonymous. In so
far, then, as there is consciousness of something, it is because the
subject is absolutely nothing and the ‘sensations’, the ‘material’ of
knowledge are not phases or inhabitants of consciousness, they are part
of the constituted world. Of what avail are our descriptions against
these self-evident truths and how could they escape from this
dilemma?
Let us return to the perceptual experience. I perceive this table on
which I am writing. This means, among other things, that my act of
perception occupies me, and occupies me suﬃciently for me to be
unable, while I am actually perceiving the table, to perceive myself
perceiving it. When I want to do this, I cease, so to speak, to use my
gaze in order to plunge into the table, I turn back to myself who am
perceiving, and then realize that my perception must have gone
through certain subjective appearances, and interpreted certain of my
own ‘sensations’; in short it takes its place in the perspective of
my individual history. I start from uniﬁed experience and from there
acquire, in a secondary way, consciousness of a unifying activity
when, taking up an analytical attitude, I break up perception into
qualities and sensations, and when, in order to recapture on the basis

sense experience

of these the object into which I was in the ﬁrst place blindly thrown, I
am obliged to suppose an act of synthesis which is merely the counterpart of my analysis. My act of perception, in its unsophisticated
form, does not itself bring about this synthesis; it takes advantage of
work already done, of a general synthesis constituted once and for all,
and this is what I mean when I say that I perceive with my body or my
senses, since my body and my senses are precisely that familiarity with
the world born of habit, that implicit or sedimentary body of knowledge. If my consciousness were at present constituting the world
which it perceives, no distance would separate them and there would
be no possible discrepancy between them; it would ﬁnd its way into
the world’s hidden concatenations, intentionality would carry us to
the heart of the object, and simultaneously the percept would lose the
thickness conferred by the present, and consciousness would not be
lost and become bogged down in it. But what we in fact have is
consciousness of an inexhaustible object, and we are sucked into it
because, between it and us, there is this latent knowledge which our
gaze uses—the possibility of its rational development being a mere
matter of presumption on our part—and which remains forever
anterior to our perception. If, as we have said, every perception has
something anonymous in it, this is because it makes use of something
which it takes for granted. The person who perceives is not spread out
before himself as a consciousness must be; he has historical density, he
takes up a perceptual tradition and is faced with a present. In perception we do not think the object and we do not think ourselves thinking
it, we are given over to the object and we merge into this body which
is better informed than we are about the world, and about the motives
we have and the means at our disposal for synthesizing it. That is why
we said with Herder that man is a sensorium commune. In this primary
layer of sense experience which is discovered only provided that we
really coincide with the act of perception and break with the critical
attitude, I have the living experience of the unity of the subject and the
intersensory unity of the thing, and do not conceive them after the
fashion of analytical reﬂection and science. But what is the uniﬁed
without uniﬁcation, what is this object which is not yet an object for
someone? Psychological reﬂection, which posits my act of perception
as an event in my personal history, may well be a second order thing.

277

278 phenomenology of perception
But transcendental reﬂection which reveals me as the non-temporal
thinker of the object, brings nothing to it which is not already there: it
restricts itself to the formulation of what gives signiﬁcance to ‘the
table’ and ‘the chair’, what underlies their stable structure and makes
my experience of objectivity possible. In short, what is living the unity
of the object or the subject, if it is not making it? Even if it be supposed that this unity makes its appearance with the phenomenon of
my body, must I not think of it in my body in order to ﬁnd it there,
and must I not eﬀect the synthesis of this phenomenon in order to
have the experience of it? We are not trying to derive the for itself from
the in itself, nor are we returning to some form of empiricism; the body
to which we are entrusting the synthesis of the perceived world is not
a pure datum, a thing passively received. For us the perceptual synthesis is a temporal synthesis, and subjectivity, at the level of perception, is nothing but temporality, and this is what enables us to leave to
the subject of perception his opacity and historicity. I open my eyes on
to my table; and my consciousness is ﬂooded with colours and confused reﬂections; it is hardly distinguishable from what is oﬀered to it;
it spreads out, through its accompanying body, into the spectacle
which so far is not a spectacle of anything. Suddenly, I start to focus
my eyes on the table which is not yet there, I begin to look into the
distance while there is as yet no depth, my body centres itself on an
object which is still only potential, and so disposes its sensitive surfaces as to make it a present reality. I can thus re-assign to its place in
the world the something which was impinging upon me, because I
can, by slipping into the future, throw into the immediate past the
world’s ﬁrst attack upon my senses, and direct myself towards the
determinate object as towards a near future. The act of looking is
indivisibly prospective, since the object is the ﬁnal stage of my process
of focusing, and retrospective, since it will present itself as preceding
its own appearance, as the ‘stimulus’, the motive or the prime mover
of every process since its beginning. The spatial synthesis and the
synthesis of the object are based on this unfolding of time. In every
focusing movement my body unites present, past and future, it secretes
time, or rather it becomes that location in nature where, for the ﬁrst
time, events, instead of pushing each other into the realm of being,
project round the present a double horizon of past and future and

sense experience

acquire a historical orientation. There is here indeed the summoning,
but not the experience, of an eternal natura naturans. My body takes
possession of time; it brings into existence a past and a future for a
present; it is not a thing, but creates time instead of submitting to it.
But every act of focusing must be renewed, otherwise it falls into
unconsciousness. The object remains clearly before me provided that I
run my eyes over it, free-ranging scope being an essential property of
the gaze. The hold which it gives us upon a segment of time, the
synthesis which it eﬀects are themselves temporal phenomena which
pass, and can be recaptured only in a fresh act which is itself temporal.
The claim to objectivity laid by each perceptual act is remade by its
successor, again disappointed and once more made. This everrecurrent failure of perceptual consciousness was foreseeable from the
start. If I cannot see the object except by distancing it in the past, this is
because, like the ﬁrst attack launched by the object upon my senses,
the succeeding perception equally occupies and expunges my consciousness; it is because this perception will in turn pass away, the
subject of perception never being an absolute subjectivity, but being
destined to become an object for an ulterior I. Perception is always in
the mode of the impersonal ‘One’. It is not a personal act enabling me
to give a fresh signiﬁcance to my life. The person who, in sensory
exploration, gives a past to the present and directs it towards a future,
is not myself as an autonomous subject, but myself in so far as I have a
body and am able to ‘look’. Rather than being a genuine history,
perception ratiﬁes and renews in us a ‘prehistory’. And that again is of
the essence of time: there would be no present, that is to say, no
sensible world with its thickness and inexhaustible richness, if perception, in Hegel’s words, did not retain a past in the depth of the present,
and did not contract that past into that depth. It fails at this moment to
realize the synthesis of its object, not because it is the passive recipient
of it, as empiricists would have it, but because the unity of the object
makes its appearance through the medium of time, and because time
slips away as fast as it catches up with itself. It is true that I ﬁnd,
through time, later experiences interlocking with earlier ones and
carrying them further, but nowhere do I enjoy absolute possession of
myself by myself, since the hollow void of the future is for ever being
reﬁlled with a fresh present. There is no related object without relation

279

280 phenomenology of perception
and without subject, no unity without uniﬁcation, but every synthesis
is both exploded and rebuilt by time which, with one and the same
process, calls it into question and conﬁrms it because it produces a
new present which retains the past. The duality of naturata and naturans is
therefore converted into a dialectic of constituted and constituting
time. If we are to solve the problem which we have set ourselves—that
of sensoriality, or ﬁnite subjectivity—it will be by thinking about time
and showing how it exists only for a subjectivity, since without the
latter, the past in itself being no longer and the future in itself being
not yet, there would be no time—and how nevertheless this subject is
time itself, and how we can say with Hegel that time is the existence of
mind, or refer with Husserl to a self-constitution of time.
For the moment, the preceding descriptions and those which are to
follow serve to make us familiar with a new type of reﬂection from
which we await the solution of our problems. For intellectualism,
reﬂecting is distancing or objectifying sensation and confronting it
with a subject without content capable of ranging over this diversity
and for whom the latter can exist. In so far as intellectualism puriﬁes
consciousness by delivering it of all opacity, it makes a genuine thing
out of the hylé, and the apprehension of any concrete contents, the
coming together of this thing and the mind, becomes inconceivable. If
it be objected that the material of knowledge is a result of analysis and
should not be treated as a real element, it has to be recognized that in a
corresponding way the synthetic unity of apperception is also a theoretical version of experience, that it should not be given any ﬁrst-hand
value and, in short, that the theory of knowledge has to be begun all
over again. We agree that the matter and form of knowledge are results
of analysis. I posit the stuﬀ of knowledge when, breaking away from
the primary faith inspired by perception, I adopt a critical attitude
towards it and ask ‘what I am really seeing’. The task of a radical
reﬂection, the kind that aims at self-comprehension, consists, paradoxically enough, in recovering the unreﬂective experience of the
world, and subsequently reassigning to it the veriﬁcatory attitude and
reﬂective operations, and displaying reﬂection as one possibility of my
being. What have we then at the outset? Not a given manifold with a
synthetic apperception which ranges over it and completely penetrates
it, but a certain perceptual ﬁeld against the background of a world.

sense experience

Nothing here is thematized. Neither object nor subject is posited. In the
primary ﬁeld we have not a mosaic of qualities, but a total conﬁguration which distributes functional values according to the demands of
the whole; for example, as we have seen, a ‘white’ paper in the shade is
not white in the sense of possessing an objective quality, but it counts
as white. What is called sensation is only the most rudimentary of
perceptions, and, as a modality of existence, it is no more separable
than any other perception from a background which is in fact the
world. Correspondingly each act of perception appears to itself to be
picked out from some all-embracing adherence to the world. At the
centre of this system lies the ability to suspend vital communication, or
at least to limit it, by concentrating our gaze on a part of the spectacle
and devoting the whole of the perceptual ﬁeld to it. We must not, as we
have seen, suppose that the determinate forms reached through the
critical attitude are actually in the primordial experience, or, in consequence, talk about a synthesis which is present, so long as the manifold is as yet undissociated. Must we then reject the idea of synthesis
and of a stuﬀ of knowledge? Are we to say that perception reveals
objects as a light illuminates them in the night, are we to adopt for our
own purposes that realism which, according to Malebranche, leads us
to imagine the soul issuing through the eyes and exploring objects in
the world? That would not rid us of even the idea of synthesis since, in
order to perceive a surface, for example, it is not enough to explore it,
we must keep in mind the moments of our exploratory journey and
relate the points on the surface to each other. But we have seen that
primary perception is a non-thetic,* pre-objective and pre-conscious
experience. Let us therefore say provisionally that there is a merely possible stuﬀ of knowledge. From every point of the primordial ﬁeld
intentions move outwards, vacant and yet determinate; in realizing
these intentions, analysis will arrive at the object of science, at sensation as a private phenomenon, and at the pure subject which posits
both. These three terminal concepts are no nearer than on the horizon
of primordial experience. It is in the experience of the thing that the
reﬂective ideal of positing thought shall have its basis. Hence reﬂection

* I.e. non-positing (Translator’s note).

281

282 phenomenology of perception
does not itself grasp its full signiﬁcance unless it refers to the
unreﬂective fund of experience which it presupposes, upon which it
draws, and which constitutes for it a kind of original past, a past which
has never been a present.

2
SPACE
We have just recognized that analysis has no justiﬁcation for positing any
stuﬀ of knowledge as an ideally separable ‘moment’ and that this stuﬀ,
when brought into being by an act of reﬂection, already relates to the
world. Reﬂection does not follow in the reverse direction a path already
traced by the constitute act, and the natural reference of the stuﬀ to the
world leads us to a new conception of intentionality, since the classical
conception,1 which treats the experience of the world as a pure act of
constituting consciousness, manages to do so only in so far as it deﬁnes
consciousness as absolute non-being, and correspondingly consigns its
contents to a ‘hyletic layer’ which belongs to opaque being. We must
now approach this new intentionality in a more direct way by examining the symmetrical notion of a form of perception, and in particular
the notion of space. Kant tried to draw a strict demarcation line
between space as the form of external experience and the things given
within that experience. There is naturally no question of a relationship
of container to content, since this relationship exists only between
objects, nor even a relationship of logical inclusion, like the one existing between the individual and the class, since space is anterior to its

that of Husserl in the second period of his philosophy (the period of the Ideen).

284 phenomenology of perception
alleged parts, which are always carved out of it. Space is not the setting
(real or logical) in which things are arranged, but the means whereby
the position of things becomes possible. This means that instead of
imagining it as a sort of ether in which all things ﬂoat, or conceiving it
abstractly as a characteristic that they have in common, we must think
of it as the universal power enabling them to be connected. Therefore,
either I do not reﬂect, but live among things and vaguely regard space
at one moment as the setting for things, at another as their common
attribute—or else I do reﬂect: I catch space at its source, and now think
the relationships which underlie this word, realizing then that they live
only through the medium of a subject who traces out and sustains
them; and pass from spatialized to spatializing space. In the ﬁrst case,
my body and things, their concrete relationships expressed in such
terms as top and bottom, right and left, near and far, may appear to me
as an irreducibly manifold variety, whereas in the second case I discover a single and indivisible ability to trace out space. In the ﬁrst case, I
am concerned with physical space, with its variously qualiﬁed regions:
in the second with geometrical space having interchangeable dimensions, homogeneous and isotropic, and here I can at least think of a
pure change of place which would leave the moving body unchanged,
and consequently a pure position distinct from the situation of the object
in its concrete context. We know how this distinction is blurred in
modern conceptions of space, even at the level of scientiﬁc knowledge.
Here we want to confront it, not with the technical instruments which
modern physics has acquired, but with our experience of space, the
ultimate court of appeal, according to Kant himself, of all knowledge
connected with space. Is it true that we are faced with the alternative
either of perceiving things in space, or (if we reﬂect and try to discover
the signiﬁcance of our own experiences) of conceiving space as the
indivisible system governing the acts of uniﬁcation performed by a
constituting mind? Does not the experience of space provide a basis for
its unity by means of an entirely diﬀerent kind of synthesis?
Let us consider it before any theoretical elaboration has taken place.
Take, for instance, our experience of ‘top’ and ‘bottom’. We cannot
catch it in the ordinary run of living, because it is then hidden under its
own acquisitions. We must examine some exceptional case in which it
disintegrates and re-forms before our eyes, for example, in cases of

space

vision without retinal inversion. If a subject is made to wear glasses
which correct the retinal images, the whole landscape at ﬁrst appears
unreal and upside down; on the second day of the experiment normal
perception begins to reassert itself, except that the subject has the
feeling that his own body is upside down.2 In the course of a second set
of experiments3 lasting a week, objects at ﬁrst appear inverted, but less
unreal than the ﬁrst time. On the second day the landscape is no longer
inverted, but the body is felt to be in an abnormal position. From the
third to the seventh day, the body progressively rights itself, and ﬁnally
seems to occupy a normal position, particularly when the subject is
active. When he is lying motionless on a couch, the body still presents
itself against the background of the former space, and, as far as the
unseen parts of the body are concerned, right and left preserve their
former localization to the end of the experiment. External objects
increasingly have a look of ‘reality’ From the ﬁfth day, actions which
were at ﬁrst liable to be misled by the new mode of vision and had to
be corrected in the light of the general visual upheaval, now go infallibly to their objective. The new visual appearances which, at the
beginning, stood out against a background of previous space, develop
round themselves, at ﬁrst (third day) only through a great eﬀort of will,
later (seventh day) with no eﬀort at all, a horizon with a general
orientation corresponding to their own. On the seventh day, the placing of sounds is correct so long as the sounding object is seen as well
as heard. It remains unreliable, and with a double, or even inaccurate,
representation, if the source of the sound does not appear in the visual
ﬁeld. At the end of the experiment, when the glasses are removed,
objects appear not inverted, it is true, but ‘queer’, and motor reactions
are reversed: the subject reaches out his right hand when it should be
his left. The psychologist is at ﬁrst tempted to say4 that after the glasses
have been put on, the visual world is given to the subject exactly as if it
had been turned through 180°, and consequently is upside down for him.
As the illustrations in a book appear upside down to us if someone has
played the trick of placing it ‘top to bottom’ while we were looking

away, the mass of sensations which make up the panorama has been
turned round, and similarly placed ‘top to bottom’. That other mass of
sensations which is the world of touch has meanwhile stayed ‘the right
way’; it can no longer coincide with the visual world so that the subject
has two irreconcilable representations of his body, one given to him by
his tactile sensations and by those ‘visual images’ which he has managed to retain from the period preceding the experiment; the other,
that of his present vision which shows him his body ‘head downwards’. This conﬂict of images can end only if one of the two contestants withdraws. Finding out how a normal situation is restored
amounts then to ﬁnding out how the new image of the world and
one’s own body can cause the other to ‘pale’,5 or ‘displace’ it.6 It is
noticeable that the normal situation is the more successfully achieved
in proportion as the subject is more active; for example, as early as the
second day when he washes his hands.7 It would appear then that it is
the experience of movement guided by sight which teaches the subject
to harmonize the visual and tactile data: he becomes aware, for
instance, that the movement needed to reach his legs, hitherto a
movement ‘downwards’, makes its appearance in the new visual spectacle as one which was previously ‘upwards’. Observations of this kind
enable inappropriate gestures to be corrected in the early stages by
taking visual data as simply signs to be decoded and by translating
them into the language of the former space. Once they have become
‘habitual’,8 they set up between the old and the new directions, stable
‘associations’9 which do away with the former in favour of the latter,
these being dominant by reason of their visual origin. The ‘top’ of the
visual ﬁeld, where the legs at ﬁrst appear, having been frequently identiﬁed with what is ‘down’ for the touch, soon the subject has no
further need of the mediation of calculated movements to pass from
one system to the other; his legs settle down at what he used to call the
‘top’ of the visual ﬁeld; not only does he ‘see’ them there, he also ‘feels’

them there10 and eventually ‘what had previously been ‘the top’ of the
visual ﬁeld begins to give an impression similar to that which belonged
to the “bottom”, and vice versa’.11 As soon as the tactile body links up
with the visual one, that region of the visual ﬁeld in which the subject’s
feet appeared stops being described as ‘the top’. This designation
is transferred to the region in which the head appears, and that
containing the feet once more becomes the bottom.
But this interpretation is unintelligible. The inversion of the landscape, followed by the return to normal vision, are explained by supposing that the top and bottom are turned topsyturvy and vary with
the apparent direction of head and feet as the latter are given in the image that
they are, so to speak, marked out in the sensory ﬁeld by the actual
distribution of sensations. But in no case—either at the beginning of
the experiment, when the world is ‘turned upside down’, or at the end
when it ‘rights itself’—can the orientation of the ﬁeld be given by
these contents of head and feet which appear in it. For these contents
would themselves have to have a direction, in order to pass it on to the
ﬁeld. ‘Inverted’ or ‘upright’, in themselves, obviously have no meaning.
The reply will run: after putting on the glasses the visual ﬁeld appears
inverted in relation to the tactile and bodily ﬁeld, or the ordinary visual
ﬁeld, which, by nominal deﬁnition, we say are ‘upright’. But the same
question arises concerning these ﬁelds which we take as standard: their
mere presence is not enough to provide any direction whatsoever.
Among things, two points are enough to establish a direction. But we
are not among things, we have as yet only sensory ﬁelds which are not
collections of sensations placed before us, sometimes ‘head to the top’,
sometimes ‘head downwards’, but systems of appearances varyingly
orientated during the course of the experiment, even where no change
occurs in the grouping of stimuli. So it is precisely a matter of ﬁnding
out what happens when these ﬂoating appearances are suddenly
anchored and take up a position in relation to ‘up’ and ‘down’,
whether at the beginning of the experiment, when the tactile and
bodily ﬁeld seems ‘upright’ and the visual ﬁeld ‘inverted’, or subsequently when the ﬁrst turns upside down while the second rights

itself, or ﬁnally at the conclusion of the experiment when both are
more or less ‘straight’. One cannot take the world and orientated space
as given along with the contents of sense experience or with the body
in itself, since experience in fact shows that the same contents can be
successively orientated in one direction or another, and that objective
relationships as registered on the retina through the position of the
physical image do not govern our experience of ‘up’ and ‘down’. What
we want to know is how an object can appear to us as ‘the right way
up’ or ‘inverted’, and what these words mean.
The question is applicable not only to an empiricist psychology
which treats the perception of space as the reception, within ourselves,
of a real space, and the phenomenal orientation of objects as reﬂecting
their orientation in the world. It is equally relevant to intellectualist
psychology in which the ‘upright’ and the ‘inverted’ are relationships
dependent upon the ﬁxed points chosen. As the axis of co-ordinates
selected, whatever it may be, is as yet situated in space only in relation
to another guide-post, and so on, so the task of taking the world’s
bearings is indeﬁnitely postponed. ‘Up’ and ‘down’ lose any speciﬁc
meaning they might have, unless, by an impossible contradiction, we
recognize certain contents as having the power to take up a position in
space, which brings back empiricism and its diﬃculties. It is easy to
show that there can be a direction only for a subject who takes it, and a
constituting mind is eminently able to trace out all directions in space,
but has at any moment no direction, and consequently no space, without an actual starting-point, an absolute ‘here’ which can gradually
confer a signiﬁcance on all spatial determinations. Intellectualism as
well as empiricism remains anterior to the problem of orientated
space, because it cannot even begin to ask the question. In the case of
empiricism, the question was how the image of the world which, in
itself, is inverted, can right itself for me. Intellectualism cannot even
concede that the image of the world, after the glasses are put on, is
inverted. For there is nothing, for a constituting mind, to distinguish
the experience before from the experience after putting on the glasses,
or even anything to make the visual experience of the ‘inverted’ body
incompatible with the tactile experience of the ‘upright’ body, since it
does not view the spectacle from anywhere, and since all the objective
relations between the body and its environment are preserved in the

space

new spectacle. We can therefore see what the question involves;
empiricism would willingly take the actual orientation of my bodily
experience as the ﬁxed point we need if we are to understand that there
are directions for us,—but both experience and reﬂection demonstrate
that no content is in itself orientated. Intellectualism starts from this
relativity of up and down, but cannot stand outside it in order to
account for an actual perception of space. We cannot understand, therefore, the experience of space either in terms of the consideration of
contents or of that of some pure unifying activity; we are confronted
with that third spatiality towards which we pointed a little while ago,
which is neither that of things in space, nor that of spatializing space,
and which, on this account, evades the Kantian analysis and is presupposed by it. We need an absolute within the sphere of the relative, a
space which does not skate over appearances, which indeed takes root
in them and is dependent upon them, yet which is nevertheless
not given along with them in any realist way, and can, as Stratton’s
experiment shows, survive their complete disorganization. We have
to look for the ﬁrst-hand experience of space on the hither side of the
distinction between form and content.
If we so contrive it that a subject sees the room in which he is, only
through a mirror which reﬂects it at an angle at 45° to the vertical, the
subject at ﬁrst sees the room ‘slantwise’. A man walking about in it
seems to lean to one side as he goes. A piece of cardboard falling down
the door-frame looks to be falling obliquely. The general eﬀect is
‘queer’. After a few minutes a sudden change occurs: the walls, the
man walking about the room, and the line in which the cardboard falls
become vertical.12 This experiment, analogous to Stratton’s, has the
advantage of throwing into relief an instantaneous redistribution of
high and low, without any motor exploration. We were already aware
that it is meaningless to say that the oblique (or inverted) image brings
with it a repositioning of high and low which we come to identify by a
motor exploration of the new spectacle. But now we see that this
exploration is not even necessary, and that consequently bearings are
taken by a global act on the part of the perceiving subject. Let us say
that perception before the experiment recognizes a certain spatial level, in
12

290 phenomenology of perception
relation to which the spectacle provided in the experiment ﬁrst of all
appears oblique, and that during the experiment this spectacle induces
another level in relation to which the whole of the visual ﬁeld can once
more seem straight. It is as if certain objects (walls, doors and the body
of the man in the room), having been seen aslant in relation to a given
level, then take it upon themselves to provide the cardinal directions,
attracting to themselves the vertical, acting as ‘anchoring points’,13 and
causing the previously established horizontal to tilt sideways. We are
not falling here into the realistic mistake of using the visual spectacle as
a source of directions in space, since the spectacle experimentally provided is turned (obliquely) for us only in relation to a certain level, and
since, therefore, it does not give us by itself the new up-and-down axis.
It remains to be seen what precisely is this level which is always ahead
of itself, since every constitution of a level presupposes a diﬀerent, preestablished level—how the ‘anchoring points’, working from within a
certain space from which they derive their stability, suggest to us the
constitution of a fresh one, what ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ really are, unless
they are merely names applicable to an orientation in itself of the
contents of sense experience. We hold that the ‘spatial level’ is not
confused with the orientation of one’s own body. In so far as consciousness of one’s own body indubitably contributes to the constitution of level (a subject tilting his head on one side holds a stick
obliquely, when he is asked to hold it vertically)14 it is, in this function,
in competition with the other sectors of experience, and the vertical
tends to follow the direction of the head only if the visual ﬁeld is
empty, and if the ‘anchoring points’ are lacking, for example when
one is working in the dark. As a mass of tactile, labyrinthine and
kinaesthetic data, the body has no more deﬁnite orientation than the
other contents of experience, and it too receives this orientation from
the general level of experience. Wertheimer’s observation serves to
show how the visual ﬁeld can impose an orientation which is not that
of the body. But although the body, as a mosaic of given sensations, has
no speciﬁc direction, nevertheless, as an agent, it plays an essential part
in the establishment of a level. Variations in muscular tonicity, even

with a full visual ﬁeld, so modify the apparent vertical that the subject
leans his head on one side in order to place it parallel to this deﬂected
vertical.15 One might be tempted to say that the vertical is the direction
represented by the symmetry axis of our body as a synergic system. My
body can, however, more without drawing along with it the directions
of upward and downward, as when I lie down on the ground, and
Wertheimer’s experiment shows that the objective direction of my
body can form an appreciable angle with the apparent vertical of the
spectacle. What counts for the orientation of the spectacle is not my
body as it in fact is, as a thing in objective space, but as a system of possible actions, a virtual body with its phenomenal ‘place’ deﬁned by its
task and situation. My body is wherever there is something to be done.
As soon as Wertheimer’s subject takes his place in the experimental
situation prepared for him, the area of his possible actions—such
as walking, opening a cupboard, using a table, sitting down—outlines in front of him, even if he has his eyes shut, a possible habitat. At
ﬁrst the mirror image presents him with a room diﬀerently canted,
which means that the subject is not at home with the utensils it contains, he does not inhabit it, and does not share it with the man he sees
walking to and for. After a few minutes, provided that he does not
strengthen his initial anchorage by glancing away from the mirror, the
reﬂected room miraculously calls up a subject capable of living in it.
This virtual body ousts the real one to such an extent that the subject
no longer has the feeling of being in the world where he actually is,
and that instead of his real legs and arms, he feels that he has the legs
and arms he would need to walk and act in the reﬂected room: he
inhabits the spectacle. The spatial level tilts and takes up its new position. It is, then, a certain possession of the world by my body, a certain
gearing of my body to the world. Being projected, in the absence of
anchoring points, by the attitude of my body alone, as in Nagel’s
experiments—speciﬁed, when the body is inert, through the demands
of the spectacle alone, as in Wertheimer’s experiment—it normally
makes its appearance where my motor intentions and my perceptual
ﬁeld join forces, when my actual body is at one with the virtual body
required by the spectacle, and the actual spectacle with the setting
15

292 phenomenology of perception
which my body throws round it. It comes to rest when, between my
body as the potentiality for certain movements, as the demand for
certain preferential planes, and the spectacle perceived as an invitation
to the same movements and the scene of the same actions, a pact is
concluded which gives me the enjoyment of space and gives to things
their direct power over my body. The constitution of a spatial level is
simply one means of constituting an integrated world: my body is
geared onto the world when my perception presents me with a spectacle as varied and as clearly articulated as possible, and when my
motor intentions, as they unfold, receive the responses they expect
from the world. This maximum sharpness of perception and action
points clearly to a perceptual ground, a basis of my life, a general setting
in which my body can co-exist with the world. With the notion of a
spatial level, and of the body as the subject of space, we begin to
understand the phenomena described by Stratton but left unexplained
by him. If the ‘correction’ of the ﬁeld were the outcome of a set of
associations between the new positions and the old, how could the
operation convey the general eﬀect of being systematic, and how could
whole sections of the perceptual horizon suddenly fall into line with
already ‘corrected’ objects? If, on the other hand, the new orientation
sprang from a process of thought, and consisted of a change of coordinates, how could the auditory or tactile ﬁeld resist transposition?
The constituting subject would, per impossibile, have to be cut oﬀ from
himself and able to overlook in one place what he was doing in
another.16 In so far as the transposition is systematic, and yet piecemeal and progressive, it is because I go from one system of positions to
the other without having the key to each, and in the way that a man
sings, in another key, a tune he has heard, though he has no knowledge
of music. The possession of a body implies the ability to change levels
16

Change of direction in acoustic phenomena is extremely diﬃcult to bring about. If we
arrange, with the aid of a pseudophone, for sounds coming from the left to reach the
right ear before they strike the left, we get an inversion of the auditory ﬁeld comparable
to the inversion of the visual ﬁeld in Stratton’s experiment. Now even with long practice
people do not manage to ‘correct’ the auditory ﬁeld. The placing of sounds by hearing
alone remains incorrect to the end. It is correct, and the sound seems to come from the
object on the left only if the object is seen at the same time as it is heard. P. T. Young,
Auditory localization with acoustical transposition of the ears.

and to ‘understand’ space, just as the possession of a voice implies the
ability to change key. The perceptual ﬁeld corrects itself and at the
conclusion of the experiment I identify it without any concept because
I live in it, because I am borne wholly into the new spectacle and, so to
speak, transfer my centre of gravity into it.17 At the beginning of the
experiment, the visual ﬁeld appears both inverted and unreal because
the subject does not live in it and is not geared to it. In the course of the
experiment, we notice an intermediate phase in which the tactile body
seems to be inverted and the landscape upright because, since I already
live in the landscape, I see it accordingly as upright, the disturbance
brought about by the experiment being concentrated in my own body,
which thus becomes, not a mass of aﬀective sensations, but the body
which is needed to perceive a given spectacle. Everything throws us
back on to the organic relations between subject and space, to that
gearing of the subject onto his world which is the origin of space.
But one may wish to go further into the analysis. Why, it may be
asked, are clear perception and assured action possible only in a phenomenal space which is orientated? This is obvious only if we suppose
the subject of perception and action faced with a world where there are
already absolute directions, so that he has to adjust the dimensions of
his behaviour to those of the world. But we are now placing ourselves
inside perception, and we are puzzled to know precisely how it can
come by absolute directions, and so we cannot suppose them to be
given at the source of our spatial experience. The objection amounts to
saying what we have been saying from the start: that the constitution of
a level always presupposes another given level, that space always precedes itself. But this remark is not a mere admission of defeat. It
enlightens us concerning the essence of space and the only method
which enables us to understand it. It is of the essence of space to be
always ‘already constituted’, and we shall never come to understand it
by withdrawing into a worldless perception. We must not wonder why
being is orientated, why existence is spatial, why, using the expression
we used a little while ago, our body is not geared to the world in all its
positions, and why its co-existence with the world magnetizes
17

The subject can, in experiments on auditory inversion, produce the illusion of
correct localization when he sees the source of sound, because he inhibits his auditory
phenomena and ‘lives’ in the visual. P. T. Young, ibid.

experience and induces a direction in it. The question could be asked
only if the facts were fortuitous happenings to a subject and an object
indiﬀerent to space, whereas perceptual experience shows that they are
presupposed in our primordial encounter with being, and that being is
synonymous with being situated. For the thinking subject a face seen
‘the right way up’ and the same face seen ‘upside down’ are indistinguishable. For the subject of perception the face seen ‘upside down’
is unrecognizable. If someone is lying on a bed, and I look at him from
the head of the bed, the face is for a moment normal. It is true that the
features are in a way disarranged, and I have some diﬃculty in realizing
that the smile is a smile, but I feel that I could, if I wanted, walk round
the bed, and I seem to see through the eyes of a spectator standing at
the foot of the bed. If the spectacle is protracted, it suddenly changes its
appearance: the face takes on an utterly unnatural aspect, its expressions become terrifying, and the eyelashes and eyebrows assume an air
of materiality such as I have never seen in them. For the ﬁrst time I
really see the inverted face as if this were its ‘natural’ position: in front
of me I have a pointed, hairless head with a red, teeth-ﬁlled oriﬁce in
the forehead and, where the mouth ought to be, two moving orbs
edged with glistening hairs and underlined with stiﬀ brushes. It will
probably be said that the face seen the ‘right way up’ is, among all the
possible aspects of a face, the one which is most frequently given to
me, and that the inverted face startles me because I see it only rarely.
But faces are not often presented in a strictly vertical position, the
‘upright’ face enjoys no statistical preponderance, and the question is
why, this being the case, it is given to me more often than any other. If
it be conceded that my perception makes it a standard and refers to it as
to a norm for reasons of symmetry, the question arises why, beyond a
certain angle, the ‘correction’ does not operate. We must conclude that
my gaze which moves over the face, and in doing so favours certain
directions, does not recognize the face unless it comes up against its
details in a certain irreversible order, and that the very signiﬁcance of
the object—here the face and its expressions—must be linked to its
orientation, as indeed is indicated by the double usage of the French
word sens.* To invert an object is to deprive it of its signiﬁcance. Its
* ‘sense, signiﬁcance, direction’ (Translator’s note).

space

being as an object is, therefore, not a being-for-the-thinking subject,
but a being-for-the-gaze which meets it at a certain angle, and otherwise fails to recognize it. This is why each object has its ‘top’ and its
‘bottom’ which indicate, for a given level, its ‘natural’ position, the one
which it ‘should’ occupy. To see a face is not to conceive the idea of a
certain law of constitution to which the object invariably conforms
throughout all its possible orientations, it is to take a certain hold upon
it, to be able to follow on its surface a certain perceptual route with its
ups and downs, and one just as unrecognizable taken in reverse as the
mountain up which I was so recently toiling, and down which I am
now striding my way. Generally speaking, our perception would not
comprise either outlines, ﬁgures, backgrounds or objects, and would
consequently not be perception of anything, or indeed exist at all, if the
subject of perception were not this gaze which takes a grip upon things
only in so far as they have a general direction; and this general direction
in space is not a contingent characteristic of the object, it is the means
whereby I recognize it and am conscious of it as of an object. It is true
that I can be conscious of the same object variously orientated, and, as
we have said, I can even recognize an inverted face. But it is always
provided that mentally we take up position in front of it, and sometimes we even do so physically, as when we tilt our head to look at a
photograph held in front of him by a person at our side. Thus, since
every conceivable being is related either directly or indirectly to the
perceived world, and since the perceived world is grasped only in
terms of direction, we cannot dissociate being from orientated being,
and there is no occasion to ‘ﬁnd a basis for space or to ask what is the
level of all levels. The primordial level is on the horizon of all our
perceptions, but it is a horizon which cannot in principle ever be
reached and thematized in our express perception. Each of the levels in
which we successively live makes its appearance when we cast anchor
in some ‘setting’ which is oﬀered to us. This setting itself is spatially
particularized only for a previously given level. Thus each of the whole
succession of our experiences, including the ﬁrst, passes on an already
acquired spatiality. The condition of our ﬁrst perception’s being spatial
is that it should have referred to some orientation which preceded it. It
must, then, have found us already at work in a world. Yet this cannot be
a certain world, a certain spectacle, since we have put ourselves at the

295

296 phenomenology of perception
origin of all of them. The ﬁrst spatial level cannot ﬁnd its anchorage
anywhere, since this anchorage would need a level anterior to the ﬁrst
level in order to be particularized in space. And since it cannot be
orientated ‘in itself’, my ﬁrst perception and my ﬁrst hold upon the
world must appear to me as action in accordance with an earlier
agreement reached between x and the world in general, my history
must be the continuation of a prehistory and must utilize the latter’s
acquired results. My personal existence must be the resumption of a
prepersonal tradition. There is, therefore, another subject beneath me,
for whom a world exists before I am here, and who marks out my place
in it. This captive or natural spirit is my body, not that momentary
body which is the instrument of my personal choices and which fastens upon this or that world, but the system of anonymous ‘functions’
which draw every particular focus into a general project. Nor does this
blind adherence to the world, this prejudice in favour of being, occur
only at the beginning of my life. It endows every subsequent perception, of space with its meaning, and it is resumed at every instant. Space
and perception generally represent, at the core of the subject, the fact of
his birth, the perpetual contribution of his bodily being, a communication with the world more ancient than thought. That is why they
saturate consciousness and are impenetrable to reﬂection. The instability of levels produces not only the intellectual experience of disorder,
but the vital experience of giddiness and nausea,18 which is the awareness of our contingency, and the horror with which it ﬁlls us. The
positing of a level means losing sight of this contingency; space has its
basis in our facticity. It is neither an object, nor an act of uniﬁcation on
the subject’s part; it can neither be observed, since it is presupposed in
every observation, nor seen to emerge from a constituting operation,
since it is of its essence that it be already constituted, for thus it can, by
its magic, confer its own spatial particularizations upon the landscape
without ever appearing itself.

through the mechanism of the skeleton or even through the nervous regulation of

weakened, the body collapses and becomes once more an object.

Traditional ideas of perception are at one in denying that depth is
visible. Berkeley shows that it could not be given to sight in the absence
of any means of recording it, since our retinas receive only a manifestly
ﬂat projection of the spectacle. If one retorted that after the criticism of
the ‘constancy hypothesis’ we cannot judge what we see by what is
pictured on our retinas, Berkeley would probably reply that, whatever
may be true of the retinal image, depth cannot be seen because it is not
spread out before our eyes, but appears to them only in foreshortened
form. In analytical reﬂection, it is for theoretical reasons that depth is to
be judged invisible: even if it could be registered by our eyes, the
sensory impression would present only a multiplicity in itself, which
would have to be ranged over, so that distance, like all other spatial
relations, exists only for a subject who synthesizes it and embraces it in
thought. Though diametrically opposed to each other, the two doctrines presuppose the same pushing aside of our actual experience. In
both cases depth is tacitly equated with breadth seen from the side, and this is
what makes it invisible. Berkeley’s argument, made quite explicit, runs
roughly like this. What I call depth is in reality a juxtaposition of
points, making it comparable to breadth. I am simply badly placed to
see it. I should see it if I were in the position of a spectator looking on
from the side, who can take in at a glance the series of objects spread
out in front of me, whereas for me they conceal each other—or see the
distance from my body to the ﬁrst object, whereas for me this distance
is compressed into a point. What makes depth invisible for me is
precisely what makes it visible for the spectator as breadth: the juxtaposition of simultaneous points in one direction which is that of my
gaze. The depth which is declared invisible is, therefore, a depth
already identiﬁed with breadth and, this being the case, the argument
would lack even a semblance of consistency. In the same way, intellectualism can bring to light, in the experience of depth, a thinking
subject who synthesizes that experience, only because it reﬂects on the
basis of a depth already in existence, on a juxtaposition of simultaneous
points which is not depth as it is presented to me, but as it is presented
to a spectator standing at the side, in short as breadth.19 By assimilating

between two objects, is made by Paliard, L’Illusion de Sinnsteden et le problème de l’implication

297

298 phenomenology of perception
one to the other from the very outset, the two philosophies take for
granted the result of a constitutive process the stages of which we must,
in fact, trace back. In order to treat depth as breadth viewed in proﬁle,
in order to arrive at a uniform space, the subject must leave his place,
abandon his point of view on the world, and think himself into a sort
of ubiquity. For God, who is everywhere, breadth is immediately
equivalent to depth. Intellectualism and empiricism do not give us any
account of the human experience of the world; they tell us what God
might think about it. And indeed it is the world itself which suggests to
us that we substitute one dimension for another and conceive it from
no point of view. All men accept without any speculation the equivalence of depth and breadth; this equivalence is part and parcel of the
self-evidence of an intersubjective world, which is what makes philosophers as forgetful as anyone else of the originality of depth. But prior
to this we know nothing of the world and of space as objective, we are
trying to describe the phenomenon of the world, that is, its birth for us in
that ﬁeld into which each perception sets us back, where we are as yet
still alone, where other people will appear only at a later stage, in
which knowledge and particularly science have not so far ironed out
and levelled down the individual perspective. It is through this birth
that we are destined to graduate to a world, and we must therefore
describe it. More directly than the other dimensions of space, depth
forces us to reject the preconceived notion of the world and rediscover
the primordial experience from which it springs: it is, so to speak, the
most ‘existential’ of all dimensions, because (and here Berkeley’s
argument is right) it is not impressed upon the object itself, it quite
clearly belongs to the perspective and not to things. Therefore it cannot
either be extracted from, or even put into that perspective by consciousness. It announces a certain indissoluble link between things and
myself by which I am placed in front of them, whereas breadth can, at
ﬁrst sight, pass for a relationship between things themselves, in which
the perceiving subject is not implied. By rediscovering the vision of
depth, that is to say, of a depth which is not yet objectiﬁed and made
up of mutually external points, we shall once more outrun the traditional alternatives and elucidate the relation between subject and
object.
Here is my table, farther away is the piano or the wall, or again a car

space

which is standing in front of me is started and drives away. What do these
words mean? In order to resuscitate the perceptual experience, let us
take as our starting point the superﬁcial account given by a thought
obsessed by the world and the object. These words, it is maintained,
mean that between the table and myself there is an interval, between
the car and myself an increasing interval that I cannot see from where I
am, but which reveals itself to me by the apparent size of the object. It
is the apparent size of the table, the piano and the wall which, relative
to their real size, assigns to them their place in space. When the car
slowly climbs up towards the horizon, all the while decreasing in size, I
account for this appearance by constructing a displacement in terms of
breadth such as I should perceive if I were observing the scene from an
aeroplane, and which, in the last analysis, is the whole meaning of
depth. But I have also other signs of distance to go on. As an object
approaches me, my eyes, as long as they are focused on it, converge.
The distance is the height of a triangle with its base and base angles
given to me20 and, when I say that I am seeing something at a distance,
I mean that the height of the triangle is determined by its relations to
these given sizes. The experience of depth, according to traditional
views, consists in interpreting certain given facts—the convergence of
the eyes, the apparent size of the image, for example—by placing them
in the context of objective relations which explain them. But my ability
to go back from the apparent size to its signiﬁcance is conditioned by
my knowledge that there is a world of undistortable objects, that my
body is standing in front of this world like a mirror and that, like the
image in the mirror, the one which is formed on the body screen is
exactly proportionate to the interval which separates it from the object.
My ability to understand convergence as a sign of distance is conditioned by my visualizing my gaze as the blind man’s two sticks,
which run more sharply together in proportion as the object is
brought nearer;21 in other words, by my inclusion of my eyes, body
and the external world into one and the same objective space. The
‘signs’ which, ex hypothesi, ought to acquaint us with the experience of
space can, therefore, convey the idea of space only if they are already

involved in it, and if it is already known. Since perception is initiation
into the world, and since, as has been said with insight, ‘there is nothing anterior to it which is mind’,22 we cannot put into it objective
relationships which are not yet constituted at its level. That is why the
Cartesians spoke of a ‘natural geometry’. The signiﬁcance of apparent
size and convergence, that is distance, cannot yet be set forth and
thematized. Apparent size and convergence themselves cannot be given
as elements in a system of objective relationships. ‘Natural geometry’
or ‘natural judgement’ are myths in the Platonic sense, intended to
represent the envelopment or ‘implication’ of a signiﬁcance in signs,
neither signs nor signiﬁcance being yet posited and explicitly contained in thought, and this is what we must elucidate by returning to
perceptual experience. We must describe apparent size and convergence, not as scientiﬁc knowledge sees them, but as we grasp them
from within. Gestalt psychologists23 have observed that they are not
explicitly known in perception itself—I am not expressly aware of the
convergence of my eyes or of apparent size when I perceive at a distance, they do not confront me as perceived facts do—and that they
nevertheless enter into the perception of distance, as the stereoscope
and illusions of perspective amply prove. Psychologists conclude from
this that they are not signs, but conditions or causes of depth. We
observe that organization in depth appears when a certain size of
retinal image or a certain degree of convergence is objectively produced in the body; this is a law comparable to the laws of physics, and
it has only to be recorded without more ado. But here the psychologist
is evading his task: when he recognizes that apparent size and convergence are not present in perception itself as objective facts, he is
requiring us to return to the pure description of phenomena prior to
the objective world, and giving us a glimpse of ‘lived’ depth,
independently of any kind of geometry. And then he interrupts the
description in order to put himself back in the world and derive organization in depth from a chain of observed facts. Can one thus limit
description and, once having recognized the phenomenal order as an
original order, re-assign the production of phenomenal depth to some

cerebral alchemy only the result of which is recorded by experience?
We must choose between the behaviourist course of refusing all meaning to the word ‘experience’, and trying to build up perception as a
product of the world and of science, or else we must concede that
experience, too, gives us access to being, in which case it cannot be
treated as a by-product of being. Either experience is nothing or it must
be total.
Let us try to envisage what an organization in depth produced by
cerebral physiology might be. For any given apparent size and convergence, there would appear somewhere in the brain a functional
structure homologous with the organization in depth. But this is in any
case only a given depth, a factual depth, and we still have to become
aware of it. To experience a structure is not to receive it into oneself
passively: it is to live it, to take it up, assume it and discover its immanent signiﬁcance. Thus an experience can never bear the relation to
certain factual conditions that it would bear to its cause24 and, even if
consciousness of distance is produced for a certain value of convergence and a certain size of retinal image, it can depend on these
factors only in so far as they ﬁgure in it. Since we have no express
experience of it, we must conclude that we have a non-thetic* experience of it. Convergence and apparent size are neither signs nor causes
of depth: they are present in the experience of depth in the way that a
motive, even when it is not articulate and separately posited, is present in
a decision. What do we understand by a motive, and what do we mean
we say, for example, that a journey is motivated? We mean thereby that
it has its origin in certain given facts, not in so far as these facts by
themselves have the physical power to bring it about, but in that they
provide reasons for undertaking it. The motive is an antecedent which
acts only through its signiﬁcance, and it must be added that it is the
decision which aﬃrms the validity of this signiﬁcance and gives it its
force and eﬃcacy. Motive and decision are two elements of a situation:
* I.e. not explicitly posited (Translator’s note).
24
In other words: an act of consciousness can have no cause. But we prefer not to introduce the concept of consciousness, which Gestalt psychology might challenge and
which we for our part do not unreservedly accept. We shall stick to the unexceptionable
notion of experience.

301

302 phenomenology of perception
the former is the situation as a fact, the second the situation undertaken. Thus a death motivates my journey because it is a situation in
which my presence is required, whether to console a bereaved family
or to ‘pay one’s last respects’ to the deceased, and, by deciding to make
the journey, I validate this motive which puts itself forward, and I take
up the situation. The relation between the motivating and the motivated is thus reciprocal. Now a similar relationship exists between the
experience of convergence, or of apparent size, and that of depth. They
do not act miraculously as ‘causes’ in producing the appearance of
organization in depth, they tacitly motivate it in so far as they already
contain it in their signiﬁcance, and in so far as they are both already a
certain way of looking at a distance. We have already seen that the
convergence of the eyes is not the cause of depth, and that it itself
presupposes an orientation towards the object placed at a distance. Let
us now concentrate on the notion of apparent size. If we look for a long
time at an illuminated object which will leave behind it an after-image,
and if we focus subsequently on screens placed at varying distances, the
after-image is thrown upon them with a diameter greater in proportion as the screen is farther away.25 The enlarged moon on the horizon
has long been explained by the large number of objects interposed
which emphasize the distance and consequently increase the apparent
diameter. It follows that the phenomenon of ‘apparent size’ and the
phenomenon of distance are two features* of a comprehensive organization of the ﬁeld, that the ﬁrst stands to the second neither in the
relation of sign to meaning, nor in that of cause to eﬀect, but that, like
the motivating to the motivated, they communicate through their signiﬁcance. Apparent size as experienced, instead of being the sign or
indication of a depth invisible in itself, is nothing other than a way of
expressing our vision of depth. Gestalt psychology has indeed contributed to showing that the apparent size of a retreating object does not
vary proportionately to the retinal image, and that the apparent shape
of a disc turning round one of its diameters does not vary as one would
expect according to the geometrical perspective. The object moving
away grows smaller, and the object approaching grows larger, less

quickly for my perception than the physical image on my retina. That is
why the train coming towards us, at the cinema, increases in size much
more than it would in reality. It is also why a hill which seemed high
becomes insigniﬁcant in a photograph. And ﬁnally it is why a disc
placed obliquely to our face resists geometrical perspective, as Cézanne
and other painters have shown by depicting a soup plate seen from the
side with the inside still visible. It has been rightly said that, if perspective distortions were expressly given to us, we should not have to learn
perspective. But Gestalt psychologists talk as if the distortion of the
oblique plate were a compromise between the shape of the plate seen
from above and the geometrical perspective, and as if the apparent size
of the retreating object were a compromise between its apparent
size when within reach and the much smaller one which geometrical
perspective would attribute to it. They talk, in fact, as if constancy of
shape or size were a real constancy, as if there were, besides the physical image of the object on the retina, a ‘mental image’ of the same
object which remained relatively constant while the ﬁrst varied. In
reality, the ‘mental image’ of this ash-tray is neither larger nor smaller
than the physical image of the same object on my retina: there is no
mental image that can be compared, as if it were a thing, with the
physical image, no mental image which has a determinate size relative
to the physical and which stands like a screen between me and the
thing. My perception does not bear upon a content of consciousness; it
bears upon the ash-tray itself. The apparent size of the perceived ashtray is not a measurable size. When I am asked what diameter I see it as
having, I cannot reply to the question as long as I keep both eyes open.
Spontaneously, I shut one eye, I take a measuring instrument, a pencil
held at arm’s length, for example, and I mark on the pencil the size
reached by the ash-tray. In doing this, I must avoid merely saying that I
have reduced the perceived perspective to the geometrical, that I have
altered the proportions of the spectacle, and that I have contracted the
object if it is at a distance or that I have expanded it if it is near at
hand—I must rather say that by breaking up the perceptual ﬁeld and
isolating the ash-tray, by positing it for itself, I have caused size to
appear where hitherto it had no place. The constancy of apparent size
in a retreating object is not the actual permanence of some mental
image of the object capable of resisting the distortions of perspective

303

304 phenomenology of perception
as a ﬁrm object resists pressure. The constancy of circular shape in a plate
is not the resistance of the circle to the ﬂattening of perspective, and
this is why the painter who can represent it only by a real outline on a
real canvas surprises the viewer, although he is trying to render perspective as experienced. When I look at a road which sweeps before me
towards the horizon, I must not say either that the sides of the road are
given to me as convergent or that they are given to me as parallel: they
are parallel in depth. The perspective appearance is not posited, but neither
is the parallelism. I am engrossed in the road itself, and I cling to it through its
virtual distortion, and depth is this intention itself which posits neither
the perspective projection of the road, nor the ‘real’ road. And yet is
not a man smaller at two hundred yards than at ﬁve yards away? He
becomes so if I isolate him from the perceived context and measure his
apparent size. Otherwise he is neither smaller nor indeed equal in size:
he is anterior to equality and inequality; he is the same man seen from farther
away. One can only say that the man two hundred yards away is a much
less distinguishable ﬁgure, that he presents fewer and less identiﬁable
points on which my eyes can fasten, that he is less strictly geared to my
powers of exploration. Again one can say that he less completely occupies my visual ﬁeld, provided that one remembers that the visual ﬁeld
itself is not a measurable area. To say that an object takes up only a small
part of my visual ﬁeld is to say in eﬀect that it does not oﬀer a sufﬁciently rich conﬁguration to absorb completely my power of clear
vision. My visual ﬁeld has no deﬁnite capacity, and it can contain more
or fewer things according as I see ‘at a distance’ or ‘near’. Apparent size
is, therefore, not deﬁnable independently of distance; it is implied by
distance and it also implies distance. Convergence, apparent size and
distance are read oﬀ from each other, naturally symbolize or signify
each other, are the abstract elements of a situation and are, within it,
mutually synonymous, not because the subject of perception posits
objective relations between them, but on the contrary because he does
not posit them separately and therefore has no need to unify them
expressly. Taking the various ‘apparent sizes’ of the retreating object, it
is not necessary to link them in a synthesis if none of them has been
speciﬁcally posited. We ‘have’ the retreating object, we never cease to
‘hold’ it and to have a grip on it, and the increasing distance is not, as
breadth appears to be, an augmenting externality: it expresses merely

space

that the thing is beginning to slip away from the grip of our gaze and is
less closely allied to it. Distance is what distinguishes this loose and
approximate grip from the complete grip which is proximity. We shall
deﬁne it then as we deﬁned ‘straight’ and ‘oblique’ above: in terms of
the situation of the object in relation to our power of grasping it.
It is principally illusions relating to depth which have made us accustomed to considering it as a construction of the understanding. We can
produce them by imposing upon the eyes a certain degree of convergence, as at the stereoscope, or by setting before the subject a perspective drawing. Since in this case I imagine that I see depth when
there is none, is this not because misleading signs have given rise to a
hypothesis, and because generally the alleged vision of distance is
always an interpretation of signs? But the postulate is clear; we suppose
that it is not possible to see what is not there, we therefore deﬁne vision
in terms of sensory impression, missing the original relationship of
motivating and replacing it by one of signifying. We have seen that the
disparity between the retinal images, which stimulates convergence,
does not exist in itself; there is disparity only for a subject who tries to
fuse monocular phenomena similar in structure and who tends
towards synergy. The unity of binocular vision, and with it the depth
without which it cannot come about is, therefore, there from the very
moment at which the monocular images are presented as ‘disparate’.
When I look in the stereoscope, a totality presents itself in which
already the possible order takes shape and the situation is foreshadowed. My motor response takes up this situation. Cézanne said that
the painter in the face of his ‘motif ’ is about ‘to join the aimless hands
of nature’.26 The act of focusing at the stereoscope is equally a response
to the question put by the data, and this response is contained in the
question. It is the ﬁeld itself which is moving towards the most perfect
possible symmetry, and depth is merely an ingredient* in arriving at a
perceptual faith in one single thing. The perspective drawing is not ﬁrst
of all perceived as a drawing on a plane surface, and then organized in
depth. The lines which sweep towards the horizon are not ﬁrst given as
oblique, and then thought of as horizontal. The whole of the drawing

strives towards its equilibrium by delving in depth. The poplar on the
road which is drawn smaller than a man, succeeds in becoming really
and truly a tree only by retreating towards the horizon. It is the drawing itself which tends towards depth as a stone falls downwards. If
symmetry, plenitude and determinacy can be achieved in several ways,
the organization will not be stable, as can be seen in ambiguous
drawings.
Thus Fig. 1 below can be seen either as a cube seen from below with
the face ABCD in the foreground, or as a cube seen from above with the
face EFGH in the foreground, or as a mosaic pattern of ten triangles and
a square. Fig. 2 on the other hand will almost inevitably be seen as a
cube, because that is the only organization which gives it perfect symmetry.27 Depth is born beneath my gaze because the latter tries to see
something. But what is this perceptual genius at work in our visual ﬁeld,
tending always towards the most determinate form? Are we not now
going back to realism? Let us take an example. Organization in depth is
destroyed if I add to the ambiguous drawing not simply any lines (Fig.
3 stubbornly remains a cube) but lines which disunite the elements of
one and the same plane and join up those of diﬀerent planes (Fig. 1).28
What do we mean when we say that these lines themselves bring about
the destruction of depth? Are we not talking the language of
associationism? We do not mean that the line EH (Fig. 1), acting as a
cause, disorganizes the cube into which it is introduced, but that it
induces a general grasp which is not the grasp in depth. It is under-

stood that the line EH itself possesses an individuality only if I grasp it
in that light, if I run over it and trace it out myself. But this grasp and
this delineation are not arbitrary. They are indicated or recommended
by phenomena. The demand here is not an overriding one, simply
because it is a question of an ambiguous ﬁgure, but, in a normal visual
ﬁeld, the segregation of planes and outlines is irresistible; for example,
when I walk along an avenue, I cannot bring myself to see the spaces
between the trees as thing and the trees themselves as a background. It
is certainly I who have the experience of the landscape, but in this
experience I am conscious of taking up a factual situation, of bringing
together a signiﬁcance dispersed among phenomena, and of saying
what they of their own accord mean. Even in cases where the organization is ambiguous and where I can vary it, I do not directly succeed in
doing so: one of the faces of the cube moves into the foreground only
if I ﬁrst look at it and if my gaze make sit its starting point from which
to follow the oblique lines to the second face, which shows up as an
indeterminate background. If I see Fig. 1 as a mosaic pattern, it is on
condition that I ﬁrst of all concentrate my gaze on the centre, and then
distribute it equally and simultaneously over the whole ﬁgure. As
Bergson waits for the lump of sugar to dissolve, I sometimes have to
wait for the organization to come about. All the more is it the case that
in normal perception the signiﬁcance of what is perceived appears to
me as built into it and not constituted by me, and the gaze as a sort of
knowledge machine, which takes things as they need to be taken in
order to become a spectacle, or which divides them up in accordance
with their natural articulations. It is true that the straight line EH
counts as straight only if I run my eye along it, but it is not a matter of
a mental inspection, but of an inspection by the gaze, which means
that my act is not primary or constituting, but called forth or motivated. Every focus is always a focus on something which presents itself
as to be focused upon. When I focus upon the face ABCD of the cube,
that does not only mean that I bring it to the state of being clearly
visible, but also that I make it count as a ﬁgure and as nearer to me
than the other face; in a word I organize the cube, and the gaze is
that perceptual genius underlying the thinking subject which can give
to things the precise reply that they are awaiting in order to exist
before us.

307

308 phenomenology of perception
What, then, to sum up, is seeing a cube? It is, say empiricists,
associating, with the actual aspect of the drawing presented, a set of
other appearances, those which it would present at closer quarters,
from the side, from various angles. But, when I see a cube, I do not
ﬁnd any of these images in myself; they are the small change of a
perception of depth which makes them possible, but which does not
result from them. What, then, is this single act whereby I grasp the
possibility of all these appearances? It is, according to intellectualism, the thought of the cube as a solid made up of six equal faces
and twelve equal lines at right angles to each other—and depth is
nothing but the co-existence of the faces and the equal lines. But
here again we are being given as a deﬁnition of depth what is no
more than a consequence of it. The six faces and twelve equal lines
are not the whole signiﬁcance of depth, and yet this deﬁnition has
no meaning without depth. The six faces and twelve lines can both
co-exist and remain equal for me only if they are arranged in depth.
The act which corrects the appearances, giving to the acute or
obtuse angles the value of right angles, to the distorted sides the
value of a square, is not the idea of the geometrical relations of
equality, and the geometrical mode of being to which they
belong—it is the investing of the object by my gaze which penetrates
and animates it, and shows up immediately the lateral faces as ‘squares
seen askew’, to the extent that we do not even see them in their
diamond-shaped, perspective aspect. This being simultaneously present in experiences which are nevertheless mutually exclusive, this
implication of one in the other, this contraction into one perceptual act
of a whole possible process, constitute the originality of depth. It is the
dimension in which things or elements of things envelop each other,
whereas breadth and height are the dimensions in which they are
juxtaposed.
One cannot, therefore, speak of a synthesis of depth, since a synthesis presupposes, or at least, like the Kantian synthesis, posits discrete
terms, and since depth does not posit the multiplicity of perspective
appearances to be made explicit by analysis, but sees that multiplicity
only against the background of the stable thing. This quasi-synthesis is
elucidated if we understand it as temporal. When I say that I see an
object at a distance, I mean that I already hold it, or that I still hold it, it

space

is in the future or in the past as well as being in space.29 It will perhaps
be said that this is so only for me; in itself the lamp which I perceive
exists at the same time as I do, that distance is between simultaneous
objects, and that this simultaneity is contained in the very meaning of
perception. No doubt. But co-existence, which in fact deﬁnes space, is
not alien to time, but is the fact of two phenomena belonging to the
same temporal wave. As for the relationship of the perceived object to
my perception, it does not unite them in space and outside time: they
are contemporary. The ‘order of co-existents’ is inseparable from the
‘order of sequences’, or rather time is not only the consciousness of a
sequence. Perception provides me with a ‘ﬁeld of presence’30 in the
broad sense, extending in two dimensions: the here-there dimension
and the past-present-future dimension. The second elucidates the ﬁrst.
I ‘hold’, I ‘have’ the distant object without any explicit positing of the
spatial perspective (apparent size and shape) as I still ‘have in hand’31
the immediate past without any distortion and without any interposed
‘recollection’. If we want to talk about synthesis, it will be, as Husserl
says, a ‘transition-synthesis’, which does not link disparate perspectives, but brings about the ‘passage’ from one to the other. Psychology
has involved itself in endless diﬃculties by trying to base memory on
the possession of certain contents or recollections, the present traces
(in the body or the unconscious) of the abolished past, for from these
traces we can never come to understand the recognition of the past as
past. In the same way we shall never come to understand the perception of distance if we start from contents presented, so to speak, all
equidistant, a ﬂat projection of the world, as recollections are a projection of the past in the present. And just as memory can be understood
only as a direct possession of the past with no interposed contents, so
the perception of distance can be understood only as a being in the distance
which links up with being where it appears. Memory is built out of the
progressive and continuous passing of one instant into another, and the
interlocking of each one, with its whole horizon, in the thickness of its

successor. The same continuous transition implies the object as it is out
there, with, in short, its ‘real’ size as I should see it if I were beside it, in
the perception that I have of it from here. Just as there is no possibility
of engaging in any discussion of the ‘conservation of recollections’, but
only of a certain way of seeing time which brings out the past as an
inalienable dimension of consciousness, there is no problem of distance, distance being immediately visible provided that we can ﬁnd the
living present in which it is constituted.
As we pointed out at the beginning, we have to rediscover beneath
depth as a relation between things or even between planes, which is
objectiﬁed depth detached from experience and transformed into
breadth, a primordial depth, which confers upon the other its signiﬁcance, and which is the thickness of a medium devoid of any thing. At
those times when we allow ourselves simply to be in the world without
actively assuming it, or in cases of illness favouring this passive attitude,
diﬀerent planes are no longer distinguishable, and colours are no
longer condensed into surface colours, but are diﬀused round about
objects and become atmospheric colours. For example, the patient who
writes on a sheet of paper has to penetrate a certain thickness of whiteness with his pen before reaching the paper. This voluminosity varies
with the colour in question, and is, as it were, the expression of its
qualitative essence.32 There is, then, a depth which does not yet operate
between objects, which, a fortiori, does not yet assess the distance
between them, and which is simply the opening of perception upon
some ghost thing as yet scarcely qualiﬁed. Even in normal perception
depth is not initially applicable to things. Just as top and bottom, right
and left are not given to the subject with the perceived contents, and
are at each moment constituted with a spatial level in relation to which
things arrange themselves—in the same way depth and size come to
things in virtue of their being situated in relation to a level of distances
and sizes,33 which deﬁnes the far and the near, the great and the small,
before any object arises to provide us with a standard for comparison.
When we say that an object is huge or tiny, nearby or far away, it is
often without any comparison, even implicit, with any other object, or
32

space

even with the size and objective position of our own body, but merely
in relation to a certain ‘scope’ of our gestures, a certain ‘hold’ of the
phenomenal body on its surroundings. If we refused to recognize this
rootedness of sizes and distances, we should be sent from one ‘standard’ object to another and fail ever to understand how sizes or distances
can exist for us. The pathological experience of micropsy or macropsy,
altering as it does the apparent size of all the objects in the ﬁeld, leaves
no standard in relation to which objects can appear either larger or
smaller than usual, and is to be understood only by reference to a preobjective standard of distances and sizes. Thus depth cannot be understood as belonging to the thought of an acosmic subject, but as a
possibility of a subject involved in the world.
This analysis of depth links up with the one which we have tried to
make of height and breadth. If, in this section, we ﬁrst of all set depth
over against the other dimensions, this was merely because they appear,
at ﬁrst sight, to be concerned with the relationships of things among
themselves, whereas depth immediately reveals the link between the
subject and space. But we saw above that in reality the vertical and
horizontal too are ultimately to be deﬁned as the best hold our body can
take upon the world. Breadth and height, as relations between objects,
are derivative, and, viewed in their primary signiﬁcance, they too are
‘existential’ dimensions. We cannot be content to say with Lagneau and
Alain that height and breadth pre-suppose depth because a spectacle on a
single plane supposes the equidistance of all its parts from the plane of
my face: this analysis concerns only breadth, height and depth already
objectiﬁed, and not the experience which opens these dimensions to
us. The vertical and the horizontal, the near and the far are abstract
designations for one single form of being in a situation, and they presuppose the same setting face to face of subject and world.
Movement is a displacement or change of position, even if it cannot
be deﬁned as such. As we initially encountered an idea of position
which deﬁnes it in terms of relationships in objective space, so there is
an objective conception of movement which deﬁnes it in terms of
relations within the world, taking the experience of the world for
granted. And just as we had to trace back the origin of the positing of
space to the pre-objective situation or locality of the subject fastening

311

312 phenomenology of perception
himself on to his environment, so we shall have to rediscover, beneath
the objective idea of movement, a pre-objective experience from
which it borrows its signiﬁcance, and in which movement, still linked
to the person perceiving it, is a variation of the subject’s hold on his
world. When we try to think of movement, and arrive at a philosophy
of movement, we immediately place ourselves in a critical or veriﬁcatory attitude, we ask ourselves what precisely is given to us in movement, we make ready to reject appearances in order to reach the truth
concerning movement, and we remain unaware that it is precisely this
attitude which reduces the phenomenon and must prevent us from
coming to grips with it, because it introduces, with the notion of truth
in itself, assumptions liable to conceal from me the genesis of movement for me. Suppose that I throw a stone. It hurtles across the garden.
For a moment it becomes an indistinct meteor-like object, and then a
stone again when it falls to the ground some distance away. If I want to
think ‘clearly’ about the phenomenon, it has to be decomposed. The
stone itself, I shall say, is in reality not modiﬁed by movement. It is
the same stone that I held in my hand, and that I now ﬁnd again on the
ground at the end of its ﬂight, and therefore it is the same stone that
moved through the air. Movement is merely an accidental attribute of
the moving body, and it is not, so to speak, seen in the stone. It can be
only a change in the relations between the stone and its surroundings.
We can speak of movement only so long as it is the same stone which
persists through the diﬀerent relations with those surroundings. If, on
the other hand, I suppose that the stone is abolished on arriving at
point P, and that another identical stone arises out of nothingness at
point P′ which is as close as we like to make it to the ﬁrst, we no longer
have one single movement, but two. There is, then, no movement
without a moving body which bears it uninterruptedly from start to
ﬁnish. Since it is in no way inherent in the moving body, and consists
wholly in its relations with its surroundings, movement cannot dispense with an external landmark, and indeed there is no way of attributing it strictly to the ‘body in motion’ rather than to the landmark.
Once the distinction has been established between the body in motion
and movement, there is no movement without a moving body, no
movement without an objective landmark, and no absolute movement.
Nevertheless this idea of movement is in fact a negation of movement:

space

to distinguish strictly between movement and the moving object is to
say that strictly speaking the ‘moving body’ does not move. If the stone-inmotion is not in some way diﬀerent from the stone at rest, it is never in
motion (nor for that matter at rest). As soon as we bring in the idea of a
moving body which remains the same throughout its motion, Zeno’s
arguments become valid once more. It is, then, useless to object that we
must not regard motion as a series of discontinuous positions successively occupied in a series of discontinuous instants, and that space and
time are not made up from a collection of discrete elements. For even if
we consider two ultimate instants and two ultimate points, the diﬀerence between them in each case being smaller than any given quantity,
and their diﬀerentiation being at an incipient stage, the idea of a
moving body identical throughout the phases of motion excludes, as a
mere appearance, the phenomenon of ‘shift’, and implies the idea of
a spatial and temporal position always identiﬁable in itself, even if it is
not so for us, and therefore that of a stone which always is and never
changes. Even if we invent a mathematical instrument which allows
account to be taken of an indeﬁnite multiplicity of positions and
instants, it is impossible to conceive in one and the same moving body
the very act of transition which always occurs between two instants
and two positions, in whatever proximity to each other we choose
them. So that, in thinking clearly about movement, I do not understand how it can ever begin for me, and be given to me as a
phenomenon.
And yet I walk, I have the experience of movement in spite of the
demands and dilemmas of clear thought, which means, in deﬁance of
all reason, that I perceive movements without any identical moving
object, without any external landmark and without any relativity. If we
present to a subject alternately two lines of light A and B, the subject
sees a continuous movement from A to B, then from B to A, then again
from A to B and so on, even though no intermediate position or indeed
the extreme positions be given for themselves; we have one single line
ceaselessly moving back and forth. It is, however, possible to bring out
distinctly the extreme positions by quickening up or slowing down the
speed of presentation. The stroboscopic movement then tends to be
broken up: the line appears ﬁrst of all held in position A, then suddenly
frees itself and jumps to position B. If we go on accelerating or slowing

313

314 phenomenology of perception
down the rhythm, the stroboscopic movement comes to an end and we
are left with two simultaneous lines or two successive ones.34 The
perception of positions, therefore, varies inversely as that of movement.
It is even possible to show that movement is never the successive occupation, by a moving body, of every position between two extremes. If,
for the stroboscopic movement, we use white or coloured ﬁgures on a
black background, the space through which the movement extends is
at no time illuminated or coloured by it. If, between
the extreme positions A and B, we interpose a short
rod C, the rod is at no time completed by the passing
movement (Fig. 1). We have not a ‘passage of the
line’, but a pure ‘passage’. If we work with a tachistoscope, the subject often perceives a movement
without being able to say what it is that moves.
Figure 1
When it is a question of real movements, the situation is no diﬀerent: if I watch workmen unloading a lorry and throwing bricks from one to another, I see the man’s arm in its initial and
then in its ﬁnal position, yet, although I do not see it in any intermediate position, I have a vivid perception of its movement. If I quickly
move a pencil across a sheet of paper on which I have marked a point,
at no instant am I conscious of the pencil’s being over the point; I see
none of the intermediate positions and yet I am aware of movement.
Conversely, if I slow down the movement and succeed in not losing
sight of the pencil, at that very moment the impression of motion
disappears.35 The movement disappears at the very moment when it
conforms most closely with the deﬁnition which objective thought
gives of it. Thus one can obtain phenomena in which the moving
object appears only as caught up in movement. For such an object
moving is not passing successively through an indeﬁnite series of positions, it is given only as beginning, pursuing or completing its movement. Consequently, even in cases where the moving object is visible,
movement does not bear to it the relation of an extrinsic entity, a
relation between it and the outside, and we shall be able to have movement without any ﬁxed mark. Indeed, if we project the consecutive
34

space

image of a movement on to a homogeneous ﬁeld containing no object
and having no outline, the movement takes possession of the whole
space, and what is shifting is the whole visual ﬁeld, as in the Haunted
House at the fair. If we project on to the screen the post-image
of a spiral revolving round its centre, in the absence of any ﬁxed
framework, space itself vibrates and dilates from the centre to the
periphery.36 Finally, since motion is no longer a system of relations
external to the object in motion, nothing now prevents us from recognizing absolute movements, such as perception actually presents to us
constantly.
But to this description the objection can always be raised that it is
meaningless. The psychologist rejects the rational analysis of motion,
and when it is pointed out to him that all movement, in order to be
movement, must be movement of something, he replies that ‘that has
no basis in psychological description’.37 But if what the psychologist
describes is a movement, it must be related to some one identical thing
which moves. If I place my watch on the table of my room, and it
suddenly disappears only to reappear a few seconds later on the table in
the next room, I do not say that there has been motion;38 there is
motion only if the intermediate positions have been actually occupied
by the watch. Even though the psychologist may show that stroboscopic motion is produced without any intermediate stimulus between
the extreme positions, and even that the luminous line A does not travel
through the space which separates it from B, that no light is perceived
between A and B during stroboscopic motion, and, in fact, that I do not
see the pencil or the workman’s arm between the two extreme positions, the fact remains that in some way or other the moving body must
have been present at each point of the journey for movement to be
apparent, and though it is not perceptibly present in all these places, it
is thought of as there. What is true of movement is true of change:
when I say that the fakir changes an egg into a handkerchief, or that the
magician changes himself into a bird on the roof of his palace39 I do

not mean merely that an object or a being has disappeared and been
immediately replaced by another. There must be some internal relationship between what is abolished and what comes into being; both
must be two manifestations or two appearances, or two stages of one
and the same something which is presented successively in two
forms.40 In the same way the arrival of movement at a point must be
one with its departure from the ‘adjacent’ point, and this takes place
only if there is an object in motion which simultaneously leaves one
place and occupies another. ‘A something which is apprehended as a
circle would cease to count for us as a circle the moment “roundness”
or the identity of all the diameters, which is essential to the circle,
ceased to be present in it. Whether the circle be perceived or visualized,
is a matter of indiﬀerence; a common speciﬁcness needs to be present
which forces us in either case to characterize as a circle the thing
presented to us, and to distinguish it from any other phenomenon.’41
Similarly when we speak of a sensation of movement, or of a consciousness sui generis of movement, or, like the Gestalt psychologists, of a
global movement, a phenomenon ø in which no moving object and no
particular position of a moving object is given, this is merely verbiage
unless we say how ‘what is given in this sensation or this phenomenon,
or what is grasped through them, is immediately conveyed (dokumentiert) as movement’.42 Perception of movement can be perception of
movement and recognition of it as such, only if it is apprehension of it
with its signiﬁcance as movement, and with all the instants which
constitute it, and in particular with the identity of the object in motion.
Movement, the psychologist replies, is ‘one of those “psychic phenomena” which, like given sense contents such as colour and form, are
related to the object, appearing as objective and not subjective, but
which, unlike other mental data, are not of a static but of a dynamic
nature. For example, the characteristic and speciﬁc “passing eﬀect” is
the ﬂesh and blood of movement which cannot be composed from
ordinary visual contents’.43 Indeed it is not possible to build motion

out of static perceptions. But we are not concerned with this, and there
is not question of trying to reduce movement to a state of rest. The
object at rest also needs identiﬁcation. It cannot be said to be at rest if it
is constantly annihilated and recreated, and if it does not survive
through its diﬀerent instantaneous presentations. The identity to which
we refer is, therefore, anterior to the distinction between movement
and rest. Motion is nothing without a body in motion which describes
and provides it with unity. Here the metaphor of the dynamic phenomenon leads the psychologist astray: it seems to us that a force itself
ensures its unity, but this is because we always suppose that someone is
there to identify it in the development of its eﬀects. ‘Dynamic phenomena’ take their unity from me who live through them, and who
eﬀect their synthesis. Thus we pass from an idea of movement which is
destructive of it to an experience of movement which tries to provide it
with a basis, but also from this experience to an idea without which,
strictly speaking, the experience is meaningless.
We cannot, then, regard either the psychologist or the logician as
vindicated, or rather both must be considered vindicated and we must
ﬁnd a means of recognizing thesis and antithesis as both true. The
logician is right when he demands some constitution of the ‘dynamic
phenomenon’ itself, and a description of movement in terms of the
moving object which we follow through its course—but he is wrong
when he presents the identity of the object in motion as an express
identity, and this he is forced to recognize himself. The psychologist,
on the other hand, when describing phenomena as faithfully as possible, is led in spite of himself to put a moving body into movement,
but he recovers the advantage through the concrete way in which he
conceives this body. In the discussion which we have just followed, and
which serves to illustrate the everlasting debate between psychology
and logic, what, in the last resort, does Wertheimer mean? He means
that the perception of movement is not secondary to the perception of
the moving object, that we have not a perception of the latter here, then
there, followed by an identiﬁcation linking these positions in a succession,44 that their diversity is not subsumed under any transcendent

The identity of the moving object, says Wertheimer, is not the fruit of a conjecture:
‘Here and there this must be the same object’ (p. 187).

unity, and that in short the identity of the object in motion ﬂows
directly from ‘experience’.45 In other words, when the psychologist
speaks of movement as a phenomenon which embraces starting point
A and arrival point B (AB), he does not mean that there is no subject of
movement, but that in no case is the subject of movement an object A
initially given as present and static in its place: in so far as there is
movement, the moving object is caught up in that movement. The
psychologist would no doubt allow that there is, in every movement, if
not an object in motion, at least a mobile entity, provided that this
mobile entity is not confused with any of the static ﬁgures which can
be extracted by halting the movement at any point on its course. And
here he has the advantage over the logician. For, through not having
gone back to the experience of movement independently of any preconceived notion about the world, the logician is talking only about
movement in itself, and expressing the problem of movement in terms
of being, which makes it insoluble in the last resort. If we take, he says,
diﬀerent appearances (Erscheinungen) of movement at diﬀerent points on
its course, they will be appearances of one and the same movement
only if they are appearances of one and the same object in motion, of
one and the same Erscheinende, of one and the same something which
presents itself (darstellt) through them all. But the moving object needs
to be posited as a being apart only if its appearances at diﬀerent points
have themselves been brought into being as discrete perspectives. The
logician knows, on principle, only positing* consciousness, and it is
this postulate, this supposition of a wholly determinate world, of pure
being, which bedevils his conception of multiplicity and consequently
of synthesis. The moving object or rather, as we have called it, the
mobile entity, is not identical beneath the phases of movement, it is
identical in them. It is not because I ﬁnd the same stone on the ground
that I believe in its identity throughout its movement. It is, on the
contrary, because I perceived it as identical during that movement—
with an implicit identity which remains to be described—that I go to
* ‘thetic’ (Translator’s note).
45
It is true that Wertheimer does not say in so many words that the perception of motion
embraces this immediate identity. He says so only implicitly, when he accuses an intellectualist conception, which relates movement to a judgement, of giving us an identity
which ‘ﬂiesst nicht direkt aus dem Erlebnis’ (p. 187).

pick it up and recover it. We shall not ﬁnd in the stone-in-movement
everything that we know in other ways about the stone. If what I
perceive is a circle, says the logician, all its diameters are equal. But, on
this basis, we should equally have to put into the perceived circle all the
properties which the geometers has been able and will be able to
discover in it. Now it is the circle as a thing in the world which
possesses in advance and in itself all the properties which analysis is
destined to discover in it. The circular trunks of trees had already,
before Euclid, the properties that Euclid discovered in them. But in the
circle as a phenomenon, as it appeared to the Greeks before Euclid, the
square of the tangent was not equal to the product of the whole chord
and its exterior portion: the square and the product did not appear in
the phenomenon, nor necessarily did the equal radii. The moving
object, as object of an indeﬁnite series of explicit and concordant perceptions, has properties, the mobile entity has only a style. What is
impossible is that the perceived circle should have unequal diameters
or that movement should exist without any mobile entity. But for all
that, the perceived circle does not have equal diameters because it has
no diameter at all: it is conveyed to me, and is recognizable and distinguishable from any other ﬁgure by its circular physiognomy, and
not by any of the ‘properties’ which positing* thought may
subsequently discover in it. Similarly movement does not necessarily
presuppose a moving object, that is, an object deﬁned in terms of a
collection of determinate properties; it is suﬃcient that it should
include ‘something that moves’, or at the most ‘something coloured’
or ‘luminous’ without any actual colour or light. The logician excludes
this middle term: the radii of the circle must be either equal or
unequal, motion must either have or not have a moving body. But he
can do so only by taking the circle as a thing or by taking movement in
itself. Now we have seen that this amounts to making motion impossible. The logician would have nothing to conceive, not even an
appearance of movement, if there were not a movement anterior to the
objective world which is the source of all our assertions about
movement, if there were not phenomena anterior to being, which
one can recognize, identify, and talk about, in a word, which have a
* ‘thetic’ (Translator’s note).

signiﬁcance, even though they are not yet thematized.46 It is to this
phenomenal layer that the psychologist leads us back. We do not say
that it is irrational or anti-logical. This would be so only of the positing
of a movement without an object in motion. Only the explicit denial of
the moving object would be contrary to the principle of the excluded
middle. We need to say merely that the phenomenal layer is literally
prelogical and will always remain so. Our image of the world can be
made up only in part of actual being, and we must ﬁnd a place in it for
the phenomenal realm which surrounds being on all sides. We are not
asking the logician to take into consideration experiences which, in the
light of reason, are nonsensical or contradictory, we merely want to
push back the boundaries of what makes sense for us, and reset the
narrow zone of thematic signiﬁcance within that of non-thematic signiﬁcance which embraces it. The thematization of movement ends
with the identical object in motion and with the relativity of movement, which means that it destroys movement. If we want to take the
phenomenon of movement seriously, we shall need to conceive a
world which is not made up only of things, but which has in it also
pure transitions. The something in transit which we have recognized as
necessary to the constitution of a change is to be deﬁned only in terms
of the particular manner of its ‘passing’. For example, the bird which
ﬂies across my garden is, during the time that it is moving, merely a
greyish power of ﬂight and, generally speaking, we shall see that things
46

Linke eventually concedes (op. cit., pp. 664–5) that the subject of movement can be
indeterminate (as when we see, in stroboscopic presentation, a triangle moving towards
a circle and being transformed into it), that the object in motion has no need to be
posited by an act of explicit perception, that it is merely a ‘co-target’ or ‘coapprehension’ in the perception of movement, that it is seen only as the backs of objects
or the space behind me are seen, and that ﬁnally the identity of the moving object, like
the unity of the thing perceived, is apprehended through a categorical perception
(Husserl) in which the category is operative without being conceived for itself. But the
notion of categorical perception once more calls the whole of the preceding analysis into
question. For it amounts to introducing non-thetic consciousness into the perception of
movement, that is, as we have shown, it amounts to rejecting not only the a priori as
essential necessity, but also the Kantian notion of synthesis. Linke’s work belongs to, and
is typical of, the second period of Husserlian phenomenology, which marks a transition
from the eidetic method or logicism of the earlier stage to the existentialism of the last
period.

are deﬁned primarily in terms of their ‘behaviour’ and not in terms of
their static ‘properties’. It is not I who recognize, in each of the points
and instants passed through, the same bird deﬁned by explicit characteristics, it is the bird in ﬂight which constitutes the unity of its movement, which changes its place, it is this ﬂurry of plumage still here,
which is already there in a kind of ubiquity, like the comet with its tail.
Pre-objective being, the non-thematized mobile entity sets merely the
problem of implied space and time which we have already discussed.
We said that the parts of space seen as breadth, height or depth, are not
juxtaposed, but that they co-exist because they are all drawn into the
hold that our body takes upon the world. This relation was already
elucidated when we showed that it is temporal before being spatial.
Things co-exist in space because they are present to the same perceiving
subject and enveloped in one and the same temporal wave. But the
unity and individuality of each temporal wave is possible only if it is
wedged in between the preceding and the following one, and if the
same temporal pulsation which produces it still retains its predecessor
and anticipates its successor. It is objective time which is made up of
successive moments. The lived present holds a past and a future within
its thickness. The phenomenon of movement merely displays spatial
and temporal implications in a more striking way. We know of movement and a moving entity without being in any way aware of objective
positions, as we know of an object at a distance and of its true size
without any interpretation, and as we know every moment the place of
an event in the thickness of our past without any express recollection.
Motion is a modulation of an already familiar setting, and once more it
leads us back to our central problem, which is how this setting, which
acts as a background to every act of consciousness, comes to be
constituted.47
47

This problem cannot be posed without already outrunning realism and, for example,
the celebrated descriptions of Bergson. Bergson’s alternative to the multiplicity of things
externally juxtaposed is the ‘multiplicity of fusion and interpenetration’ of consciousness. He proceeds by way of dilution, speaking of consciousness as if it were a liquid in
which instants and positions dissolve. In it he looks for an element in which their
dispersal is really abolished. The indivisible action of my arm as I move it gives me that
movement which I cannot ﬁnd in external space, because my movement, when put back
into my internal life, rediscovers there the unity of inextension. The lived-through which

321

322 phenomenology of perception
The positing of an identical mobile object led to the relativity of
movement. Now that we have reintroduced movement into the object
in motion, this is to be interpreted in one sense only: it is in the
moving object that it begins, and from there spreads into the ﬁeld. I
cannot force myself to see the stone as motionless, and the garden and
myself as in motion. Motion is not a hypothesis, the probability of
Bergson sets over against the thought-about is for him an experience, an immediate
‘datum’. But this is to seek a solution in ambiguity. Space, motion and time cannot be
elucidated by discovering an ‘inner’ layer of experience in which their multiplicity is
erased and really abolished. For if this happens, neither space, nor movement, nor time
remains. The consciousness of my gesture, if it is truly a state of undivided consciousness, is no longer consciousness of movement at all, but an incommunicable quality
which can tell us nothing about movement. As Kant said, external experience is necessary
to internal experience, which is indeed incommunicable, but incommunicable because
meaningless. If, in virtue of the principle of continuity, the past still belongs to the
present and the present already to the past, there is no longer any past or present. If
consciousness snowballs upon itself, it is, like the snowball and everything else, wholly in
the present. If the phases of movement gradually merge into one another, nothing is
anywhere in motion. The unity of time, space and movement cannot come about
through any coalescence, and cannot be understood either by any real operation. If
consciousness is multiplicity, who is to gather together this multiplicity in order to
experience it as such, and if consciousness is fusion, how shall it come to know the
multiplicity of the moments which it fuses together? Against Bergson’s realism, the
Kantian idea of synthesis is seen to be valid, and consciousness as an agent of this
synthesis cannot be confused with any thing at all, even a ﬂuid one. What is for us
primary and immediate, is a ﬂux which does spread outwards like a liquid, but which, in
an active sense, bears itself along, which it cannot do without knowing that it does so, and
without drawing itself together in the same act whereby it bears itself along—it is that
‘time which does not pass’ of which Kant somewhere speaks. For us, then, the unity of
movement is not a real unity. But neither is multiplicity real, and what we object to in the
idea of synthesis in Kant, as in certain Kantian texts of Husserl, is precisely that it
presupposes, at least theoretically, a real multiplicity which consciousness has to surmount. What for us is primary consciousness is not a transcendental Ego freely positing
before itself a multiplicity in itself, and constituting it throughout from start to ﬁnish, it
is an I which dominates diversity only with the help of time, and for whom freedom itself is
a destiny, so that I am never conscious of being the absolute creator of time, of composing the movement through which I live, I have the impression that it is the mobile entity
itself which changes its position, and which eﬀects the passage from one instant or one
position to another. This relative and prepersonal I who provides the basis for the phenomenon of movement, and in general the phenomenon of the real, clearly demands
some elucidation. Let us say for the moment that we prefer, to the notion of synthesis,
that of synopsis, which does not yet point to an explicit positing of diversity.

which is measured as in physical theory by the number of facts which
it co-ordinates. That would give only possible movement, whereas
movement is a fact. The stone is not conceived, but seen, in motion. For
the hypothesis: ‘It is the stone which is moving’ would have no distinctive meaning, and would be indistinguishable from the hypothesis:
‘It is the garden which is moving’, if motion both in fact and for
reﬂection amounted to a mere change of relationships. It therefore
inhabits the stone. And yet are we to recognize the psychologist’s
realism as fully justiﬁed? Are we going to put motion into the stone as a
quality? It does not presuppose any relationship to an expressly perceived object, and remains possible in a perfectly homogeneous ﬁeld.
The fact remains that every object in motion is given in a ﬁeld. Just as
we need a mobile entity in movement, we need a basis for movement.
It has been wrongly asserted that the edges of the visual ﬁeld always
furnish an objectively stable point.48 Once again, the edge of the visual
ﬁeld is not a real line. Our visual ﬁeld is not neatly cut out of our
objective world, and is not a fragment with sharp edges like the landscape framed by the window. We see as far as our hold on things
extends, far beyond the zone of clear vision, and even behind us. When
we reach the limits of the visual ﬁeld, we do not pass from vision to
non-vision: the gramophone playing in the next room, and not
expressly seen by me, still counts in my visual ﬁeld. Conversely, what
we see is always in certain respects not seen: there must be hidden sides
of things, and things ‘behind us’, if there is to be a ‘front’ of things,
and things ‘in front of’ us, in short, perception. The limits of the visual
ﬁeld are a necessary stage in the organization of the world, and not an
objective outline. But it is nevertheless true that an object crosses our
visual ﬁeld, and changes its place in it, and that movement has no
meaning outside this relationship. According as we give to a certain
part of the ﬁeld the value of ﬁgure or background, it appears to us to
be moving or at rest. If we are on a ship sailing along the coast, it is
true, as Leibnitz said, that we can watch the coast ﬂowing by in front of
us, or take it as a ﬁxed point and feel the boat in motion. Do we then
concede the logician his case? Not at all, for to say that motion is a
structural phenomenon is not to say that it is ‘relative’. The very
48

323

324 phenomenology of perception
peculiar relationship which constitutes movement does not exist between
objects, and is one which the psychologist, far from overlooking it,
describes better than the logician. It is the coast which slips by if we
keep our eyes ﬁxed on the rail, and the boat which glides along if we
look at the coast. Of two points of light seen in the dark, one static and
the other moving, it is the one which one is looking at which appears
to be in motion.49 The cloud ﬂoats over the steeple and the river ﬂows
under the bridge, if it is the cloud and the river that we are looking at.
The steeple falls across the sky and the bridge slides over a static river if
we are looking at the steeple or the bridge.
What makes part of the ﬁeld count as an object in motion, and
another as the background, is the way in which we establish our relations with them by the act of looking. The stone ﬂies through the air.
What do these words mean, other than that our gaze, lodged and
anchored in the garden, is attracted by the stone and, so to speak, drags
at its anchors? The relation between the moving object and its background passes through our body. How is this bodily mediation to be
conceived? How does it come about that the relations of objects to it
can diﬀerentiate them as in motion or at rest? Is not our body an object,
and does it not itself need to be determinate in relation to rest and
movement? It is often said that when we move our eyes, objects remain
static for us because we take account of the shift of the eyes and that,
ﬁnding it exactly proportionate to the change of appearances, we conclude in favour of the immobility of objects. In fact, if we are not
conscious of any movement of the eye, as in the case of a passive shift
of the gaze, the object seems to move. If, in paresis of the oculo-motor
muscles, we have the illusion of a movement of the eye, without any
apparent change in the relation of objects to the eye, we think we see a
movement of the object. It seems at ﬁrst as if, the relation of the object
to our eye, as it is imprinted on the retina, being given to consciousness, the state of rest or degree of movement of objects is arrived at by a
process of subtraction, in which we take into account the shift or
49

The laws governing the phenomenon would seem, then, to need more precise statement: what is certain is that there are laws, and that the perception of movement, even
when it is ambiguous, is not arbitrary and depends on the static point. Cf. Duncker, Über
induzierte Bewegung.

immobility of our eye. In fact, this analysis is entirely artiﬁcial, and
such as to conceal from us the real relationship between our body and
the spectacle. When I transfer my gaze from one object to another, I am
unaware of my eye as an object, as a globe set in an orbit, of its
movement or state of rest in objective space, or of what these throw
upon the retina. The ﬁgures for the alleged calculation are not given to
me. The immobility of the thing is not inferred from the act of looking,
it is strictly simultaneous with it, and the two phenomena envelop each
other: what we have is not two terms of an algebraic expression, but
two ‘moments’ in an organization which embraces them both. My eye
for me is a certain power of making contact with things, and not a
screen on which they are projected. The relation of my eye to the object
is not given to me in the form of a geometrical projection of the object in the eye, but as it were a hold taken by my eye upon the object,
indistinct in marginal vision, but closer and more deﬁnite when I focus
upon the object. What I lack when my eye moves passively, is not the
objective representation of its shift in the orbit, which in any case is not
given to me, but the exact gearing of my gaze to objects, without
which they are incapable of ﬁxity, or indeed of genuine movement: for
when I press on my eyeball, I do not perceive a true movement, the
things themselves are not moving, but only a thin ﬁlm on their surface.
In short, in cases of oculo-motor paresis, I do not explain the constancy
of the retinal image in terms of movement on the part of the object, but
I experience that the grip of my gaze on the object does not relax, my
gaze carries it and displaces it along with itself. Thus my eye is never in
the perception of an object. If we can ever speak of movement without
an object in motion, it is pre-eminently in the case of our own body.
The movement of my eye towards the thing upon which it is about to
focus is not the displacement of an object in relation to another object,
but progress towards reality. My eye is in motion or at rest in relation
to a thing which it is approaching or from which it is receding. In so far
as the body provides the perception of movement with the ground or
basis which it needs in order to become established, it is as a power of
perception, rooted in a certain domain and geared to a world. Rest and
movement appear between an object which, in itself, is not determinate
in relation to either, and my body of which, as an object, the same is
true when my body anchors itself in certain objects. Like top and

325

326 phenomenology of perception
bottom, motion is a phenomenon of levels, every movement presupposing a certain anchorage which is variable. So much can validly be
said when we talk obscurely about the relativity of movement. Now
what precisely is the anchorage and how does it constitute a background at rest? It is not an explicit perception. The points of anchorage,
when we focus on them, are not objects. The steeple begins to move
only when I leave the sky in the margin of vision. It is essential to the
alleged ﬁxed points underlying motion that they should not be posited
in present knowledge and that they should always be ‘already there’.
They do not present themselves directly to perception, they circumvent
it and encompass it by a preconscious process, the results of which
strike us as ready made. Cases of ambiguous perception in which we
can at will choose our anchorage are those in which our perception is
artiﬁcially cut oﬀ from its context and its past, in which we do not
perceive with our whole being, in which we play a game with our
body and with that generality which enables it at any time to break
with any historical commitment and to function on its own account.
But although we can break with a human world, we cannot help focusing our eyes—which means that as long as we live we remain committed, if not in a human setting, at least in a physical one—and for any
given focus of the gaze, perception is not arbitrary. Still less is it arbitrary when the life of the body is integrated to our concrete existence. I
can at will see my own train or the train next to it in motion whether
on the one hand I do nothing or on the other consider the illusions of
motion. But ‘when I am playing at cards in my compartment, I see the
neighbouring train move oﬀ, even if it is really mine which is starting;
when I look at the other train and try to pick out someone, then it is my
own train which is set in motion’.50 The compartment which we happen to occupy is ‘at rest’, its walls are ‘vertical’ and the landscape slips
by before our eyes, and on a hill the ﬁrs seen through the window
appear to us to slope. If we stand at the window, we return to the great
world beyond our small one, the ﬁrs straighten themselves and remain
stationary, and the train leans with the slope and speeds through the
countryside. The relativity of motion reduces itself to the power which
we have of changing our domain within the great world. Once

involved in a setting, we see motion appear before us as an absolute.
Provided that we take into account, not only acts of explicit knowledge,
cogitationes, but also that more occult act, always in the past, by which we
gave ourselves a world, provided that we recognize a non-thetic* consciousness, we can allow what the psychologist calls absolute movement without falling into the diﬃculties of realism, and understand the
phenomenon of movement without allowing our logic to destroy it.
We have so far considered, as do traditional philosophy and psychology, only the perception of space, that is, the knowledge that a disinterested
subject might acquire of the spatial relationships between objects and
their geometrical characteristics. And yet, even in analysing this
abstract function, which is far from covering the whole of our experience of space, we have been led to bring out, as the condition of
spatiality, the establishment of the subject in a setting, and ﬁnally his
inherence in a world. In other words, we have been forced to recognize
that spatial perception is a structural phenomenon and is comprehensible only within a perceptual ﬁeld which contributes in its entirety to
motivating the spatial perception by suggesting to the subject a possible anchorage. The traditional problem of the perception of space and
perception generally must be reintegrated into a vaster problem. To ask
how one can, in an explicit act, determine spatial relationships and
objects with their ‘properties’, is to ask a second order question, to give
as primary an act which appears only against the background of an
already familiar world, to admit that one has not yet become conscious
of the experience of the world. In the natural attitude, I do not have
perceptions, I do not posit this object as beside that one, along with their
objective relationships, I have a ﬂow of experiences which imply and
explain each other both simultaneously and successively. Paris for me is
not an object of many facets, a collection of perceptions, nor is it the
law governing all these perceptions. Just as a person gives evidence of
the same emotional essence in his gestures with his hands, in his way
of walking and in the sound of his voice, each express perception
occurring in my journey through Paris—the cafés, people’s faces, the
poplars along the quays, the bends of the Seine—stands out against the
* I.e., non-positing (Translator’s note).

328 phenomenology of perception
city’s whole being, and merely conﬁrms that there is a certain style or a
certain signiﬁcance which Paris possesses. And when I arrived there for
the ﬁrst time, the ﬁrst roads that I saw as I left the station were, like the
ﬁrst words spoken by a stranger, simply manifestations of a still
ambiguous essence, but one already unlike any other. Just as we do not
see the eyes of a familiar face, but simply its look and its expression, so
we perceive hardly any object. There is present a latent signiﬁcance,
diﬀused throughout the landscape or the city, which we ﬁnd in something speciﬁc and self-evident which we feel no need to deﬁne. Only
the ambiguous perceptions emerge as explicit acts: perceptions, that is,
to which we ourselves give a signiﬁcance through the attitude which
we take up, or which answer questions which we put to ourselves.
They cannot be of any use in the analysis of the perceptual ﬁeld, since
they are extracted from it at the very outset, since they presuppose it and
since we come by them by making use of precisely those set groupings
with which we have become familiar in dealing with the world.
An initial perception independent of any background is inconceivable. Every perception presupposes, on the perceiving subject’s part, a
certain past, and the abstract function of perception, as a coming
together of objects, implies some more occult act by which we elaborate our environment. Under mescalin it happens that approaching
objects appear to grow smaller. A limb or other part of the body, the
hand, mouth or tongue seems enormous, and the rest of the body is
felt as a mere appendage to it.51 The walls of the room are 150 yards
apart, and beyond the walls is merely an empty vastness. The stretchedout hand is as high as the wall, and external space and bodily space are
divorced from each other to the extent that the subject has the impression of eating ‘from one dimension to the other’.52 Sometimes motion
is no longer seen, and people seem to be transported magically from
one place to another.53 The subject is alone and forlorn in empty space,
‘he complains that all he can see clearly is the space between things,
and that this space is empty. Objects are in a way still there, but not as
one would expect. . . .’54 Men are like puppets and their movements

are performed in a dreamlike slow-motion. The leaves on the trees lose
their armature and organization: every point on the leaf has the same
value as every other.55 One schizophrenic says: ‘A bird is twittering in
the garden. I can hear the bird and I know that it is twittering, but that
it is a bird and that it is twittering, the two things seem so remote from
each other. . . . There is a gulf between them, as if the bird and the
twittering had nothing to do with each other.’56 Another schizophrenic
can no longer manage to ‘understand’ the clock, that is, in the ﬁrst
place the movement of the hands from one position to another, and
especially the connection of this movement with the drive of the
mechanism, the ‘working’ of the clock.57 These disturbances do not
aﬀect perception as knowledge of the world: the oversized parts of the
body, the too small objects near at hand are not posited as such; for the
patient the walls of the room are not far from each other as are the two
ends of a football ﬁeld for a normal person. The subject is well aware
that his food and his own body reside in the same space, since he takes
food with his hand. Space is ‘empty’, and yet all the objects of perception are there. The disturbance does not aﬀect the information which
may be derived from perception, but discloses beneath ‘perception’ a
deeper life of consciousness. Even where there is failure to perceive, as
with regard to movement, the perceptual deﬁciency appears as no
more than an extreme case of a more general disturbance of the process
of relating phenomena to each other. There is a bird and there is
twittering, but the bird no longer twitters. There is a movement of the
clock hands, and a spring, but the clock no longer ‘goes’. In the same
way certain parts of the body are enlarged out of all proportion, and
adjacent objects made too small because the whole picture no longer
forms a system. Now, if the world is atomized or dislocated, this is
because one’s own body has ceased to be a knowing body, and has
ceased to draw together all objects in its one grip; and this debasement
of the body into an organism must itself be attributed to the collapse of
time, which no longer rises towards a future but falls back on itself.

organism (Körper) and the soul is dead. . . . I hear and see, but no longer
know anything, and living is now a problem for me. . . . I now live on

go in the room, but for me time no longer passes. . . . Thinking has
changed, and there is no longer any style. . . . What is the future? It can
no longer be reached. . . . Everything is in suspense. . . . Everything is
monotonous, morning, noon, evening, past, present and future. Everything is constantly beginning all over again.’58 The perception of space
is not a particular class of ‘states of consciousness’ or acts. Its modalities
are always an expression of the total life of the subject, the energy with
which he tends towards a future through his body and his world.59
We thus ﬁnd ourselves led to a broadening of our investigation.
Once the experience of spatiality is related to our implantation in the
world, there will always be a primary spatiality for each modality of
this implantation. When, for example, the world of clear and articulate
objects is abolished, our perceptual being, cut oﬀ from its world,
evolves a spatiality without things. This is what happens in the night.
Night is not an object before me; it enwraps me and inﬁltrates through
all my senses, stiﬂing my recollections and almost destroying my personal identity. I am no longer withdrawn into my perceptual look-out
from which I watch the outlines of objects moving by at a distance.
Night has no outlines; it is itself in contact with me and its unity is the
mystical unity of the mana. Even shouts or a distant light people it only
vaguely, and then it comes to life in its entirety; it is pure depth without foreground or background, without surfaces and without any distance separating it from me.60 All space for the reﬂecting mind is
sustained by thinking which relates its parts to each other, but in this
case the thinking starts from nowhere. On the contrary, it is from the
heart of nocturnal space that I become united with it. The distress felt
by neuropaths in the night is caused by the fact that it brings home to
us our contingency, the uncaused and tireless impulse which drives us

to seek an anchorage and to surmount ourselves in things, without any
guarantee that we shall always ﬁnd them. But there is a still more
striking experience of unreality than night provides: I can at night
retain the general setting of the daytime, as when I grope about in my
ﬂat, and in any case night is included in the general framework of
nature, and there is something reassuring and earthly even in pitch
black space. During sleep, on the other hand, I hold the world present
to me only in order to keep it at a distance, and I revert to the subjective
sources of my existence. The phantasms of dreams reveal still more
eﬀectively that general spatiality within which clear space and observable objects are embedded. Let us consider, for example, the themes of
rising and falling so frequently met in dreams, as indeed in mythology
and poetry. It is well known that the appearance of these themes in
dreams can be related to concomitant respiratory states or sexual
drives, and it is a ﬁrst step to recognize the vital and sexual signiﬁcance
of up and down. But these explanations do not get us very far, for
dreamed-of elevation or falling are not to be found in visible space, as
are the waking perceptions associated with desire and the movement of
breathing. We must understand why at a given moment the dreamer
lends himself wholly to the physical facts of respiration and desire, and
thus ﬁlls them with a general and symbolic signiﬁcance to the extent of
seeing them appear in the dream simply as an image—for example, the
image of a great bird hovering, which, hit by a shot, falls and is reduced
to a small heap of charred paper. We must understand how respiratory
or sexual events, which have a place in objective space, are drawn away
from it in the dream state, and settle in a diﬀerent theatre. But we shall
not succeed in doing so unless we endow the body, even in the waking
state, with an emblematic value. Between our emotions, desires and
bodily attitudes, there is not only a contingent connection or even an
analogical relationship: if I say that in disappointment I am downcast, it
is not only because it is accompanied by gestures expressing prostration in virtue of the laws governing nervous mechanisms, or because I
discover between the objects of my desire and my desire itself the same
relationship as exists between an object placed high above me and my
gesture towards it. The movement upwards as a direction in physical
space, and that of desire towards its objective are mutually symbolical,
because they both express the same essential structure of our being,

331

332 phenomenology of perception
being situated in relation to an environment, of which we have already
stated that this structure alone gives signiﬁcance to the directions up
and down in the physical world. When we speak of an elevated or a low
morality, we are not extending to the mental a relationship the full
signiﬁcance of which is to be found only in the physical world, we are
making use of ‘a direction of signiﬁcance which, so to speak, runs
through the various regional spheres and receives a particular signiﬁcance (spatial, auditory, spiritual, mental, etc.) in each one’.61 The
phantasms of dreaming, of mythology, the favourite images of each
man or indeed poetic imagery, are not linked to their meaning by a
relation of sign to signiﬁed, like the one existing between a telephone
number and the name of the subscriber; they really contain their meaning, which is not a notional meaning, but a direction of our existence.
When I dream that I am ﬂying or falling, the whole signiﬁcance of the
dream is contained in the ﬂight or the fall, as long as I do not reduce
them to their physical appearance in the waking world, and so long as I
take them with all their existential implications. The bird which hovers,
falls and becomes a handful of ash, does not hover and fall in physical
space; it rises and falls with the existential tide running through it, or
again it is the pulse of my existence, its systole and diastole. The level of
this tide at each moment conditions a space peopled with phantasms,
just as, in waking life, our dealings with the world which is oﬀered to
us condition a space peopled with realities. There is a determining of
up and down, and in general of place, which precedes ‘perception’.
Life and sexuality haunt their world and their space. Primitive peoples,
in so far as they live in a world of myth, do not overstep this existential
space, and this is why for them dreams count just as much as perceptions. There is a mythical space in which directions and positions are
determined by the residence in it of great aﬀective entities. For primitive man, knowing the whereabouts of the tribal encampment does not
consist in locating it in relation to some object serving as a landmark:
for it is the landmark of all landmarks—it is to tend towards it as
towards the natural abode of a certain peace or a certain joyfulness, just
as, for me, to know where my hand is is to link up with that agile
power which is for the moment dormant, but which I can take up and

rediscover as my own. For the augur, right and left are the sources of
the lawful and the forbidden, just as for me my right hand and my left
are respectively the incarnations of my skill and my awkwardness. In
dreaming as in myth we learn where the phenomenon is to be found, by
feeling that towards which our desire goes out, what our hearts dreads,
on what our life depends. Even in waking life things are no diﬀerent. I
arrive in a village for my holidays, happy to leave my work and my
everyday surroundings. I settle in the village, and it becomes the centre
of my life. The low level of the river, gathering in the maize crop or
nutting are events for me. But if a friend comes to see me bringing
news from Paris, or if the press and radio tell me that war threatens, I
feel an exile in the village, shut oﬀ from real life, pushed far away from
everything. Our body and our perception always summon us to take as
the centre of the world that environment with which they present us.
But this environment is not necessarily that of our own life. I can ‘be
somewhere else’ while staying here, and if I am kept far away from
what I love, I feel out of touch with real life. The Bovary mentality and
certain forms of home-sickness are examples of life which has become
decentred. The maniac, on the other hand, is centred wherever he is:
‘his mental space is broad and luminous, and his thought, sensitive to
all objects which present themselves, ﬂies from one to the other and is
caught up in their movement’.62 Besides the physical and geometrical
distance which stands between myself and all things, a ‘lived’ distance
binds me to things which count and exist for me, and links them to
each other. This distance measures the ‘scope’ of my life at every
moment.63 Sometimes between myself and the events there is a certain
amount of play (Spielraum), which ensures that my freedom is preserved
while the events do not cease to concern me. Sometimes, on the other
hand, the lived distance is both too small and too great: the majority of
the events cease to count for me, while the nearest ones obsess me.
They enshroud me like night and rob me of my individuality and
freedom. I can literally no longer breathe; I am possessed.64 At the same

time events conglomerate among themselves. One patient feels icy
blasts of wind, a smell of chestnuts and the coolness of rain. Perhaps, he
says, ‘at that very moment a person undergoing suggestions, as I was,
was walking in the rain past a roast chestnut stall’.65 A schizophrenic,
who is under the care of both Minkowski and a village priest, thinks
that they have met to discuss him.66 An old schizophrenic woman
thinks that someone who is very like someone else has known her.67
The shrinkage of lived space, which leaves no margin to the patient,
leaves no room for chance. Like space, causality, before being a relation
between objects, is based on my relation to things. The ‘shortcircuits’68 of delirious causality, no less than the long causal chains of
methodical thought, express ways of existing:69 ‘the experience of
space is interwoven . . . with all the other modes of experience and all
the other psychic data.’70 Clear space, that impartial space in which all
objects are equally important and enjoy the same right to existence, is
not only surrounded, but also thoroughly permeated by another spatiality thrown into relief by morbid deviations from the normal. A
schizophrenic patient, in the mountains, stops before a landscape. After
a short time he feels a threat hanging over him. There arises within him
a special interest in everything surrounding him, as if a question were
being put to him from outside to which he could ﬁnd no answer.
Suddenly the landscape is snatched away from him by some alien force.
It is as if a second sky, black and boundless, were penetrating the blue
sky of evening. This new sky is empty, ‘subtle, invisible and terrifying’.
Sometimes it moves in the autumn landscape and at other times the
landscape too moves. Meanwhile, says the patient, ‘a question is being
be something nebulous around him and he feels to be trembling; and when the voices are
particularly frequent and numerous, the atmosphere round him is saturated with a kind of
ﬁre, and this produces a sort of oppression inside the heart and lungs and something in
the nature of a mist round about his head.’ Minkowski, Le Problème des Hallucinations et le

constantly put to me; it is, as it were, an order either to rest or die, or
else to push on further’.71 This second space which cuts across visible
space is the one which is ceaselessly composed by our own way of
projecting the world, and the schizophrenic’s trouble consists simply
in the fact that the permanent project becomes dissociated from the
objective world as the latter is presented to perception, and withdraws,
so to speak, within itself. The schizophrenic no longer inhabits the
common property world, but a private world, and no longer gets as far
as geographical space: he dwells in ‘the landscape space’,72 and the
landscape itself, once cut oﬀ from the common property world, is
considerably impoverished. Hence the schizophrenic questioning:
everything is amazing, absurd or unreal, because the impulse of existence towards things has lost its energy, because it appears to itself in all
its contingency and because the world can no longer be taken for
granted. In so far as the natural space talked about by traditional psychology is by contrast reassuring and self-evident, this is because existence rushes towards it, and being absorbed in it, is unaware of itself.
The description of human space could be developed indeﬁnitely.73 It
is clear what fault objective thought will always ﬁnd with it: have these
descriptions any philosophical value? That is to say: do they teach us
anything concerning the structure itself of consciousness, or do they
present us merely with contents of human experience? Are the spaces
belonging to dreams, myths and schizophrenia genuine spaces; can
they exist and be thought of by themselves, or do they not rather
presuppose, as the condition of their possibility, geometrical space and
with it the pure constituting consciousness which deploys it? The left,

One might show, for example, that aesthetic perception too opens up a new spatiality,
that the picture as a work of art is not in the space which it inhabits as a physical thing
and as a coloured canvas. That the dance evolves in an aimless and unorientated space,
that it is a suspension of our history, that in the dance the subject and his world are no
longer in opposition, no longer stand out one against the background of the other, that in
consequence the parts of the body are no longer thrown into relief as in natural experience: the trunk is no longer the ground from which movements arise and to which they
sink back once performed; it now governs the dance and the movements of the limbs are
its auxiliaries.

335

336 phenomenology of perception
the area associated in the primitive mind with misfortune and ill
omen—or in my own body the side associated with awkwardness—
becomes speciﬁcally a direction only if I am ﬁrst of all capable of
conceiving its relation to the right, and it is this relation which ultimately gives a spatial signiﬁcance to the terms between which it stands. It
is not, so to speak, with his anguish or his joy that primitive man ‘aims
at’ a certain space, as it is not with my pain that I know where my
injured foot is: anguish, joy and pain experienced are related to a
locality in objective space in which their empirical conditions are to be
found. But for this agile consciousness, free in relation to all contents
and deploying them in space, those contents would never be anywhere
at all. If we think about the mythical experience of space, and if we ask
what it means, we shall necessarily ﬁnd that it rests on the consciousness of a single objective space, for a space not objective and not
unique would not be a space: is it not of the essence of space to be the
absolute ‘outside’, correlative to, but also the negation of, subjectivity,
and is it not of its essence to embrace every being that one can imagine,
since anything that one might want to posit outside it would by that
very fact be in relation to it, and therefore in it? The dreamer dreams,
and that is why his respiratory movements and sexual drives are not
taken for what they are, why they break away from the moorings
which tie them up with the world and ﬂoat before him in the form of
dreams. But what precisely does he in fact see? Are we to believe his
account of it? If he is to know what he sees and to understand his
dream himself, he will have to awaken. Immediately sexuality will
repair to its genital retreat, anxiety and its attendant phantasms will
become once more what they have always been: some respiratory
obstruction at a point in the chest. The murky space which invades the
schizophrenic’s world cannot substantiate its claim to be a space without being related to clear space. If the patient maintains that there is a
second space round about him, we must ask him: but where is it? In his
eﬀorts to locate this phantom, he will conjure it away as a phantom.
And since, as he himself admits, objects are uninterruptedly present, he
always retains, with clear space, the means of exorcising these spectres
and returning to the everyday world. The phantoms are fragments
drawn from the clear world and borrow from it such standing as they
are capable of enjoying. In the same way, when we try to base

space

geometrical space, along with its relationships within the world, on the
primary spatiality of existence, it will be objected that thought knows
only itself or things, that a spatiality of the subject is inconceivable, and
that consequently the case we are putting is strictly meaningless. It is
true, we shall reply, that it has no thematic or explicit meaning, and
that it dissolves under objective thought. But it has a nonthematic or
implicit meaning, and this is not a lesser meaning, for objective thought
itself draws on the non-reﬂective, and presents itself as an explicit
expression of non-reﬂective consciousness, so that radical reﬂection
cannot consist in thematizing as parallel entities the world, or space,
and the non-temporal subject which thinks of them, but must go
further back and seize this thematizing act itself with the horizons of
implication which give it its signiﬁcance. If reﬂection consists in seeking the ﬁrst-hand, or that by which the rest can exist and be thought
about, it cannot conﬁne itself within objective thought, but must think
about those thematizing acts which posit objective thought, and must
restore their context. In other words, objective thought rejects the
alleged phenomena of dreams, myths and of existence generally,
because it ﬁnds that it cannot think clearly about them, and that they
mean nothing that can be thematized. It rejects the fact or the real in
the name of the possible and the self-evident. But it fails to see that the
self-evident itself is founded on a fact. Analytical reﬂection believes that
it knows what the dreamer or the schizophrenic experience better than
the dreamer or the schizophrenic himself. What is more, the philosopher believes that, in reﬂection, he has a better knowledge of what he
perceives than he has in perception itself. And it is under these circumstances alone that he is able to reject human spaces as confused appearances of the one true, objective space. But by doubting the testimony of
other people about themselves, or of one’s own perception about itself,
he deprives himself of the right to declare absolutely true what he
apprehends as self-evident, even if, in this self-evidence, he is conscious
of having a pre-eminent understanding of the dreamer, the madman or
perception. We cannot have it both ways: either the person who
experiences something knows at the time what he is experiencing, in
which case the madman, the dreamer or the subject of perception must
be taken at their word, and we merely need to conﬁrm that their
language in fact expresses what they are experiencing. Or else the

337

338 phenomenology of perception
person with the experience is no judge of what he experiences, and in
that case the test of self-evidence may be an illusion. In order to divest
the experience of dreams, myths or perception of all positive value, and
in order to reintegrate these various spaces to geometrical space, we
must to all intents and purposes deny that people ever dream, or that
they ever go mad, or ever really and truly perceive anything. As long as
we allow the existence of dreams, insanity or perception, at least as so
many forms of absence of reﬂection—and how can we not do so if we
want to leave some value to the testimony of consciousness, without
which no truth is possible?—we have no right to level all experiences
down to a single world, all modalities of existence down to a single
consciousness. In order to do so, we should need a higher court of
appeal to which to submit perceptual and phantasmal consciousness, a
self more intimate with myself than the self which thinks up my dream
or my perception when I conﬁne myself to dreaming or perceiving,
which possesses the true substance of my dream and my perception
when I have only the appearance of it. But the distinction itself between
the appearance and the reality is made neither in the world of the myth,
nor in the diseased or infantile one. The myth holds the essence within
the appearance; the mythical phenomenon is not a representation, but
a genuine presence. The daemon of rain is present in each drop which
falls after the incantation, as the soul is present in each part of the body.
Every ‘apparition’ (Erscheinung) is in this case an incarnation,74 and each
entity is deﬁned not so much in terms of ‘properties’ as of physiognomic characteristics. So much is validly meant when we talk about
infantile and primitive animism: not that the child and primitive man
perceive objects, which they try, as Comte says, to explain by intentions or forms of consciousness—consciousness, like the object,
belongs to positing thought—but because things are taken for the
incarnation of what they express, and because their human signiﬁcance
is compressed into them and presents itself literally as what they mean.
A shadow passing or the creaking of branches have each a meaning;
everywhere there are warnings with no one who issues them.75 Since
mythical consciousness has not yet arrived at the notion of a thing or of
74

objective truth, how can it undertake a critical examination of that
which it thinks it experiences; where can it ﬁnd a ﬁxed point at which
to stop and become aware of itself as pure consciousness, and perceive,
beyond its phantasms, the real world? A schizophrenic feels that a
brush placed near his window is coming nearer to him and entering
his head, and yet he never ceases to be aware that the brush is over
there.76 If he looks towards the window, he still perceives it. The brush,
as an identiﬁable term in an explicit perception, is not in the patient’s
head as a material mass. But the patient’s head is for him not that object
which everyone can see, and which he himself sees in a mirror: it is the
listening and observing post which he feels at the top of his body, that
power of joining up with all objects through sight and hearing. In the
same way, the brush which presents itself to the senses is merely an
envelope or a phantom. The true brush, the stiﬀ, prickly entity which is
incarnated in these appearances, is concentrated in the gaze; it has
moved from the window, leaving there only its lifeless shell. No appeal
to explicit perception can arouse the patient from this dream, since he
has no quarrel with explicit perception, and holds only that it proves
nothing against what he experiences. ‘Can’t you hear my voices?’ a
patient asks the doctor; and she comes resignedly to the conclusion: ‘I
am the only one who hears them then.’77 What protects the sane man
against delirium or hallucination, is not his critical powers, but the
structure of his space: objects remain before him, keeping their distance and, as Malebranche said speaking of Adam, touching him only
with respect. What brings about both hallucinations and myths is a
shrinkage in the space directly experienced, a rooting of things in our
body, the overwhelming proximity of the object, the oneness of man
and the world, which is, not indeed abolished, but repressed by everyday perception or by objective thought, and which philosophical consciousness rediscovers. It is true that if I reﬂect on the consciousness of
positions and directions in myths, dreams and in perception, if I posit
and establish them in accordance with the methods of objective thinking, I bring to light in them once more the relationships of geometrical
space. The conclusion from this is not that they were there already, but

340 phenomenology of perception
on the contrary that genuine reﬂection is not of this kind. In order to
realize what is the meaning of mythical or schizophrenic space, we
have no means other than that of resuscitating in ourselves, in our
present perception, the relationship of the subject and his world which
analytical reﬂection does away with. We must recognize as anterior to
‘sense-giving acts’ (Bedeutungsgebende Akten) of theoretical and positing
thought, ‘expressive experiences’ (Ausdruckserlebnisse); as anterior to the
sign signiﬁcance (Zeichen-Sinn), the expressive signiﬁcance (AusdrucksSinn), and ﬁnally as anterior to any subsuming of content under form,
the symbolical ‘pregnancy’78 of form in content.
Does this mean that psychologism is vindicated? Since there are as
many spaces as there are distinct spatial experiences, and since we do
not allow ourselves to anticipate, in infantile, diseased or primitive
experience, the forms of adult, normal and civilized experience, are we
not imprisoning each type of subjectivity, and ultimately each consciousness, in its own private life? Have we not substituted for the
rationalist cogito which discovers a universal constituting consciousness
in myself, the psychologist’s cogito, which remains incommunicable
within the experience of its life? Are we not deﬁning subjectivity as the
identity of each person with that experience? Is it not the case that
inquiry into the nature of space and, generally speaking, into nascent
experience, prior to their objectiﬁcation, and the decision to scrutinize
experience itself for its signiﬁcance, in short phenomenology, ends
with the negation of being and signiﬁcance? Are not mere appearance
and opinion being brought back under the name of the phenomenon?
Is not the origin of precise knowledge being identiﬁed with a decision
as unwarrantable as the one which shuts up the madman in his madness, and is not the last word of this wisdom to lead us back to the
anguish of idle and solitary subjectivity? These are doubts which need
to be dispelled. Mythical or dream-like consciousness, insanity and
perception are not, in so far as they are diﬀerent, hermetically sealed
within themselves; they are not small islands of experience cut oﬀ from
each other, and from which there is no escape. We have refused to
make geometrical space immanent in mythical space, and generally, to

78

Cassirer, op. cit., p. 80.

space

subordinate all experience to an absolute consciousness of this experience, a consciousness which would assign to it its place in the general
scheme of truth, because unity of experience thus understood makes
its variety incomprehensible. But mythical consciousness does indeed
open on to a horizon of possible objectiﬁcations. Primitive man lives
his myths against a suﬃciently articulate perceptual background for the
activities of daily life, ﬁshing, hunting and dealings with civilized
people, to be possible. The myth itself, however diﬀuse, has an identiﬁable signiﬁcance for primitive man, simply because it does form a
world, that is, a whole in which each element has meaningful relations
with the rest. It is true that mythical consciousness is not a consciousness of any thing. That is to say that subjectively it is a ﬂux, that it does
not become static and thus does not know itself. Objectively, it does
not posit before itself terms deﬁnable as a certain number of properties,
which can be isolated from one another and which are in fact interlinked. But it is not borne away by each of its pulsations, otherwise it
would not be conscious of anything at all. It does not stand back from
its noemata, but on the other hand, if it passed away with each one of
them, and if it did not tentatively suggest objectiﬁcation, it would not
crystallize itself in myths. We have tried to rescue mythical consciousness from those premature rationalizations which, as with Comte, for
example, make the myth incomprehensible, because they look to it for
an explanation of the world and an anticipation of science, whereas it is
a projection of existence and an expression of the human condition.
But understanding myth is not believing in it, and if all myths are true,
it is in so far as they can be set in a phenomenology of mind which
shows their function in arriving at awareness, and which ultimately
bases their own signiﬁcance on the signiﬁcance they have for the
philosopher.
In the same way, though it is indeed from the dreamer that I was last
night that I require an account of the dream, the dreamer himself oﬀers
no account, and the person who does so is awake. Bereft of the waking
state, dreams would be no more than instantaneous modulations, and
so would not even exist for us. During the dream itself, we do not leave
the world behind: the dream space is segregated from the space of clear
thinking, but it uses all the latter’s articulations; the world obsesses us
even during sleep, and it is about the world that we dream. Similarly it

341

342 phenomenology of perception
is round about the world that insanity gravitates. Leaving aside those
morbid, dream-like or delirious states which endeavour to build a
private domain out of fragments of the macrocosm, we can say that the
most advanced states of melancholia, in which the patient settles in the
realm of death and, so to speak, takes up his abode there, still make use
of the structures of being in the world, and borrow from it an element
of being indispensable to its own denial. This link between subjectivity
and objectivity, which already exists in mythical or childlike
consciousness, and which still survives in sleep or insanity, is to be
found, a fortiori, in normal experience. I never wholly live in varieties
of human space, but am always ultimately rooted in a natural and
non-human space. As I walk across the Place de la Concorde, and think
of myself as totally caught up in the city of Paris, I can rest my eyes on
one stone of the Tuileries wall, the Square disappears and there is then
nothing but this stone entirely without history: I can, furthermore,
allow my gaze to be absorbed by this yellowish, gritty surface, and then
there is no longer even a stone there, but merely the play of light upon
an indeﬁnite substance. My total perception is not compounded of
such analytical perceptions, but it is always capable of dissolving into
them, and my body, which through my habits ensures my insertion
into the human world, does so only by projecting me in the ﬁrst place
into a natural world which can always be discerned underlying the
other, as the canvas underlies the picture and makes it appear
unsubstantial. Even if there is perception of what is desired through
desire, loved through love, hated through hate, it always forms round a
sensible nucleus, however small, and it is in the sensible that its veriﬁcation and its fullness are found. We have said that space is existential; we
might just as well have said that existence is spatial, that is, that through
an inner necessity it opens on to an ‘outside’, so that one can speak of a
mental space and a ‘world of meanings and objects of thought which
are constituted in terms of those meanings’.79 Human spaces present
themselves as built on the basis of natural space, and ‘non-objectifying
acts’, to speak the language of Husserl, as based on ‘objectifying acts’.80
The novelty of phenomenology does not lie in denying the unity of

space

experience, but in ﬁnding a diﬀerent basis for it than does classical
rationalism. For objectifying acts are not representations. Natural and
primordial space is not geometrical space, nor, correspondingly, is the
unity of experience guaranteed by any universal thinker arraying its
contents before me and ensuring that I possess complete knowledge of,
and exercise complete power over it. It is merely foreshadowed by the
horizons of possible objectiﬁcation, and it frees me from every particular setting only because it ties me to the world of nature or the in-itself,
which includes all of them. We must contrive to understand how, at a
stroke, existence projects round itself worlds which hide objectivity
from me, at the same time fastening upon it as the aim of the teleology
of consciousness, by picking out these ‘worlds’ against the background
of one single natural world.
If myths, dreams and illusion are to be possible, the apparent and
the real must remain ambiguous in the subject as in the object. It has
often been said that consciousness, by deﬁnition, admits of no separation of appearance and reality, and by this we are to understand
that, in our knowledge of ourselves, appearance is reality: if I think I
see or feel, I indubitably see or feel, whatever may be true of the
external object. Here reality appears in its entirety, real being and
appearance are one, and there is no reality other than the appearance.
If this is true, there is no possibility that illusion and perception
should have the same appearance, that my illusions should be perceptions with no object or my perceptions true hallucinations. The truth
of perception and the falsity of illusion must be implanted in them
in the shape of some intrinsic characteristic, for otherwise the testimony of the other senses, of later experience, or of other people,
which would remain the only possible criterion, would then become
unreliable, and we should never be aware of a perception or an
illusion as such. If the whole being of my perception and the whole
being of my illusion lies in the way they appear, then the truth
which deﬁnes one and the falsity which deﬁnes the other must be
equally apparent. There will be between them, therefore, a structural
diﬀerence. A true perception will simply be true perception. Illusion will
be no perception at all, and certainty will have to extend from the
vision or sensation as conceived to perception as constitutive of an
object. The transparency of consciousness implies the immanence

343

344 phenomenology of perception
and absolute certainty of the object. Yet it is of the nature of illusion
not to present itself as such, and it is necessary that I should be able,
if not to perceive an unreal object, at least to lose sight of its unreality; it is necessary that there should be at least unawareness of failure
to perceive, that the illusion should not be what it seems to be, and
that for once the reality of an act of consciousness should be beyond
its appearance.
Are we then to separate appearance and reality within the subject?
The diﬃculty is that once the break is made, it is irreparable: the
clearest appearance can henceforth be misleading, and this time it is the
phenomenon of truth which becomes impossible. We are not faced
with a choice between a philosophy of immanence or a rationalism
which accounts only for perception and truth, and a philosophy of
transcendence or absurdity which accounts only for illusion and error.
We know that there are errors only because we possess truth, in the
name of which we correct errors and recognize them as errors. In the
same way the express recognition of a truth is much more than
the mere existence within us of an unchallengeable idea, an immediate
faith in what is presented: it presupposes questioning, doubt, a break
with the immediate, and is the correction of any possible error. Any
rationalism admits of at least one absurdity, that of having to be formulated as a thesis. Any philosophy of the absurd recognizes some meaning at least in the aﬃrmation of absurdity. I can remain in the realm of
the absurd only if I suspend all aﬃrmation, if, like Montaigne or the
schizophrenic, I conﬁne myself within an interrogation which I must
not even formulate: for by formulating it I should ask a question
which, like any determinate question, would entail a reply. If, in short,
I face truth not with its negation, but with a state of non-truth or
ambiguity, the actual opacity of my existence. In the same way, I can
remain within the sphere of absolute self-evidence only if I refuse to
make any aﬃrmation, or to take anything for granted, if, as Husserl has
it, I stand in wonder before the world,81 and ceasing to be in league
with it, I bring to light the ﬂow of motivations which bear me along in
it, making my life wholly aware of itself, and explicit. When I try to
pass from this interrogative state to an aﬃrmation, and a fortiori when I
81

try to express myself, I crystallize an indeﬁnite collection of motives
within an act of consciousness, I revert to the implicit, that is, to the
equivocal and to the world’s free play.82 My absolute contact with
myself, the identity of being an appearance cannot be posited, but only
lived as anterior to any aﬃrmation. In both cases, therefore, we have
the same silence and the same void. The experience of absurdity and
that of absolute self-evidence are mutually implicatory, and even indistinguishable. The world appears absurd, only if a demand for absolute
consciousness ceaselessly dissociates from each other the meanings
with which it swarms, and conversely this demand is motivated by the
conﬂict between those meanings. Absolute self-evidence and the
absurd are equivalent, not merely as philosophical aﬃrmations, but
also as experiences. Rationalism and scepticism draw their sustenance
from an actual life of consciousness which they both hypocritically
take for granted, without which they can be neither conceived nor even
experienced, and in which it is impossible to say that everything has a
signiﬁcance, or that everything is nonsense, but only that there is signiﬁcance. As
Pascal says, doctrines have only to be pressed a little to abound with
contradictions, and yet they give a ﬁrst impression of clarity, and have
an initial signiﬁcance. A truth seen against a background of absurdity,
and an absurdity which the teleology of consciousness presumes to be
able to convert into truth, such is the primary phenomenon. To say
that, in consciousness, appearance and reality are one, or that they are
separate, is to rule out consciousness of anything whatsoever, even as
appearance. Now—such is the true cogito—there is consciousness of
something, something shows itself, there is such a thing as a phenomenon. Consciousness is neither the positing of oneself, nor ignorance
of oneself, it is not concealed from itself, which means that there is nothing in it which does not in some way announce itself to it, although it
does not need to know this explicitly. In consciousness, appearance is
not being, but the phenomenon. This new cogito, because it is anterior
to revealed truth and error, makes both possible. The lived is certainly
lived by me, nor am I ignorant of the feelings which I repress, and in
this sense there is no unconscious. But I can experience more things
than I represent to myself, and my being is not reducible to what
82

The problem of expression is referred to by Fink, op. cit., p. 382.

345

346 phenomenology of perception
expressly appears to me concerning myself. That which is merely lived
is ambivalent; there are feelings in me which I do not name, and also
spurious states of well-being to which I am not fully given over. The
diﬀerence between illusion and perception is intrinsic, and the truth of
perception can be read oﬀ only from perception itself. If, on a sunken
path, I think I can see, some distance away, a broad, ﬂat stone on the
ground, which is in reality a patch of sunlight, I cannot say that I ever
see the ﬂat stone in the sense in which I am to see, as I draw nearer, the
patch of sunlight. The ﬂat stone, like all things at a distance, appears
only in a ﬁeld of confused structure in which connections are not yet
clearly articulated. In this sense, the illusion, like the image, is not
observable, which means that my body has no grip on it, and that I
cannot unfold it before me by any exploratory action. And yet, I am
capable of omitting this distinction and of falling into illusion. It is
untrue that, if I conﬁne myself to what I really see, I am never mistaken
and that sensation at least leaves no room for doubt. Every sensation is
already pregnant with a meaning, inserted into a conﬁguration which
is either obscure or clear, and there is no sense-datum which remains
unchanged when I pass from the illusory stone to the real patch of
sunlight. The infallibility of sensation entails that of perception, and
would rule out illusion. I see the illusory stone in the sense that my
whole perceptual and motor ﬁeld endows the bright spot with the
signiﬁcance ‘stone on the path’. And already I prepare to feel under my
foot this smooth, ﬁrm surface. The fact is that correct and illusory
vision are not distinguishable in the way that adequate and inadequate
thought are: as thought, that is, which is respectively consummate and
lacunary. I say that I perceive correctly when my body has a precise
hold on the spectacle, but that does not mean that my hold is ever allembracing; it would be so only if I had succeeded in reducing to a state
of articulate perception all the inner and outer horizons of the object,
which is in principle impossible. In experiencing a perceived truth, I
assume that the concordance so far experienced would hold for a more
detailed observation; I place my conﬁdence in the world. Perceiving is
pinning one’s faith, at a stroke, in a whole future of experiences, and
doing so in a present which never strictly guarantees the future; it is
placing one’s belief in a world. It is this opening upon a world which
makes possible perceptual truth and the actual eﬀecting of a

space

Wahr-Nehmung, thus enabling us to ‘cross out’ the previous illusion and
regard it as null and void. Seeing, some distance away in the margin of
my visual ﬁeld, a large moving shadow, I look in that direction and the
phantasm shrinks and takes up its due place; it was simply a ﬂy near my
eye. I was conscious of seeing a shadow and now I am conscious of having seen nothing
more than a ﬂy. My adherence to the world enables me to allow for the
variations in the cogito, to favour one cogito at the expense of another and
to catch up with the truth of my thinking beyond its appearances. In
the very moment of illusion this possibility of correction was presented to me, because illusion too makes use of this belief in the world
and is dependent upon it while contracting into a solid appearance,
and because in this way, always being open upon a horizon of possible
veriﬁcations, it does not cut me oﬀ from truth. But, for the same
reason, I am not immune from error, since the world which I seek to
achieve through each appearance, and which endows that appearance,
rightly or wrongly, with the weight of truth, never necessarily requires
this particular appearance. There is the absolute certainty of the world
in general, but not of any one thing in particular. Consciousness is
removed from being, and from its own being, and at the same time
united with them, by the thickness of the world. The true cogito is not
the intimate communing of thought with the thought of that thought:
they meet only on passing through the world. The consciousness of the
world is not based on self-consciousness: they are strictly contemporary.
There is a world for me because I am not unaware of myself; and I am
not concealed from myself because I have a world. This pre-conscious
possession of the world remains to be analysed in the pre-reﬂective
cogito.

3
THE THING AND THE
NATURAL WORLD
A thing has ‘characteristics’ or ‘properties’ which are stable, even if
they do not entirely serve to deﬁne it, and we propose to approach the
phenomenon of reality by studying perceptual constants. A thing has in
the ﬁrst place its size and its shape throughout variations of perspective
which are merely apparent. We do not attribute these appearances to
the object itself, but regard them as an accidental feature of our relations with it, and not as being of it. What do we mean by this, and on
what basis do we judge that form or size are the form and size of the
object?
What is presented to us in the case of each object, the psychologist
will assert, are sizes and shapes which always vary with the perspective,
and it is conventional to regard as true the size which the object has
when within reach, or the shape which it assumes when it is in a plane
parallel to the frontal elevation. These are no truer than any other, but
since this distance and this aspect are both typical, and evolved with the
help of our body, which is an ever-present guide for this purpose, we
can always recognize them, and so they themselves provide us with a
standard for ﬁxing and distinguishing between ﬂeeting appearances;
for constructing objectivity, in short. The square viewed obliquely, as
something roughly diamond-shaped, is distinguished from a real

the thing and the natural world

diamond shape only if we keep the orientation in mind, if, for
example, we settle on the frontal aspect as the crucial appearance,
and relate any given appearance to what it would become in this
context. But this psychological reconstitution of objective size or
shape takes for granted what has to be explained, namely a gamut of
determinate sizes and shapes from which it is suﬃcient to select one as
the real size or shape. We have already stated that in respect of one
and the same retreating or revolving object I do not have a set of
‘mental images’ which progressively diminish in size, or become
more and more distorted, and between which I make a conventional
choice. In so far as I account for my perception in these terms, to
that extent I am already introducing the world with its objective
shapes and sizes. The question is not only how one size or shape,
among all apparent sizes or shapes is regarded as an invariant: it is a
much more searching one. It is a matter of understanding how a
determinate shape or size—true or even apparent—can come to
light before me, become crystallized in the ﬂux of my experience
and, in short, be given to me. Or, more concisely still, how can
there be objectivity?
There would seem, at least at ﬁrst glance, to be a way of evading the
question, namely by conceding that it is in fact never the case that size
and shape are perceived as attributes of a single object, and that they are
simply names for the relations between the parts of the phenomenal
ﬁeld. In this case the constancy of the real size or shape which is
maintained through the varying perspectives is merely the constancy in
the relations between the phenomenon and the conditions accompanying its presentation. For example, the true size of my fountain-pen is
not, as it were, a quality inherent in any of my perceptions of the pen; it
is not given or noted in a perception, like red, warmth or sweetness.
The fact that it remains constant is not explained by my remembering
any former experience in which I observed it. It is the invariant, or
the law governing the variations of the visual appearance in relation to
the apparent distance. Reality is not a crucial appearance underlying the
rest, it is the framework of relations with which all appearances tally. If
I hold my pen near my eyes so that it shuts out almost the whole scene
before me, its real size remains small, because the pen which hides
everything is also a pen seen at close quarters, and because this condition,

349

350 phenomenology of perception
which is always conveyed to me in my perception, reduces the appearance once more to modest proportions. The square which is presented
to me obliquely remains a square, not because this apparent diamond
shape brings to mind the familiar form of the square seen directly in
front of me, but because the diamond-shaped appearance in an oblique
presentation is immediately identical to the square appearance in a
frontal presentation, because, along with each of these conﬁgurations, I
am given that orientation of the object which makes it possible, and
because these shapes are presented in a context of relations which, a
priori, equate the various perspective presentations with each other. The
cube with its sides distorted by perspective nevertheless remains a
cube, not because I imagine the successive aspects of the six faces if I
turned the cube round in my hand, but because the perspective distortions are not raw data, any more than is the perfectly symmetrical shape
which faces me. Each element of the cube, if we unfold from it all the
perceived signiﬁcance, acquaints us with the present point of view
taken of it by the observer. A merely apparent shape or size is one with
as yet no place in the tightly knit system formed by phenomena and my
body together. As soon as it ﬁnds its place in that system, it ﬁnds its
truth, and perspective distortion is no longer passively endured, but
understood. The appearance is misleading and in the literal sense an
appearance only when it is indeterminate. The question how there
come to be true shapes or sizes, or objective or real ones, amounts to
asking how there are, for us, determinate shapes. And there are
determinate shapes like ‘a square’ or ‘a diamond shape’, or any actual
spatial conﬁguration, because our body as a point of view upon things,
and things as abstract elements of one single world, form a system in
which each moment is immediately expressive of every other. A certain
way of directing my gaze in relation to the object signiﬁes a certain
appearance of the object and of neighbouring objects. In all its appearances the object retains invariable characteristics, remains itself invariable and is an object because all the possible values in relation to size
and shape which it can assume are bound up in advance in the formula
of its relations with the context. What we are aﬃrming in the speciﬁc
being of the object, is in reality a facies totius universi which remains
unchanged, and in it is grounded the equivalence of all its appearances
and the identity of its being. In following out the logic of objective size

the thing and the natural world

and shape, we should, with Kant, see that it refers to the positing of a
world as a rigorously interrelated system, that we are never enclosed
within appearance, and that, in short, the object alone is able fully to
appear.
Thus we place ourselves directly within the object, we overlook the
psychologist’s problems, but have we really left them behind? When it
is said that the true size or shape are no more than the constant law
according to which the appearance, the distance and the orientation
vary, it is assumed that they can be treated as variables or measurable
sizes, and therefore that they are already determinate, when what we
are concerned with is precisely how they become so. Kant is right in
saying that perception is, by its nature, polarized towards the object.
But what is incomprehensible in his account is appearance as appearance. Since the perspective views of the object are directly and immediately set into the objective system of the world, the subject thinks
rather than perceives his perception and its truth. Perceptual
consciousness does not give us perception as a body of organized
knowledge, or the size and shape of the object as laws; the numerical
speciﬁcations of science retrace the outline of a constitution of the
world which is already realized before shape and size come into being.
Like the scientist, Kant takes the results of this pre-scientiﬁc experience
for granted, and is enabled to ignore them only because he makes use
of them. When I contemplate before me the furniture in my room, the
table with its shape and size is for me not a law or rule governing the
parade of phenomena, and an invariable relationship: it is because I
perceive the table with its deﬁnite shape and size that I presume, for
every change of distance or orientation, a corresponding change of
shape and size, and not the reverse. Far from its being the case that the
thing is reducible to constant relationships, it is in the self-evidence of
the thing that this constancy of relationships has its basis. For science
and objective thought, an apparently small object seen a hundred yards
away is indistinguishable from the same object seen ten yards away at a
greater angle, and the object is nothing but the constant product of the
distance multiplied by the apparent size. But for me the perceiver, the
object a hundred yards away is not real and present in the sense in
which it is at ten yards, and I identify the object in all its positions, at all
distances, in all appearances, in so far as all the perspectives converge

351

352 phenomenology of perception
towards the perception which I obtain at a certain distance and with a
certain typical orientation. This privileged perception ensures the unity
of the perceptual process and draws into it all other appearances. For
each object, as for each picture in an art gallery, there is an optimum
distance from which it requires to be seen, a direction viewed from
which it vouchsafes most of itself: at a shorter or greater distance we
have merely a perception blurred through excess or deﬁciency. We
therefore tend towards the maximum of visibility, and seek a better
focus as with a microscope.1 This is obtained through a certain balance
between the inner and outer horizon: a living body, seen at too close
quarters, and divorced from any background against which it can stand
out, is no longer a living body, but a mass of matter as outlandish as a
lunar landscape, as can be appreciated by inspecting a segment of skin
through a magnifying glass. Again, seen from too great a distance, the
body loses its living value, and is seen simply as a puppet or automation. The living body itself appears when its microstructure is neither
excessively nor insuﬃciently visible, and this moment equally determines its real size and shape. The distance from me to the object is not
a size which increases or decreases, but a tension which ﬂuctuates
round a norm. An oblique position of the object in relation to me is not
measured by the angle which it forms with the plane of my face, but
felt as a lack of balance, as an unequal distribution of its inﬂuences
upon me. The variations in appearance are not so many increases or
decreases in size, or real distortions. It is simply that sometimes the
parts mingle and become confused, at others they link up into a clearly
articulated whole, and reveal their wealth of detail. There is one culminating point of my perception which simultaneously satisﬁes these
three norms, and towards which the whole perceptual process tends. If
I draw the object closer to me or turn it round in my ﬁngers in order
‘to see it better’, this is because each attitude of my body is for me,
immediately, the power of achieving a certain spectacle, and because
each spectacle is what it is for me in a certain kinaesthetic situation. In
other words, because my body is permanently stationed before things
in order to perceive them and, conversely, appearances are always
enveloped for me in a certain bodily attitude. In so far, therefore, as I
1

Schapp, Beiträge zur Phänomenologie der Wahrnehmung, pp. 59 and ﬀ.

the thing and the natural world

know the relation of appearances to the kinaesthetic situation, this is
not in virtue of any law or in terms of any formula, but to the extent
that I have a body, and that through that body I am at grips with the
world. And just as perceptual attitudes are not known to me singly, but
implicitly given as stages in the act which leads to the optimum attitude, correspondingly the correlative perspectives are not posited
before me successively, but present themselves only as so many steps
towards the thing itself with its size and shape. Kant saw clearly that the
problem is not how determinate shapes and sizes make their appearance in my experience, since without them there would be no experience, and since any internal experience is possible only against the
background of external experience. But Kant’s conclusion from
this was that I am a consciousness which embraces and constitutes the
world, and this reﬂective action caused him to overlook the
phenomenon of the body and that of the thing.
The fact is that if we want to describe it, we must say that my
experience breaks forth into things and transcends itself in them,
because it always comes into being within the framework of a certain
setting in relation to the world which is the deﬁnition of my body.
Sizes and shapes merely provide a modality for this comprehensive
hold on the world. The thing is big if my gaze cannot fully take it in,
small if it does so easily, and intermediate sizes are distinguishable
according as, when placed at an equal distance from me, they cause a
smaller or greater dilation of my eye, or an equal dilation at diﬀerent
distances. The object is circular if, all its sides being equally near to me,
it imposes no deviation upon the regular curvature of my gaze, or if
those deviations which are imposed are attributable to the oblique
presentation, according to the knowledge of the world which is given
to me with my body.2 It is, therefore, quite true that any perception of a
2

The constancy of forms and sizes in perception is therefore not an intellectual function,
but an existential one, which means that it has to be related to the prelogical act by which
the subject takes up his place in the world. When a human subject is placed at the centre
of a sphere on which discs of equal diameter are ﬁxed, it is noticed that constancy is
much more perfect in the horizontal than in the vertical plane. The huge moon on the
horizon contrasted with the very small one at the zenith is merely a particular case of the
same law. For apes, on the other hand, vertical movement in trees is an natural as is
horizontal movement on the ground for us, with the result that vertical constancy is
faultless. Koﬀka, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, pp. 94 and ﬀ.

354 phenomenology of perception
thing, a shape or a size as real, any perceptual constancy refers back to
the positing of a world and of a system of experience in which my
body is inescapably linked with phenomena. But the system of experience is not arrayed before me as if I were God, it is lived by me from a
certain point of view; I am not the spectator, I am involved, and it is my
involvement in a point of view which makes possible both the ﬁniteness of my perception and its opening out upon the complete world as
a horizon of every perception. In so far as I know that a tree on the
horizon remains what it is for closer perception, and retains its real
shape and size, it is simply that this horizon is the horizon of my
immediate environment, and that the gradual perceptual possession of
the things which it contains is guaranteed to me. In other words,
perceptual experiences hang together, are mutually motivating and
implicatory; the perception of the world is simply an expansion of my
ﬁeld of presence without any outrunning of the latter’s essential structures, and the body remains in it but at no time becomes an object in it.
The world is an open and indeﬁnite unity in which I have my place, as
Kant shows in the Transcendental Dialectic, but as he seems to forget in
the Analytic.
The qualities of the thing, its colour for example, or its hardness or
weight, teach us much more about it than its geometrical properties.
The table is, and remains, brown throughout the varied play of natural
or artiﬁcial lighting. Now what, to begin with, is this real colour, and
how have we access to it? We shall be tempted to reply that it is the
colour which I most often see as belonging to the table, the one which
it assumes in daylight, a short distance away, under ‘normal’ conditions, which means those which occur most frequently. When the
distance is too great or when the light has a colour of its own, as at
sunset or under electric lighting, I substitute for the actual colour a
remembered one,3 which predominates because it is imprinted within
me by numerous experiences. In this case the constancy of colour is a
real constancy. But we have here no more than an artiﬁcial reconstruction of the phenomenon. For, with regard to perception itself, it cannot
be said that the brown of the table presents itself in all kinds of light as
the same brown, the same quality actually given by memory. A piece of
3

white paper seen in shadow and recognized for what it is, is not purely
and simply white, it ‘does not allow itself to be placed satisfactorily in
the white-black series’.4 Given a white wall in the shade and a grey
piece of paper in the light, it cannot be said that the wall remains white
and the paper grey; the paper makes a greater impact on the eye,5 it is
lighter and clearer, whereas the wall is darker and duller, and what
remains beneath the variations of lighting is, so to speak, only the
‘substance of the colour’.6 The alleged constancy of colours does not
prevent ‘an indubitable modiﬁcation during which we continue to
receive in our vision the fundamental quality and, so to speak, that
which is substantial in it’.7 This same reason will prevent us from
treating the constancy of colours as an ideal constancy attributable to
the judgement. For a judgement capable of distinguishing within a
given appearance that element which is to be accounted for by the
particular lighting must lead ultimately to an identiﬁcation of the
object’s own true colour, and we have seen that this does not in fact
remain identical. The weakness of both empiricism and intellectualism
lies in their refusing to recognize any colours other than those ﬁxed
qualities which make their appearance in a reﬂective attitude, whereas
colour in living perception is a way into the thing. We must rid ourselves of the illusion, encouraged by physics, that the perceived world
is made up of colour qualities. As painters have observed, there are few
colours in nature. The perception of colours is developed late in children, and in any case follows upon the constitution of a world. The
Maoris have 3,000 names of colours, not because they perceive a great
many, but, on the contrary, because they fail to identify them when
they belong to objects structurally diﬀerent from each other.8 As
Scheler puts it, perception goes straight to the thing and by-passes the
colour, just as it is able to fasten upon the expression of a gaze without
noting the colour of the eyes. We shall not succeed in understanding
perception unless we take into account a colour function which may
remain even when the qualitative appearance is modiﬁed. I say that my

fountain-pen is black, and I see it as black under the sun’s rays. But this
blackness is less the sensible quality of blackness than a sombre power
which radiates from the object, even when it is overlaid with reﬂected
light, and it is visible only in the sense in which moral blackness is
visible. The real colour persists beneath appearances as the background
persists beneath the ﬁgure, that is, not as a seen or thought-of quality,
but through a non-sensory presence. Physics and also psychology give
an arbitrary deﬁnition of colour, which in reality ﬁts only one of its
modes of appearance and has for long obscured the rest. Hering
requires that in the study and comparison of colours we concern ourselves with only the pure colour, leaving aside all external circumstances. We must work ‘not on the colours which belong to a
determinate object, but on a quale, whether plane or pervading the
whole of space, which subsists for itself with no determinate vehicle’.9
The colours of the spectrum roughly fulﬁl these conditions. But these
coloured areas (Flächenfarben) are in reality only one of the possible
structures of colour, and already the colour of a piece of paper or a
surface colour (Oberﬂächenfarbe) no longer obeys the same laws. The
diﬀerential thresholds are lower in the case of surface colours than in
coloured areas.10 Coloured areas are indeed located at a distance,
though vaguely; they have a spongy appearance, whereas surface colours are dense and hold the gaze upon their surface. Coloured areas,
moreover, are always parallel to the frontal plane, whereas surface
colours may show any orientation. Finally coloured areas are always
more or less ﬂat, and cannot, without losing their distinctive quality as
such, assume a particular form and appear curved or spread out over a
surface.11 Yet both these modes of appearance are to be found in psychologists’ experiments, where, moreover, they are often confused.
But there are many others about which psychologists have for long
remained silent: the colour of transparent bodies, which occupies the
three dimensions of space (Raumfarbe); gloss (Glanz); glow (Glühen);
brightness (Leuchten) and generally the colour of lighting, which is so
far from running into that of the source of light that the painter can

represent the former by the distribution of light and shade on objects
and omit the latter altogether.12 We are predisposed to believe that we
have here diﬀerent arrangements of a perception of colour which is in
itself invariable, diﬀerent forms conferred upon one and the same
sensible material. In fact, we have diﬀerent colour-functions in which
the alleged material disappears completely, since the act of patterning
is eﬀected through a change in the sensible properties themselves. It is
particularly true that the distinction between the lighting and the
object’s own colour is not the outcome of any intellectual analysis, or
the conferment of notional meanings on a sensible material, but a
certain organization of colour itself, the arrival at a structure lightingthing lighted, which we need to describe in greater detail, if we are to
understand the constancy of a thing’s ‘own’ colour.13
In gaslight a blue paper looks blue. And yet if we look at it with the
photometer we are surprised to see that it sends the same mixture of
rays to the eye as does a brown paper in daylight.14 A feebly lighted
white wall which, with the reservations already stated, appears white to
the unhampered vision, appears a bluish-grey if we look at it through
the window of a screen which hides the source of light. The painter
achieves the same result without a screen and manages to see colours as
they are determined by the quantity and quality of reﬂected light,
provided that he isolates them from their surrounding, by half-closing
his eyes, for example. This changed appearance is inseparable from a
change of structure in the colour: by the act of interposing the screen

sees it as a line of force running through the visual ﬁeld, and that is why the shadow
behind objects and corresponding to it is immediately set in a living relation to it: the
child says that the shadow ‘is running away from the light’. J. Piaget, La Causalité physique

Indeed it has been shown (Gelb and Goldstein, Psychologische Analysen Hirnpathologischer
Fälle, Über den Wegfall der Wahrnehmung von Oberﬂächenfarben) that constancy of colours may be
found in subjects who have lost the power to receive either surface colour or lighting. It
would appear that constancy is a much more rudimentary phenomenon. It is met with in
animals with varieties of sensory apparatus simpler than the eye. The structure lightingobject lighted is, therefore, a special and highly organized type of constance. But it
remains necessary for a precise and objective constancy, and for a perception of things.

between our eye and the spectacle, and half-closing our eyes, we free
the colours from the objectivity they acquire on the surfaces of bodies
and restore to them the simple state of areas of light. We no longer see
real bodies, such as the wall or the paper, with a determinate colour
and having their place in the world, but coloured patches which are all
situated on one and the same ‘ﬁctional’ plane.15 How precisely does the
screen work? We shall understand this better if we observe the same
phenomenon under diﬀerent conditions. If we look successively
through the eye-holes of two large boxes painted respectively black and
white on the inside, and one illuminated faintly, the other powerfully,
so that the quantity of light received by the eye in each case is the same,
and if we contrive that inside the boxes there shall be no shadow or
lack of uniformity in the painting, they then become indistinguishable,
and in each case we see only an empty space permeated by grey. The
whole eﬀect is altered if a piece of white paper is placed in the black
box, or a piece of black paper in the white one. Immediately the former
appears as black and strongly illuminated, the latter as white and faintly
lit. Hence, for the structure lighting-object lighted to be presented, at
least two surfaces of diﬀerent reﬂecting power are needed.16 If we so
arrange it that the beam of an arc lamp falls exactly upon a black disc,
and if the latter is set in motion to eliminate the inﬂuence of the
roughness which is always present on its surface—the disc appears, like
the rest of the room, faintly lighted, and the beam of light is a whitish
solid with the disc as its base. If we then place a piece of white paper in
front of the disc, ‘immediately we see the disc “black”, the paper
“white”, and both under a strong light.’17 The transformation is so
complete that one has the impression of seeing a fresh disc. These
experiments in which the screen plays no part elucidate those in which
it does: the decisive factor in the phenomenon of constancy, which the
screen eliminates, and which may operate in free vision, is the articulation of the totality of the ﬁeld, the wealth and subtlety of its structures.
When he looks through the window of a screen, the subject can no
longer ‘dominate’ (überschauen) the relationships introduced by lighting,

perceive, that is, in visible space, subordinated wholes, each with its
own distinctness, standing out one against the background of
another.18 When the painter half-closes his eyes, he does away with the
ﬁeld’s organization in depth and with it, the precise contrasts of lighting, so that there are no longer any determinate things with their own
colours. If the experiment with the white paper in the shadow and the
grey paper illuminated is repeated, and if the negative after-images of
the two perceptions are projected on to a screen, it is observed that the
phenomenon of constancy is not preserved, as if constancy and the
structure lighting-lighted object could occur only in things and not in
the diﬀuse space of after-images.19 By admitting that these structures
depend on the organization of the ﬁeld we immediately arrive at an
understanding of all the empirical laws governing the phenomenon of
constancy.20 Firstly, that it is proportional to the size of the retinal area
on to which the spectacle is thrown, and the more pronounced in
proportion as, in the relevant retinal space, a more extensive and more
richly articulated fragment of the world is projected. That it is less
perfect in peripheral than in central vision, in monocular than in binocular vision, in brief than in prolonged vision; that it is attenuated at a
great distance; that it varies with individuals according to the richness
of their perceptual world, and ﬁnally that it is less perfect in coloured
lighting, which cancels out the superﬁcial structure of objects, and
brings the reﬂecting potentialities of diﬀerent surfaces to a common
level, than in colourless lighting which leaves these structural diﬀerences intact.21 The connection between the phenomenon of constancy,
the articulation of the ﬁeld and the phenomenon of lighting can
therefore be regarded as an established fact.
But this functional relation has so far failed to make clear either the
terms which it links, or consequently their concrete connection, and
the greatest beneﬁt of the discovery would be lost if we were content
merely to establish a correlative variation between the three terms
taken in their ordinary sense. In what sense are we to say that the colour of

the object remains constant? What is the organization of the spectacle
and the ﬁeld in which it is organized? What ﬁnally is lighting? Psychological induction remains blind as long as we fail to draw together in
one single phenomenon the three variables which it connotes, and as
long as it does not lead us by the hand to some intuition in which the
alleged ‘causes’ or ‘conditions’ of the phenomenon of constancy shall
appear as ‘moments’ of that phenomenon and in an essential relation
to it.22 Let us then consider the phenomena which have just been
revealed to us, and try to see how they motivate each other in total
perception. Let us look ﬁrst at that peculiar mode of the appearance of
light or of colours which we call lighting. What is peculiar about it?
What occurs when a certain patch of light is taken as lighting instead of
in its own right? Only after centuries of painting did artists perceive
that reﬂection on the eye without which the eye remains dull and
sightless as in the paintings of the early masters.23 The reﬂection is not
seen as such, since it was in fact able to remain unnoticed for so long,
and yet it has its function in perception, since its mere absence deprives
objects and faces of all life and expression. The reﬂection is seen only
incidentally. It is not presented to our perception as an objective, but as
an auxiliary or mediating element. It is not seen itself, but causes us to
see the rest. Reﬂections and lighting in photography are often badly
reproduced because they are transformed into things, and if, in a ﬁlm
for example, a person goes into a cellar holding a lamp, we do not see
the beam of light as an immaterial entity exploring the darkness and
picking out objects, because it becomes solidiﬁed and can no longer
display to us the object at its far end. Light moving over a wall produces
22

In fact the psychologist, however positivistic he tries to remain, certainly feels himself
that the whole value of inductive research is to lead us to a view of phenomena, and he
never quite resists the temptation to hint, at least, at this new coming to awareness. Thus
P. Guillaume (Traité de Psychologie, p. 175), when setting forth the laws governing the
constancy of colours, writes that the eye ‘takes the lighting into account’. Our researches
merely, in a sense, amplify this concise statement. It means nothing in the context of a
strictly positive approach. The eye is not the mind, but a material organ. How could it
ever take anything ‘into account’? It can do so only if we introduce the phenomenal body
beside the objective one, if we make a knowing-body of it, and if, in short, we substitute
for consciousness, as the subject of perception, existence, or being in the world through
a body.

only pools of dazzling brightness which are localized not on the wall,
but on the surface of the screen. Lighting and reﬂection, then, play
their part only if they remain in the background as discreet intermediaries, and lead our gaze instead of arresting it.24 But what are we to
understand by that? When I am led through a strange apartment
towards its owner, there is someone who knows on my behalf, for
whom the unfolding of the visual spectacle has a meaning, and who
moves towards a goal, and I entrust or lend myself to this knowledge
which I do not possess. When some detail in a landscape, which I have
been unable to distinguish alone, is pointed out to me, there is someone who has already seen it, who already knows where to stand and
where to look in order to see it. The lighting directs my gaze and causes
me to see the object, so that in a sense it knows and sees the object. If I
imagine a theatre with no audience in which the curtain rises upon
illuminated scenery, I have the impression that the spectacle is in itself
visible or ready to be seen, and that the light which probes the back and
foreground, accentuating the shadows and permeating the scene
through and through, in a way anticipates our vision. Conversely our
own vision merely takes up on its own account and carries through the
encompassing of the scene by those paths traced out for it by the
lighting, just as, when we hear a sentence, we are surprised to discover
the track of an alien thought. We perceive in conformity with the light,
as we think in conformity with other people in verbal communication.
And just as communication pre-supposes (even while outstripping and
enriching it in the case of new and authentic expression) a certain
linguistic setting through which a meaning resides in the words, so
perception presupposes in us an apparatus capable of responding to the
promptings of light in accordance with their sense* (that is, in accordance both with their direction and their signiﬁcance, which amount to
one thing), of concentrating diﬀuse visibility and completing what is
merely foreshadowed in the spectacle. This apparatus is the gaze, in
other words the natural correlation between appearances and our

kinaesthetic unfoldings, something not known through a law, but
experienced as the involvement of our body in the typical structures of
a world. Lighting and the constancy of the thing illuminated, which is
its correlative, are directly dependent on our bodily situation. If, in a
brightly lit room, we observe a white disc placed in a shady corner, the
constancy of the white is imperfect. It improves when we approach the
shady zone containing the disc. It becomes perfect when we actually
enter it.25 The shade does not become really a shade (and correspondingly the disc does not count as white) until it has ceased to be in front
of us as something to be seen, but surrounds us, becoming our
environment in which we establish ourselves. This phenomenon
becomes comprehensible only if the spectacle, far from being a collection of objects, a mosaic of qualities arrayed before an acosmic subject,
steals round the subject and oﬀers to come to terms with him. The
lighting is not on the side of the object, it is what we assume, what we
take as the norm, whereas the object lighted stands out before us and
confronts us. The lighting is neither colour nor, in itself, even light, it is
anterior to the distinction between colours and luminosities. This is
why it always tends to become ‘neutral’ for us. The penumbra in which
we are becomes so natural that it is no longer even perceived as penumbra. Electric lighting, which appears yellow immediately upon leaving the daylight, soon ceases to have any deﬁnite colour for us, and, if
some remnant of daylight ﬁnds its way into the room it is this ‘objectively neutral’ light which seems to have a blue tint about it.26 We must
not say that, since the yellow electric lighting is perceived as yellow, we
take account of it in the appreciation of appearances and thus theoretically discover the actual colour of objects. Nor must we say that as the
yellow light becomes all-embracing it is seen as daylight, and that in
this way the colour of other objects remains really constant. We must
say that the yellow light, in assuming the function of lighting, tends to
become anterior to any colour, tends towards absence of colour, and
that correspondingly objects distribute the colours of the spectrum
among themselves according to the degree and mode of their

the thing and the natural world

resistance to this new atmosphere. Every colour as a quale is therefore
mediated by a colour-function, and becomes determinate in relation to
a level which is variable. The level is laid down, and with it all the
colour values dependent upon it, as soon as we begin to live in the
prevailing atmosphere and re-allot to objects the colours of the spectrum in accordance with the requirements of this basic convention.
Taking up our abode in a certain setting of colour, with the transposition which it entails, is a bodily operation, and I cannot eﬀect it
otherwise than by entering into the new atmosphere, because my body is
my general power of inhabiting all the environments which the world
contains, the key to all those transpositions and equivalences which
keep it constant. Thus lighting is merely one element of a complex
structure, the others being the organization of the ﬁeld as our body
contrives it and the thing illuminated in its constancy. The functional
correlations which can be discovered between these three phenomena
are merely manifestations of their ‘essential co-existence’.27
This can be brought out more clearly by scrutinizing the two latter.
What are we to understand by the organization of the ﬁeld? We have
seen that, if we insert a white paper into the beam of light thrown by
an arc lamp, the beam having hitherto been fused with the disc on to
which it falls, and perceived as a solid cone—immediately the beam
and the disc are dissociated and the lighting takes on the quality of
lighting. The introduction of the paper into the beam, by forcing us
clearly to recognize the ‘non-solidity’ of the cone of light, alters its
signiﬁcance in relation to the disc supporting it and brings out its
quality as lighting. It is as if there were an incompatibility, vividly
experienced, between the sight of the illuminated paper and that of a
solid cone, and as if the signiﬁcance of part of the spectacle induced a
reassessment of the signiﬁcance of the whole. In the same way we
have seen that in the various parts of the visual ﬁeld taken separately, the
distinctive colour of the object on the one hand and the lighting on the
other are indistinguishable, but that, in the visual ﬁeld taken as a whole
and through a kind of reciprocal action in which each part beneﬁts
from the conﬁguration of the rest, a general eﬀect of lighting emerges
and endows each local colour with its ‘true’ value. Here again, it is as if
27

Wesenskoexistenz, Gelb, Farbenkonstanz, p. 671.

363

364 phenomenology of perception
the parts of the spectacle, being unable singly to summon up the vision
of lighting, made this possible by their union, and also as if, into the
colour values spread through the ﬁeld, someone read the possibility of
a systematic transformation. When a painter wants to depict some
striking object, he does so less by applying a bright colour to that
object than by a suitable distribution of light and shade on surrounding
ones.28 If we manage momentarily to glimpse a hollowed motif as one
in relief, a seal for example, we suddenly have the impression of a
magic lighting emanating from the interior of the object. This is
because the light and shade relationships on the seal are then the
opposite of what they should be by reason of the lighting at the time. If
we move a lamp round a bust at a constant distance from it, even when
the lamp itself is invisible we see the rotation of the source of light in
the complex of changing light and colour which is all that is given.29
There is, then, a ‘logic of lighting’30 or again a ‘synthesis of lighting’,31 a compossibility of the parts of the visual ﬁeld, which may well
be speciﬁed in disjunctive propositions, as when the painter tries to
justify his work to an art critic, but which is primarily experienced as
the consistency of the picture or the reality of the spectacle. What is
more, there is a total logic of the picture or the spectacle, a felt coherence of the colours, spatial forms and signiﬁcance of the object. A
picture in an art gallery, when seen at an appropriate distance, has its
internal lighting which confers upon each patch of colours not only its
colour value, but also a certain representative value. Seen at too close
quarters it falls under the prevailing lighting of the art gallery, and the
colours ‘then no longer act in a representative manner, and no longer
present us with the image of certain objects, but act as so much daubing on a canvas’.32 If, on looking at a mountain scene, we adopt a
critical attitude and isolate part of the ﬁeld, then the colour itself
changes, and this green, which was meadow green, when taken out of
its context, loses its thickness and its colour as well as its representative

value.33 A colour is never merely a colour, but the colour of a certain
object, and the blue of a carpet would never be the same blue were it
not a woolly blue. The colours of the visual ﬁeld, as we earlier saw,
form an ordered system round a dominant which is the lighting taken
as a level. We now begin to see a deeper meaning in the organization of
a ﬁeld: it is not only colours, but also geometrical forms, all sense-data
and the signiﬁcance of objects which go to form a system. Our perception in its entirety is animated by a logic which assigns to each object
its determinate features in virtue of those of the rest, and which ‘cancel
out’ as unreal all stray data; it is entirely sustained by the certainty of
the world. In this way we ﬁnally see the true signiﬁcance of perceptual
constancies. The constancy of colour is only an abstract component of
the constancy of things, which in turn is grounded in the primordial
constancy of the world as the horizon of all our experiences. It is not,
then, because I perceive constant colours beneath the variety of lightings that I believe in the existence of things, nor is the thing a collection of constant characteristics. It is, on the contrary, in so far as my
perception is in itself open upon a world and on things that I discover
constant colours.
The phenomenon of constancy is a general one. It has been found
possible to speak of a constancy of sounds,34 temperatures, weights,35
and indeed data which are in the strict sense tactile, a constancy itself
mediated by certain structures, certain ‘modes of appearance’ of phenomena in each of these sensory ﬁelds. The perception of weights
remains the same whatever the muscles called into play, and whatever
their initial position. When an object is lifted with the eyes closed, its
weight is no diﬀerent, whether or not the hand carries an extra weight
(and whether this weight exerts pressure on the back of the hand or a
pull on the palm)—whether the hand is free or is fastened in such a
way that the ﬁngers work alone—whether one or more ﬁngers perform the task—whether the object be raised with the hand or the head,
foot or teeth—and ﬁnally whether the object is lifted in the air or in

water. Thus the tactile impression is ‘interpreted’ in the light of the
nature and number of the parts of the body brought into play, and even
of the physical circumstances under which it appears; thus do impressions, in themselves highly variable, such as pressure on the skin of the
forehead and on the hand, mediate the same perception of weight. It is
impossible here to suppose that the interpretation rests on any explicit
induction, and that, in the previous experiment, the subject was able to
measure the incidence of these diﬀerent variables on the actual weight
of the object. He has probably never had occasion to interpret frontal
pressure in terms of weight or, in order to ﬁnd the ordinary scale of
weights, to add to the local impression of the ﬁngers the weight of the
arm reduced through immersion in water. Even if it be conceded that,
through the use of his body, the subject has gradually evolved a scale of
weight-equivalences, and learned that a certain impression furnished
through the muscles of the ﬁngers is equivalent to another derived
from the whole hand, such inductions, since they are applied to parts
of the body which have never been used for the lifting of weights, must
at all events be made within the framework of a global bodily knowledge which systematically embraces all its parts. The constancy of
weight is not a real constancy, or the permanence within us of some
‘impression of weight’, gained through those parts of the body most
often used, and reached by association in the remaining cases. Is the
weight of the object, then, to be regarded as a theoretical invariant, and
the perception of weight a judgement by means of which, the impression and the bodily and physical circumstances in which it occurs
being in each case brought into relation with each other, we discern by
a kind of natural physics a constant relationship between these two
variables? But this can be so only in a manner of speaking: we do not
know our body and the power, weight and scope of our organs as an
engineer knows the machine which he has assembled part by part. And
when we compare the work of our hand with that of our ﬁngers, it is
against the background of a comprehensive potentiality of our limb as
hitherto known that they are distinguished or identiﬁed, and in the
unity of an ‘I can’ that the operations of diﬀerent parts of the body
appear equivalent. Correspondingly the ‘impressions’ provided by each
one of them are not really distinct and related to each other merely by
an explicit interpretation, but present themselves immediately as

the thing and the natural world

diﬀerent manifestations of the ‘real’ weight, and the preobjective unity
of the thing is correlative to the pre-objective unity of the body. Thus
the weight appears as the identiﬁable property of a thing against the
background of our body as a system of equivalent gestures. This analysis of the perception of weight elucidates the whole of tactile perception: the movement of one’s own body is to touch what lighting is to
vision.36 All tactile perception, while opening itself to an objective
‘property’, includes a bodily component; the tactile localization of an
object, for example, assigns to it its place in relation to the cardinal
points of the body image. This property which, at ﬁrst sight, draws an
absolute distinction between touch and vision, in fact makes it possible
to draw them together. It is true that the visible object is in front of us
and not on our eye, but we have seen that in the last resort the visible
position, size or shape are determined by the direction, scope and hold
which our gaze has upon them. It is true that passive touch (for
example touch inside the ear or nose, and generally in all parts of the
body ordinarily covered) tells us hardly anything but the state of our
own body and almost nothing about the object. Even on the most
sensitive parts of our tactile surface, pressure without movement produces a scarcely identiﬁable phenomenon.37 But there is also passive
vision, with no gaze speciﬁcally directed, as in the case of a dazzling
light, which does not unfold an objective space before us, and in which
the light ceases to be light and becomes something painful which
invades cur eye itself. And like the exploratory gaze of true vision, the
‘knowing touch’38 projects us outside our body through movement.
When one of my hands touches the other, the hand that moves functions as subject and the other as object.39 There are tactile phenomena,
alleged tactile qualities, like roughness and smoothness, which disappear completely if the exploratory movement is eliminated. Movement
and time are not only an objective condition of knowing touch, but a
phenomenal component of tactile data. They bring about the patterning of tactile phenomena, just as light shows up the conﬁguration of a

visible surface.40 Smoothness is not a collection of similar pressures,
but the way in which a surface utilizes the time occupied by our tactile
exploration or modulates the movement of our hand. The style of these
modulations particularizes so many modes of appearance of the tactile
phenomenon, which are not reducible to each other and cannot be
deduced from an elementary tactile sensation. There are ‘surface tactile
phenomena’ (Oberﬂächentastungen) in which a two-dimensional tactile
object is presented to the touch and more or less ﬁrmly resists penetration, three-dimensional tactile environments, comparable to areas of
colour, for example a ﬂow of air or water which we allow to run over
our hand—and there is also tactile transparency (Durchtastete Flächen).
Dampness, oiliness and stickiness belong to a more complex layer of
structures.41 On touching a piece of carved wood, we immediately
distinguish the grain of the wood, which is its natural structure, from
the artiﬁcial structure which has been conferred upon it by the wood
carver, just as the ear picks out a note from a set of noises.42 There are
here various structures of the exploratory movement, and the corresponding phenomena cannot be treated as a collection of elementary
tactile impressions, since the alleged component impressions are not
even given to the subject: if I touch a piece of linen material or a brush,
between the bristles of the brush and the threads of the linen, there
does not lie a tactile nothingness, but a tactile space devoid of matter, a
tactile background.43 Not being really dissectable, the complex tactile
phenomenon is, for the same reasons, not theoretically so either, and if
we tried to deﬁne hardness or softness, roughness or smoothness, sand
or honey as so many laws or rules governing the development of tactile
experience, it would still be necessary to include in the latter knowledge of the elements which the law co-ordinates. The person who
touches and who recognizes the rough and the smooth does not posit
either their elements or the relations between those elements, nor does
he think of them in any thoroughgoing way. It is not consciousness
which touches or feels, but the hand, and the hand is, as Kant says, ‘an

outer brain of man’.44 In visual experience, which pushes objectiﬁcation further than does tactile experience, we can, at least at ﬁrst sight,
ﬂatter ourselves that we constitute the world, because it presents us
with a spectacle spread out before us at a distance, and gives us the
illusion of being immediately present everywhere and being situated
nowhere. Tactile experience, on the other hand, adheres to the surface
of our body; we cannot unfold it before us, and it never quite becomes
an object. Correspondingly, as the subject of touch, I cannot ﬂatter
myself that I am everywhere and nowhere; I cannot forget in this case
that it is through my body that I go to the world, and tactile experience
occurs ‘ahead’ of me, and is not centred in me. It is not I who touch, it
is my body; when I touch I do not think of diversity, but my hands
rediscover a certain style which is part of their motor potentiality, and
this is what we mean when we speak of a perceptual ﬁeld. I am able to
touch eﬀectively only if the phenomenon ﬁnds an echo within me, if it
accords with a certain nature of my consciousness, and if the organ
which goes out to meet it is synchronized with it. The unity and
identity of the tactile phenomenon do not come about through any
synthesis of recognition in the concept, they are founded upon the
unity and identity of the body as a synergic totality. ‘On the day the
child uses its hand as a unique instrument of prehension, it becomes
equally a unique instrument of touch’.45 Not only do I use my ﬁngers
and my whole body as a single organ, but also, thanks to this unity of
the body, the tactile perceptions gained through an organ are immediately translated into the language of the rest; for example, the contact of
our back or chest with linen or wool remains in the memory in the
form of a manual contact,46 and it may be said in more general terms
that we can, in recollection, touch an object with parts of our body
which have never actually been in contact with it.47 Each contact of an
object with part of our objective body is, therefore, in reality a contact
with the whole of the present or possible phenomenal body. That is
how the constancy of a tactile object may come about through its

various manifestations. It is a constancy-for-my-body, an invariant of
its total behaviour. The body is borne towards tactile experience by all
its surfaces and all its organs simultaneously, and carries with it a
certain typical structure of the tactile ‘world’.
We are now in a position to approach the analysis of the thing as an
inter-sensory entity. The thing as presented to sight (the moon’s pale
disc) or to touch (my skull as I can feel it when I touch it), and which
stays the same for us through a series of experiences, is neither a quale
genuinely subsisting, nor the notion or consciousness of such an
objective property, but what is discovered or taken up by our gaze or
our movement, a question to which these things provide a fully
appropriate reply. The object which presents itself to the gaze or the
touch arouses a certain motor intention which aims not at the movements of one’s own body, but at the thing itself from which they are, as
it were, suspended. And in so far as my hand knows hardness and
softness, and my gaze knows the moon’s light, it is as a certain way of
linking up with the phenomenon and communicating with it. Hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, moonlight and sunlight,
present themselves in our recollection, not pre-eminently as sensory
contents, but as certain kinds of symbiosis, certain ways the outside has
of invading us and certain ways we have of meeting this invasion, and
memory here merely frees the framework of the perception from the
place where it originates. If the constants of each sense are thus understood, the question of deﬁning the inter-sensory thing into which they
unite as a collection of stable attributes or as the notion of this collection, will not arise. The sensory ‘properties’ of a thing together constitute one and the same thing, just as my gaze, my touch and all my other
senses are together the powers of one and the same body integrated into
one and the same action. The surface which I am about to recognize as
the surface of the table, when vaguely looked at, already summons me
to focus upon it, and demands those movements of convergence which
will endow it with its ‘true’ aspect. Similarly any object presented to
one sense calls upon itself the concordant operation of all the others. I
see a surface colour because I have a visual ﬁeld, and because the
arrangement of the ﬁeld leads my gaze to that surface—I perceive a
thing because I have a ﬁeld of existence and because each phenomenon,

the thing and the natural world

on its appearance, attracts towards that ﬁeld the whole of my body as a
system of perceptual powers. I run through appearances and reach the
real colour or the real shape when my experience is at its maximum of
clarity, in spite of the fact that Berkeley may retort that a ﬂy would see
the same object diﬀerently or that a stronger microscope would transform it: these diﬀerent appearances are for me appearances of a certain
true spectacle, that in which the perceived conﬁguration, for a suﬃcient
degree of clarity, reaches its maximum richness.48 I have visual objects
because I have a visual ﬁeld in which richness and clarity are in inverse
proportion to each other, and because these two demands, either of
which taken separately might be carried to inﬁnity, when brought
together, produce a certain culmination and optimum balance in the
perceptual process. In the same way, what I call experience of the thing
or of reality—not merely of a reality-for-sight or for-touch, but of an
absolute reality—is my full co-existence with the phenomenon, at the
moment when it is in every way at its maximum articulation, and the
‘data of the diﬀerent senses’ are directed towards this one pole, as my
‘aims’ as I look through a microscope vacillate about one predominant
‘target’. I do not propose to bestow the term ‘visual thing’ upon a
phenomenon which, like areas of colour, presents no maximum visibility through the various experiences which I have of it, or which, like
the sky, remote and thin on the horizon, unlocalized and diﬀuse at the
zenith, allows itself to be contaminated by the structures closest to it
without setting over against them any conﬁguration of its own. If a
phenomenon—for example, a reﬂection or a light gust of wind—
strikes only one of my senses, it is a mere phantom, and it will come
near to real existence only if, by some chance, it becomes capable of
speaking to my other senses, as does the wind when, for example, it
blows strongly and can be seen in the tumult it causes in the surrounding countryside. Cézanne declared that a picture contains within itself
even the smell of the landscape.49 He meant that the arrangement of
colour on the thing (and in the work of art, if it catches the thing in its
entirety) signiﬁes by itself all the responses which would be elicited
through an examination by the remaining senses; that a thing would

not have this colour had it not also this shape, these tactile properties,
this resonance, this odour, and that the thing is the absolute fullness
which my undivided existence projects before itself. The unity of the
thing beyond all its ﬁxed properties is not a substratum, a vacant X, a
subject in which properties inhere, but that unique accent which is to
be found in each one of them, that unique manner of existing of which
they are a second order expression. For example, the brittleness, hardness, transparency and crystal ring of glass all translate a single manner
of being. If a sick man sees the devil, he sees at the same time his smell,
his ﬂames and smoke, because the signiﬁcant unity ‘devil’ is precisely
that acrid, ﬁre-and-brimstone essence. There is a symbolism in the
thing which links each sensible quality to the rest. Heat enters experience as a kind of vibration of the thing: with colour on the other hand it
is as if the thing is thrust outside itself, and it is a priori necessary that an
extremely hot object should redden, for it is its excess of vibration
which causes it to blaze forth.50 The passing of sensory givens before
our eyes or under our hands is, as it were, a language which teaches
itself, and in which the meaning is secreted by the very structure of
the signs, and this is why it can literally be said that our senses question
things and that things reply to them. ‘The sensible appearance is what
reveals (Kundgibt), and expresses as such what it is not itself ’.51 We
understand the thing as we understand a new kind of behaviour, not,
that is, through any intellectual operation of subsumption, but by taking up on our own account the mode of existence which the observable
signs adumbrate before us. A form of behaviour outlines a certain manner of treating the world. In the same way, in the interaction of things,
each one is characterized by a kind of a priori to which it remains faithful
in all its encounters with the outside world. The signiﬁcance of a thing
inhabits that thing as the soul inhabits the body: it is not behind appearances. The signiﬁcance of the ash-tray (at least its total and individual
50

This unity of the sensory experiences rests on their integration in a single life of which
they thus become the visible witness and emblem. The perceived world is not only a
system of symbols of each sense in terms of the other senses, but also a set of symbols of
human life, as is proved by the ‘ﬂames’ of passion, the ‘light’ of the spirit and so many
other metaphors and myths. H. Conrad-Martius, Realontologie, p. 302.

signiﬁcance, as this is given in perception) is not a certain idea of the
ash-tray which co-ordinates its sensory aspects and is accessible to
the understanding alone, it animates the ash-tray, and is self-evidently
embodied in it. That is why we say that in perception the thing is
given to us ‘in person’, or ‘in the ﬂesh’. Prior to and independently of
other people, the thing achieves that miracle of expression: an inner
reality which reveals itself externally, a signiﬁcance which descends
into the world and begins its existence there, and which can be fully
understood only when the eyes seek it in its own location. Thus the
thing is correlative to my body and, in more general terms, to my
existence, of which my body is merely the stabilized structure. It is
constituted in the hold which my body takes upon it; it is not ﬁrst of
all a meaning for the understanding, but a structure accessible to
inspection by the body, and if we try to describe the real as it appears
to us in perceptual experience, we ﬁnd it overlaid with anthropo
logical predicates.
The relations between things or aspects of things having always our
body as their vehicle, the whole of nature is the setting of our own life,
or our interlocutor in a sort of dialogue. That is why in the last analysis
we cannot conceive anything which is not perceived or perceptible. As
Berkeley says, even an unexplored desert has at least one person to
observe it, namely myself when I think of it, that is, when I perceive it
in purely mental experience. The thing is inseparable from a person
perceiving it, and can never be actually in itself because its articulations
are those of our very existence, and because it stands at the other end of
our gaze or at the terminus of a sensory exploration which invests it
with humanity. To this extent, every perception is a communication or
a communion, the taking up or completion by us of some extraneous
intention or, on the other hand, the complete expression outside ourselves of our perceptual powers and a coition, so to speak, of our body
with things. The fact that this may not have been realized earlier is
explained by the fact that any coming to awareness of the perceptual
world was hampered by the prejudices arising from objective thinking.
The function of the latter is to reduce all phenomena which bear
witness to the union of subject and world, putting in their place the
clear idea of the object as in itself and of the subject as pure consciousness. It therefore severs the links which unite the thing and the

373

374 phenomenology of perception
embodied subject, leaving only sensible qualities to make up our world
(to the exclusion of the modes of appearance which we have
described), and preferably visual qualities, because these give the
impression of being autonomous, and because they are less directly
linked to our body and present us with an object rather than introducing us into an atmosphere. But in reality all things are concretions
of a setting, and any explicit perception of a thing survives in virtue of
a previous communication with a certain atmosphere. We are not ‘a
collection of eyes, ears and organs of touch with their cerebral projections. . . . Just as all literary works . . . are only particular cases of the
possible permutations of the sounds which make up language and of
their literal signs, so qualities or sensations represent the elements from
which the great poetry of our world (Umwelt) is made up. But just as
surely as someone knowing only sounds and letters would have no
understanding of literature, and would miss not only its ultimate
nature but everything about it, so the world is not given and things are
not accessible to those for whom “sensations” are the given.’52 The
perceived is not necessarily an object present before me as a piece of
knowledge to be acquired, it may be a ‘unity of value’ which is present
to me only practically. If a picture has been removed from a living
room, we may perceive that a change has taken place without being
able to say what. I perceive everything that is part of my environment,
and my environment includes ‘everything of which the existence or
non-existence, the nature or modiﬁcation counts in practice for me’;53
the storm which has not yet broken, whose signs I could not even list
and which I cannot even forecast, but for which I am ‘worked up’ and
prepared—the periphery of the visual ﬁeld which the hysterical subject
does not expressly grasp, but which nevertheless co-determines his
movements and orientation—the respect of other men, or that loyal
friendship which I take for granted, but which are none the less there
for me, since they leave me morally speaking in mid-air when I am
deprived of them.54 Love is in the ﬂowers prepared by Félix de Vandenesse for Madame de Mortsauf, just as unmistakeably as in a caress: ‘I

thought that the colours and the foliage had a harmony and a poetry
which emerges into the understanding by delighting the gaze, just as
musical phrases awaken countless memories in hearts that love and are
loved. If colour is organized light, must it not have a meaning, as
diﬀerent combinations of air have theirs . . . Love has its heraldry and
the countess secretly deciphered it. She gave me one of those sharp
looks that seem like the cry of a sick man touched on his wound: she
was both embarrassed and delighted.’ The ﬂowers are self-evidently a
love bouquet, and yet it is impossible to say what in them signiﬁes love,
and that is even the reason why Mme de Mortsauf can accept them
without breaking her vows. There is no way of understanding them
other than by looking at them, but to the beholder they say what they
mean. Their signiﬁcance is the track of an existence, legible and comprehensible for another existence. Natural perception is not a science, it
does not posit the things with which science deals, it does not hold
them at arm’s length in order to observe them, but lives with them; it is
the ‘opinion’ or the ‘primary faith’ which binds us to a world as to our
native land, and the being of what is perceived is the antepredicative
being towards which our whole existence is polarized.
However, we have not exhausted the meaning of ‘the thing’ by
deﬁning it as the correlative of our body and our life. After all, we grasp
the unity of our body only in that of the thing, and it is by taking things
as our starting point that our hands, eyes and all our sense-organs
appear to us as so many interchangeable instruments. The body by
itself, the body at rest is merely an obscure mass, and we perceive it as a
precise and identiﬁable being when it moves towards a thing, and in so
far as it is intentionally projected outwards, and even then this perception is never more than incidental and marginal to consciousness, the
centre of which is occupied with things and the world. One cannot, as
we have said, conceive any perceived thing without someone to perceive it. But the fact remains that the thing presents itself to the person
who perceives it as a thing in itself, and thus poses the problem of a
genuine in-itself-for-us. Ordinarily we do not notice this because our
perception, in the context of our everyday concerns, alights on things
suﬃciently attentively to discover in them their familiar presence, but
not suﬃciently so to disclose the non-human element which lies
hidden in them. But the thing holds itself aloof from us and remains

375

376 phenomenology of perception
self-suﬃcient. This will become clear if we suspend our ordinary preoccupations and pay a metaphysical and disinterested attention to it. It
is then hostile and alien, no longer an interlocutor, but a resolutely
silent Other, a Self which evades us no less than does intimacy with an
outside consciousness. The thing and the world, we have already said,
are oﬀered to perceptual communication as is a familiar face with an
expression which is immediately understood. But then a face expresses
something only through the arrangements of the colours and lights
which make it up, the meaning of the gaze being not behind the eyes,
but in them, and a touch of colour more or less is all the painter needs
in order to transform the facial expression of a portrait. In the work of
his earlier years, Cézanne tried to paint the expression ﬁrst and foremost, and that is why he never caught it. He gradually learned that
expression is the language of the thing itself and springs from its
conﬁguration. His painting is an attempt to recapture the physiognomy
of things and faces by the integral reproduction of their sensible conﬁguration. This is what nature constantly and eﬀortlessly achieves, and
it is why the paintings of Cézanne are ‘those of a pre-world in which as
yet no men existed’.55 The thing appeared to us above as the goal of a
bodily teleology, the norm of our psycho-physiological setting. But
that was merely a psychological deﬁnition which does not make the
full meaning of the thing deﬁned explicit, and which reduces the thing
to those experiences in which we encounter it. We now discover the
core of reality: a thing is a thing because, whatever it imparts to us, is
imparted through the very organization of its sensible aspects. The
‘real’ is that environment in which each moment is not only inseparable from the rest, but in some way synonymous with them, in which
the ‘aspects’ are mutually signiﬁcatory and absolutely equivalent. This
is perfect fulness: it is impossible completely to describe the colour of
the carpet without saying that it is a carpet, made of wool, and without
implying in this colour a certain tactile value, a certain weight and a
certain resistance to sound. The thing is that manner of being for
which the complete deﬁnition of one of its attributes demands that of
the subject in its entirety; an entity, consequently, the signiﬁcance of
which is indistinguishable from its total appearance. Cézanne again
55

F. Novotny, Das Problem des Menschen Cézanne im Verhältnis zu seiner Kunst, p. 275.

the thing and the natural world

said: ‘The outline and the colour are no longer distinct; in proportion
as one paints, one outlines, and the more the colour is harmonized, the
more deﬁnite the outline becomes . . . when the colour is at its richest,
the form is at its most complete’.56 With the structure lighting-lighted,
background and foreground are possible. With the appearance of the
thing, there can at last be univocal forms and positions. The system of
appearances, the prespatial ﬁelds acquire an anchorage and ultimately
become a space. But it is not the case that geometrical features alone are
merged with colour. The very signiﬁcance of the thing is built up
before our eyes, a signiﬁcance which no verbal analysis can exhaust,
and which merges with the exhibiting of the thing in its self-evidence.
Every touch of colour applied by Cézanne must, as E. Bernard says,
‘contain the atmosphere, the light, the object, the relief, the character,
the outline and the style’.57 Each fragment of a visible spectacle satisﬁes
an inﬁnite number of conditions, and it is of the nature of the real to
compress into each of its instants an inﬁnity of relations. Like the thing,
the picture has to be seen and not deﬁned, nevertheless, though it is a
small world which reveals itself within the larger one, it cannot lay
claim to the same substantiality. We feel that it is put together by
design, that in it signiﬁcance precedes existence and clothes itself in
only the minimum of matter necessary for its communication. The
miracle of the real world, on the other hand, is that in it signiﬁcance
and existence are one, and that we see the latter lodge itself in no
uncertain fashion in the former. In the realm of imagination, I have no
sooner formed the intention of seeing than I already believe that I have
seen. The imaginary has no depth, and does not respond to our eﬀorts
to vary our points of view; it does not lend itself to our observation.58
We never have a hold upon it. In every perception, on the other hand, it
is the material itself which assumes signiﬁcance and form. If I wait for
someone at a door in a poorly lit street, each person who comes out
has an indistinct appearance. Someone is coming out, and I do not yet
know whether I can recognize him as the person I am waiting for. The
familiar ﬁgure will emerge from this nebulous background as the earth

does from a ground mist. The real is distinguishable from our ﬁctions
because in reality the signiﬁcance encircles and permeates matter. Once
a picture is torn up, we have in our hands nothing but pieces of daubed
canvas. But if we break up a stone and then further break up the
fragments, the pieces remaining are still pieces of stone. The real lends
itself to unending exploration; it is inexhaustible. This is why objects
belonging to man, tools, seem to be placed on the world, whereas
things are rooted in a background of nature which is alien to man. For
our human existence, the thing is much less a pole which attracts than
one which repels. We do not begin by knowing the perspective aspects
of the thing; it is not mediated by our senses, our sensations or our
perspectives; we go straight to it, and it is only in a secondary way that
we become aware of the limits of our knowledge and of ourselves as
knowing. Here is a die; let us consider it as it is presented, in the natural
attitude, to a subject who has never wondered about perception, and
who lives among things. The die is there, lying in the world. When the
subject moves round it, there appear, not signs, but sides of the die. He
does not perceive projections or even proﬁles of the die, but he sees the
die itself at one time from this side, at another from that, and those
appearances which are not yet ﬁrmly ﬁxed intercommunicate, run into
each other, and all radiate from a central Würfelhaftigkeit59 which is the
mystical link between them.
A set of reductions makes its appearance from the moment we take
the perceiving subject into account. In the ﬁrst place I notice that this
die is for me only. Perhaps after all people nearby do not see it, and this
alone deprives it of some element of its reality; it ceases to be in itself in
order to become the pole of a personal history. Then I observe that the
die is, strictly speaking, presented to me only through sight, and
immediately I am left with nothing but the outer surface of the whole
die; it loses its materiality, empties itself, and is reduced to a visual
structure of form, colour, light and shade. But the form, colour, light
and shade are not in a void, for they still retain a point of support,
namely the visual thing. Furthermore the visual thing has still a spatial
structure which endows its qualitative properties with a particular
value: if I learn that the die is merely an illusory one, its colour changes
59

Scheler, Der Formalismus in der Ethik, p. 52.

the thing and the natural world

straight away, and it no longer has the same manner of modulating
space. All the spatial relations to be found in the die and which are
capable of being made explicit, for example the distance from its nearer
to its farther face, the ‘real’ size of the angles, the ‘real’ direction of its
sides, are indivisible in its being as a visible die. It is by way of a third
reduction that we pass from the visual thing to the perspective aspect: I
observe that the faces of the die cannot all fall beneath my gaze, and
that certain of them undergo distortions. Through a ﬁnal reduction, I
arrive ultimately at the sensation which is no longer a property of the
thing, or even of the perspective aspect, but a modiﬁcation of my
body.60 The experience of the thing does not go through all these
mediations, and consequently the thing is not presented to a mind
which seizes each constituent layer as representative of a higher layer,
building it up from start to ﬁnish. It exists primarily in its selfevidence, and any attempt to deﬁne the thing either as a pole of my
bodily life, or as a permanent possibility of sensations, or as a synthesis
of appearances, puts in place of the thing itself in its primordial being
an imperfect reconstruction of the thing with the aid of bits and pieces
of subjective provenance. How are we to understand both that the
thing is the correlative of my knowing body, and that it rejects that
body?
What is given is not the thing on its own, but the experience of the
thing, or something transcendent standing in the wake of one’s subjectivity, some kind of natural entity of which a glimpse is aﬀorded through
a personal history. If one tried, according to the realistic approach, to
make perception into some coincidence with the thing, it would no
longer be possible to understand what the perceptual event was, how
the subject managed to assimilate the thing, how after coinciding with
the thing he was able to consign it to his own history, since ex hypothesi he
would have nothing of it in his possession. In order to perceive things,
we need to live them. Yet we reject the idealism involved in the synthetic
view, because it too distorts our lived-through relationship to things. In
so far as the perceiving subject synthesizes the percept, he has to dominate and grasp in thought a material of perception, to organize and himself link together, from the inside, all the aspects of the thing, which
60

Scheler, Der Formalismus in der Ethik, pp. 51–4.

379

380 phenomenology of perception
means that perception ceases to be inherent in an individual subject and
a point of view, and that the thing loses its transcendence and opacity. To
‘live’ a thing is not to coincide with it, nor fully to embrace it in thought.
Our problem, therefore, becomes clear. The perceiving subject must,
without relinquishing his place and his point of view, and in the opacity
of sensation, reach out towards things to which he has, in advance, no
key, and for which he nevertheless carries within himself the project,
and open himself to an absolute Other which he is making ready in the
depths of his being. The thing is not all of a piece, for though the
perspective aspects, and the ever-changing ﬂow of appearances, are not
explicitly posited, all are at least ready to be perceived and given in nonpositing consciousness, to precisely the extent necessary for me to be
able to escape from them into the thing. When I perceive a pebble, I am
not expressly conscious of knowing it only through my eyes, of enjoying only certain perspective aspects of it, and yet an analysis in these
terms, if I undertake it, does not surprise me. Beforehand I knew
obscurely that my gaze was the medium and instrument of comprehensive perception, and the pebble appeared to me in the full light of day in
opposition to the concentrated darkness of my bodily organs. I can
imagine possible ﬁssures in the solid mass of the thing if I take it into my
head to close one eye or to think of the perspective. It is in this way that it
is true to say that the thing is the outcome of a ﬂow of subjective
appearances. And yet I did not actually constitute it, in the sense that I
did not actively and through a process of mental inspection posit the
interrelations of the many aspects presented to the senses, and the relations of all of them to my diﬀerent kinds of sensory apparatus. We have
expressed this by saying that I perceive with my body. The visual thing
appears when my gaze, following the indications oﬀered by the spectacle, and drawing together the light and shade spread over it, ultimately
settles on the lighted surface as upon that which the light reveals. My
gaze ‘knows’ the signiﬁcance of a certain patch of light in a certain
context; it understands the logic of lighting. Expressed in more general
terms, there is a logic of the world to which my body in its entirety
conforms, and through which things of intersensory signiﬁcance
become possible for us. In so far as it is capable of synergy, my body
knows the signiﬁcance, for the totality of my experience, of this or that
colour added or subtracted, and the occurrence of any such change is

the thing and the natural world

immediately picked out from the object’s presentation and general signiﬁcance. To have senses, sight for example, is to possess that general
apparatus, that cast of possible, visual relations with the help of which
we are able to take up any given visual grouping. To have a body is to
possess a universal setting, a schema of all types of perceptual unfolding
and of all those inter-sensory correspondences which lie beyond the
segment of the world which we are actually perceiving. A thing is,
therefore, not actually given in perception, it is internally taken up by us,
reconstituted and experienced by us in so far as it is bound up with a
world, the basic structures of which we carry with us, and of which it is
merely one of many possible concrete forms. Although a part of our
living experience, it is nevertheless transcendent in relation to our life
because the human body, with its habits which weave round it a human
environment, has running through it a movement towards the world
itself. Animal behaviour aims at an animal setting (Umwelt) and centres of
resistance (Widerstand). If we try to subject it to natural stimuli devoid of
concrete signiﬁcance, we produce neuroses.61 Human behaviour opens
upon a world (Welt) and upon an object (Gegenstand) beyond the tools
which it makes for itself, and one may even treat one’s own body as an
object. Human life is deﬁned in terms of this power which it has of
denying itself in objective thought, a power which stems from its primordial attachment to the world itself. Human life ‘understands’ not only
a certain deﬁnite environment, but an inﬁnite number of possible
environments, and it understands itself because it is thrown into a
natural world.
What needs to be elucidated, then, is this primary comprehension of
the world. The natural world, we said, is the schema of intersensory
relations. We do not, following Kant, understand thereby a system of
invariable relations to which every existent thing is subject in so far as
it can be known. It is not like a crystal cube, all the aspects of which can
be conceived in virtue of its geometrical structure, and which even
reveals its hidden sides, since it is transparent. The world has its
unity, although the mind may not have succeeded in inter-relating its
facets and in integrating them into the conception of a geometrized
61

381

382 phenomenology of perception
projection. This unity is comparable with that of an individual whom I
recognize because he is recognizable in an unchallengeably self-evident
way, before I ever succeed in stating the formula governing his character, because he retains the same style in everything he says and does,
even though he may change his place or his opinions. A style is a
certain manner of dealing with situations, which I identify or understand in an individual or in a writer, by taking over that manner myself
in a sort of imitative way, even though I may be quite unable to deﬁne
it: and in any case a deﬁnition, correct though it may be, never provides
an exact equivalent, and is never of interest to any but those who have
already had the actual experience. I experience the unity of the world as
I recognize a style. Yet even so the style of a person, or of a town, does
not remain constant for me. After ten years of friendship, even
independently of any changes brought about by age, I seem to be
dealing with a diﬀerent person, and after ten years of living in a district, it is as if I were in a diﬀerent one. Yet it is only the knowledge of things
which varies. Though almost unnoticed at ﬁrst glance, it is transformed
by the unfolding of perception. The world remains the same world
throughout my life, because it is that permanent being within which I
make all corrections to my knowledge, a world which in its unity
remains unaﬀected by those corrections, and the self-evidence of
which attracts my activity towards the truth through appearance and
error. It is marginal to the child’s ﬁrst perception as a presence as yet
unrecognized but incontrovertible, which knowledge will subsequently make determinate and complete. I may be mistaken, and
need to rearrange my certainties, and reject the being to which my
illusions give rise, but I do not for a moment doubt that in themselves
things have been compatible and compossible, because from the very
start I am in communication with one being, and one only, a vast
individual from which my own experiences are taken, and which persists on the horizon of my life as the distant roar of a great city provides
the background to everything we do in it. It is said that sounds or
colours belong to a sensory ﬁeld, because sounds once perceived can
be followed only by other sounds, or by silence, which is not an
auditory nothingness, but the absence of sounds, and which, therefore,
keeps us in contact with the being of sound. If, during the process of
reﬂection, I cease to hear sounds, and then suddenly become receptive

the thing and the natural world

to them again, they appear to me to be already there, and I pick up a
thread which I had dropped but which is unbroken. The ﬁeld is a
setting that I possess for a certain type of experiences, and which, once
established, cannot be nulliﬁed. Our possession of the world is similar
to this, except that it is possible to conceive a subject with no auditory
ﬁeld, but impossible to conceive a subject with no world.62 Just as, in
the hearing subject, the absence of sounds does not cut oﬀ all communication with the world of sounds, so in the case of a subject deaf
and blind from birth, the absence of the visual and auditory worlds
does not sever all communication with the world in general. There is
always something confronting him, a being to be deciphered, an omnitudo realitatis, and the foundation of this possibility is permanently laid
by the ﬁrst sensory experience, however narrow or imperfect it may be.
We have no other way of knowing what the world is than by actively
accepting this aﬃrmation which is made very instant within us; for any
deﬁnition of the world would be merely a summary and schematic
outline, conveying nothing to us, if we did not already have access to
the determinate, if we did not in fact know it by virtue of the mere fact
that we are. It is upon our experience of the world that all our logical
operations concerned with signiﬁcance must be based, and the world
itself, therefore, is not a certain signiﬁcance common to all our experiences which we discern in them, some idea which breathes life into
the matter of knowledge. The world does not hold for us a set of
outlines which some consciousness within us binds together into a
unity. It is true that the world presents itself as outlines, in the ﬁrst
place spatially; here I can see only the south side of the street, whereas
if I crossed over, I should see the north side; also I see nothing but Paris,
and the countryside which I have just left behind me has relapsed into a
kind of latent life. When we go further into it, spatial outlines are also
temporal: elsewhere is always something we have seen or might see;
and even if I do perceive it as simultaneous with the present, this is
because it is part of the same wave of duration. The town to which I am
drawing nearer, changes its aspects, as I realize when I turn my eyes
away for a moment and then look back at it. But the outlines do not

384 phenomenology of perception
follow each other or stand side by side in front of me. My experience at
these diﬀerent stages is bound up with itself in such a way that I do not
get diﬀerent perspective views linked to each other through the conception of an invariant. The perceiving body does not successively
occupy diﬀerent points of view beneath the gaze of some unlocated
consciousness which is thinking about them. For it is reﬂection which
objectiﬁes points of view of perspectives, whereas when I perceive, I
belong, through my point of view, to the world as a whole, nor am I
even aware of the limits of my visual ﬁeld. The variety of points of view
is hinted at only by an imperceptible shift, a certain ‘blurred’ eﬀect in
the appearance. If the successive outlines are really distinguished from
each other, as in the case of my driving towards a town and looking at
it only intermittently, there is no longer a perception of the town, for I
ﬁnd myself suddenly confronted by another object having no common
measure with its predecessor. I ﬁnally pass the judgement: ‘It is
Chartres’, and weld the two appearances together, but I am able to do
so because they are both extracted from one and the same perception
of the world, which consequently cannot admit of the same discontinuity. We can no more construct perception of the thing and of
the world from discrete aspects, than we can make up the binocular
vision of an object from two monocular images. My experiences of the
world are integrated into one single world as the double image merges
into the one thing, when my ﬁnger stops pressing upon my eyeball. I
do not have one perspective, then another, and between them a link
brought about by the understanding, but each perspective merges into the
other and, in so far as it is still possible to speak of a synthesis, we are
concerned with a ‘transition-synthesis’. It is particularly true that my
present vision is not restricted to what my visual ﬁeld actually presents
to me, for the next room, the landscape behind that hill and the inside
or the back of that object are not recalled or represented. My point of
view is for me not so much a limitation of my experience as a way I
have of inﬁltrating into the world in its entirety. When I see the horizon, it does not make me think of that other landscape which I should
see if I were standing on it, nor does that other landscape make me
think of a third one and so on; I do not visualize anything; all these
landscapes are already there in the harmonious sequence and inﬁnite
unfolding of their perspectives. When I see the bright green of one of

the thing and the natural world

Cézanne’s vases, it does not make me think of pottery, it presents it to
me. The pottery is there, with its thin, smooth outer surface and its
porous inside, in the particular way in which the green varies in shade.
In the inner and outer horizon of the thing or the landscape, there is a
co-presence and co-existence of outlines which is brought into existence through space and time. The natural world is the horizon of all
horizons, the style of all possible styles, which guarantees for my
experiences a given, not a willed, unity underlying all the disruptions
of my personal and historical life. Its counterpart within me is the
given, general and pre-personal existence of my sensory functions in
which we have discovered the deﬁnition of the body.
But how is it possible for me to experience the world as a positively
existing individual, since none of the perspective views of it which I
enjoy exhausts it, since its horizons are always open, and since moreover no knowledge, even scientiﬁc knowledge, provides us with the
invariable formula of a facies totius universi? How can any thing ever really
and truly present itself to us, since its synthesis is never a completed
process, and since I can always expect to see it break down and fall to the
status of a mere illusion? Yet there is something and not nothing. There
is a determinate reality, at least at a certain degree of relativity. Even if in
the last resort I have no absolute knowledge of this stone, and even if my
knowledge regarding it takes me step by step along an inﬁnite road and
cannot ever be complete, the fact remains that the perceived stone is
there, that I recognize it, that I have named it and that we agree on a
certain number of statements about it. Thus it seems that we are led to a
contradiction: belief in the thing and the world must entail the presumption of a completed synthesis—and yet this completion is made
impossible by the very nature of the perspectives which have to be
inter-related, since each one of them, by virtue of its horizons, refers to
other perspectives, and so on indeﬁnitely. There is, indeed, a contradiction, as long as we operate within being, but the contradiction
disappears, or rather is generalized, being linked up with the ultimate
conditions of our experience and becoming one with the possibility of
living and thinking, if we operate in time, and if we manage to understand time as the measure of being. The synthesis of horizons is essentially a temporal process, which means, not that it is subject to time, nor
that it is passive in relation to time, nor that it has to prevail over time,

385

386 phenomenology of perception
but that it merges with the very movement whereby time passes.
Through my perceptual ﬁeld, with its spatial horizons, I am present to my
surrounding, I co-exist with all the other landscapes which stretch out
beyond it, and all these perspectives together form a single temporal
wave, one of the world’s instants. Through my perceptual ﬁeld with its
temporal horizons I am present to my present, to all the preceding past
and to a future. And, at the same time, this ubiquity is not strictly real,
but is clearly only intentional. Although the landscape before my eyes
may well herald the features of the one which is hidden behind the hill,
it does so only subject to a certain degree of indeterminacy: here there
are meadows, over there perhaps woods, and, in any case, beyond the
near horizon, I know only that there will be land or sea, beyond that
either open sea or frozen sea, beyond that again either earth or sky and,
as far as the limits of the earth’s atmosphere are concerned, I know
only that there is, in the most general terms, something to be perceived, and of those remote regions I possess only the style, in the
abstract. In the same way, although each past is progressively enclosed
in its entirety in the more recent past which has followed it, in virtue of
the interlocking of intentionalities, the past degenerates, and the earliest years of my life are lost in the general existence of my body, of
which I now know merely that it was already, at that time, confronted
by colours and sounds, and a nature similar to the one which I now see
before me. I possess the remote past, as I do the future, therefore, only
in principle, and my life is slipping away from me on all sides and is
circumscribed by impersonal zones. The contradiction which we ﬁnd
between the reality of the world and its incompleteness is the contradiction between the omnipresence of consciousness and its involvement in a ﬁeld of presence. But let us look more closely to see whether
in fact we have here a contradiction and a dilemma. Though I may say
that I am enclosed in my present, since after all we pass, by imperceptible
transitions, from the present to the past, from the recent to the remote,
and since it is impossible to separate strictly the present from what is
merely presented in actuality, the transcendence of remote experiences
encroaches upon my present and brings a suspicion of unreality even
into those which I believe to be coincident with my present self.
Though I am here and now, yet I am not here and now. In so far, on the
other hand, as I consider my intentional relationships with the past and

the thing and the natural world

the ‘elsewhere’ as constitutive of the past and the elsewhere, and in so
far as I try to free consciousness from any localization and temporal
abode, in so far as I am everywhere where my perception and memory
lead me, I cannot live in any time, and thus, along with the uniquely
compelling reality which deﬁnes my present here and now, vanishes the
reality of my former or my possible presents. If the synthesis could be
genuine and my experience formed a closed system, if the thing and the
world could be deﬁned once and for all, if the spatio-temporal horizons could, even theoretically, be made explicit and the world conceived from no point of view, then nothing would exist; I should hover
above the world, so that all times and places, far from becoming simultaneously real, would become unreal, because I should live in none of
them and would be involved nowhere. If I am at all times and everywhere, then I am at no time and nowhere. Thus no choice is oﬀered
between the incompleteness of the world and its existence, between
the particular involvement and omnipresence of consciousness,
between transcendence and immanence, since each of these terms
when pronounced singly brings to mind its opposite. What needs to be
understood is that for the same reason I am present here and now, and
present elsewhere and always, and also absent from here and from now,
and absent from every place and from every time. This ambiguity is not
some imperfection of consciousness or existence, but the deﬁnition of
them. Time in the widest sense, that is, the order of co-existences as
well as that of successions, is a setting to which one can gain access and
which one can understand only by occupying a situation in it, and by
grasping it in its entirely through the horizons of that situation. The
world, which is the nucleus of time, subsists only by virtue of that
unique action which both separates and brings together the actually
presented and the present; and consciousness, which is taken to be the
seat of clear thinking, is on the contrary the very abode of ambiguity.
Under these circumstances one may say, if one wishes, that nothing
exists absolutely, and it would, indeed, be more accurate to say that
nothing exists and that everything is ‘temporalized’. But temporality is
not some half-hearted existence. Objective being is not plenary existence. The model is provided for us by these things in front of us which
at ﬁrst glance seem entirely determinate: this stone is white, hard and
cool, and it seems that the world is crystallized in it, that it has no need

387

388 phenomenology of perception
of time in order to exist, that it wholly unfolds itself in the instant, and
that any additional existence would involve it in a fresh coming into
being, so that we are tempted to think that the world, if it is anything at
all, can be only a collection of things analogous to this stone, and time a
collection of perfect instants. Such are the world and time of Descartes,
and it is indeed a fact that this conception of being is almost inevitably
arrived at, since I have a visual ﬁeld with circumscribed objects, and a
sensible present, and since every ‘elsewhere’ is given as another here,
every past and every future as a present gone by or still to come. The
perception of one single thing lays for ever the foundation of the ideal
of objective or explicit knowledge which classical logic develops. But as
soon as we concentrate upon these certainties, and as soon as we set
astir the intentional life which produces them, we become aware that
objective being has its roots in the ambiguities of time. I cannot conceive the world as a sum of things, nor time as a sum of instantaneous
‘present moments’, since each thing can oﬀer itself in its full determinacy only if other things recede into the vagueness of the remote distance, and each present can take on its reality only by excluding the
simultaneous presence of earlier and later presents, and since thus a
sum of things or of presents makes nonsense. Things and instants can
link up with each other to form a world only through the medium of
that ambiguous being known as a subjectivity, and can become present
to each other only from a certain point of view and in intention. Objective time which ﬂows and exists part by part would not be even suspected, were it not enveloped in a historical time which is projected
from the living present towards a past and towards a future. The alleged
plenitude of the object and of the instant springs forth only in face of
the imperfection of the intentional being. A present without a future, or
an eternal present, is precisely the deﬁnition of death; the living present
is torn between a past which it takes up and a future which it projects.
It is thus of the essence of the thing and of the world to present themselves as ‘open’, to send us beyond their determinate manifestations, to
promise us always ‘something else to see’. This is what is sometimes
expressed by saying that the thing and the world are mysterious. They
are indeed, when we do not limit ourselves to their objective aspect, but
put them back into the setting of subjectivity. They are even an absolute
mystery, not amenable to elucidation, and this through no provisional

the thing and the natural world

gap in our knowledge, for in that case it would fall back to the status of
a mere problem, but because it is not of the order of objective thought
in which there are solutions. There is nothing to be seen beyond our
horizons, but other landscapes and still other horizons, and nothing
inside the thing but other smaller things. The ideal of objective thought
is both based upon and ruined by temporality. The world, in the full
sense of the word, is not an object, for though it has an envelope of
objective and determinate attributes, it has also ﬁssures and gaps into
which subjectivities slip and lodge themselves, or rather which are
those subjectivities themselves. We now understand why things, which
owe their meaning to it, are not meanings presented to the intelligence,
but opaque structures, and why their ultimate signiﬁcance remains
confused. The thing and the world exist only in so far as they are
experienced by me or by subjects like me, since they are both the
concatenation of our perspectives, yet they transcend all perspectives
because this chain is temporal and incomplete. I have the impression
that the world itself lives outside me, just as absent landscapes live on
beyond my visual ﬁeld, and as my past was formerly lived on the earlier
side of my present.
Hallucination causes the real to disintegrate before our eyes, and
puts a quasi-reality in its place, and in both these respects this phenomenon brings us back to the pre-logical bases of our knowledge
and conﬁrms what has been said about the thing and the world. The
all-important point is that the patients, most of the time, discriminate
between their hallucinations and their perceptions. Schizophrenics
who experience tactile hallucinations of pricking or of an ‘electric
current’ jump when they feel an injection of ethyl chloride or a real
electric shock: ‘That time,’ they say to the doctor, ‘you were the cause
of it, because you are going to operate.’ Another schizophrenic, who
said he could see a man standing in the garden under his window,
and pointed to the spot, giving a description of the man’s clothes and
general bearing, was astonished when someone was actually placed in
the garden at the spot in question, wearing the same clothes and in
the same posture. He looked carefully, and exclaimed: ‘Yes, there is
someone there, but it’s somebody else.’ He would not admit to there
being two men in the garden. A patient who has never entertained

389

390 phenomenology of perception
any doubts whatsoever about the voices which she hears, listens to
similar ones played to her on the gramophone, interrupts her work,
raises her head without turning round, and sees a white angel appear,
as it does every time she hears her voices, but she does not count this
experience among the day’s ‘voices’: for this time it is not the same
thing, but a ‘direct’ voice, perhaps the doctor’s. An old woman
aﬄicted with senile dementia, who complains of ﬁnding powder in
her bed, is startled to ﬁnd in reality a thin layer of toilet powder there:
‘What is this?’ she asks, ‘this powder is damp, the other is dry.’ The
subject who, in delirium tremens, takes the doctor’s hand to be a
guinea pig, is immediately aware of the fact when a real guinea pig is
placed in his other hand.63 The fact that patients so often say that
someone is talking to them by telephone or radio, is to be taken
precisely as expressing that the morbid world is artiﬁcial, and that it
lacks something needed to become a ‘reality’. The voices are uncouth
voices, or else voices ‘of people pretending to be uncouth’, or it may
be a young man imitating an old man’s voice, or ‘as if a German were
trying to talk Yiddish’.64 ‘It is as when a person says something to
someone, but without getting as far as uttering any sound.’65 Do not
such admissions put an end to all argument about hallucination? Since
the hallucination is not a sensory content, there seems nothing for it
but to regard it as a judgement, an interpretation or a belief. But
although these patients do not believe in their hallucinations in the
sense in which one believes in perceived objects, an intellectualist
theory of hallucination is equally impossible. Alain quotes Montaigne’s words on madmen ‘who believe they see what they do not
really see’.66 But in fact the insane do not believe they see, or, when
questioned, they correct their statements on this point. A hallucination is not a judgement or a rash belief, for the same reasons which
prevent it from being a sensory content: the judgement or the belief
could consist only in positing the hallucination as true, and this is
precisely what the patients do not do. At the level of judgement they

distinguish hallucination from perception, and in any case argue
against their hallucinations: rats cannot come out of the mouth and go
back into the stomach.67 A doctor who hears voices climbs into a boat
and rows towards the open sea to convince himself that no one is
really talking to him.68 When the hallucinatory attack supervenes, the
rat and the voices are still there.
Why do empiricism and intellectualism fail to understand hallucination, and by what other method is there some chance of succeeding?
Empiricism tries to explain hallucination in the same way as it does
perception: through the eﬀect of certain physiological causes, the irritation, for example, of certain nervous centres, sense-data appear as
they appear in perception through the action of physical stimuli on
those same nerve centres. At ﬁrst sight, there is nothing in common
between these physiological hypotheses and the intellectualist conception. In fact there is, as we shall see, this much in common that the two
doctrines presuppose the priority of objective thought, and having at
their disposal only one mode of being, namely objective being, try to
force the phenomenon of hallucination into it. In this way they misconceive it, and overlook its own mode of certainty and its immanent
signiﬁcance since, according to the patient himself, hallucination has
no place in objective being. For empiricism, hallucination is an event in
the chain of events running from the stimulus to the state of consciousness. In intellectualism, an eﬀort is made to get rid of hallucination properly speaking, to construct it, and to deduce what it might
be from a certain idea of consciousness. The cogito teaches us that the
existence of consciousness is indistinguishable from the consciousness
of existing, and that therefore there can be nothing in it of which it is
unaware, and that conversely, everything that it knows with certainty it
ﬁnds in itself; that consequently the truth or falsity of an experience
must not reside in its relation to an external reality, but be capable of
being read oﬀ from it as intrinsic denominations, without which they
could never be recognized. Thus false perceptions are not genuine
perceptions at all. The victim of hallucinations cannot hear or see in the
genuine sense of these words. He judges and believes that he sees or

392 phenomenology of perception
hears, but he does not really see or hear. This conclusion does not leave
even the cogito intact, for the question remains how a subject can believe
that he hears when actually he does not. If it be replied that this belief is
simply assertive, that it is knowledge of the ﬁrst kind, one of those
vague appearances in which one does not believe in the full sense of
the word, and which persist only in the absence of critical scrutiny, in
short a mere de facto state of our knowledge, the question will then be
how a consciousness can be in this state of deﬁciency without being
aware of it, or, if it is aware of it, how it can remain in it.69 The
intellectualist cogito leaves in front of itself only a pure cogitatum which it
possesses and constitutes in its entirety. It is a hopeless task to try to
understand how it can be mistaken about an object which it constitutes. It is therefore the reduction of our experience to so many objects,
the primacy of objective thought, which, here as before, causes us to
lose sight of the phenomenon of hallucination. Between empiricist
explanation and intellectualist reﬂection there is a fundamental kinship, which is their common ignorance of phenomena. Both construct
the hallucinatory phenomenon instead of living it. Even the novelty
and validity in intellectualism—the diﬀerence of nature which it sets
up between perception and hallucination—is impaired by the priority
given to objective thought: if the hallucinated subject objectively knows
or thinks of his hallucination as being what it is, how is hallucinatory
deception possible? All the diﬃculties arise from the fact that objective
thought, the reduction of things as experienced to objects, of subjectivity to the cogitatio, leaves no room for the equivocal adherence of the
subject to preobjective phenomena. The consequence is therefore clear.
We must stop constructing hallucination, or indeed consciousness
generally, according to a certain essence or idea of itself which compels us to deﬁne it in terms of some sort of absolute adequation and
makes arrests in development inconceivable. We learn to know consciousness as we learn to know anything else. When the victim of

Hence Alain’s hesitation: if consciousness always knows itself, it must immediately
distinguish the percept from the ﬁgment of imagination, and we shall say that the
imaginary is not visible. (Système des Beaux-Arts, pp. 15 and ﬀ.) But if there is hallucinatory
deception, then the imaginary must be able to be taken for the percept, and we shall say
that the judgement entails vision. (Quatre-vingtun chapitres sur l’esprit et les passions, p. 18.)

the thing and the natural world

hallucinations declares that he sees and hears, we must not believe
him,70 since he also declares the opposite; what we must do is understand him. We must not be satisﬁed with the opinions of sane consciousness on the subject of hallucinatory consciousness, and regard
ourselves as sole judges of the distinctive signiﬁcance of the hallucination. To which it will doubtless be replied that I have no means of
access to hallucination as it is for itself. The person who mentally
experiences either the hallucination, or another person, or his own
past, never coincides with the hallucination, or with the other person,
or with his past as it was. Knowledge can never overstep this limit of
facticity. This is true, but it must not be used to justify arbitrary constructions. It is true that we should never talk about anything if we were
limited to talking about those experiences with which we coincide,
since speech is already a separation. Moreover there is no experience
without speech, as the purely lived-through has no part in the discursive life of man. The fact, remains, however, that the primary meaning of discourse is to be found in that text of experience which it is
trying to communicate. What is being sought is not a ﬁctitious coincidence of myself and others, of my present self with its past, of the
doctor with the patient; we cannot take over another person’s situation,
relive the past in its reality, or illness as it is lived through by the
patient. The consciousness of others, the past, or illness, can never be
brought down in their existence to what I know of them. But neither
can my own consciousness, in so far as it exists and is committed, be
made to amount simply to what I know of it. If a philosopher produces
hallucinations in himself by means of an insulin injection, either he
yields to the hallucinatory impulse, in which case the hallucination is a
living experience for him and not an object of knowledge, or else he
retains something of his reﬂective power, and it will always be possible
to challenge his testimony, which is not that of a deranged person
‘committed’ to his hallucination. There is, then, no privileged selfknowledge, and other people are no more closed systems than I am
myself. What is given is not myself as opposed to others, my present as
opposed to my past, sane consciousness with its cogito as opposed to
consciousness aﬄicted with hallucinations, the former being sole
70

As Alain accuses the psychologists of doing.

393

394 phenomenology of perception
judge of the latter and limited, in relation to it, to its internal
conjectures—it is the doctor with the patient, myself with others, my
past on the horizon of my present. When I recall my past at the present time
I distort it, but I can allow for these very distortions, for they are
conveyed to me by the tension created between the extinct past at
which I am aiming and my arbitrary interpretations. I misunderstood
another person because I see him from my own point of view, but then
I hear him expostulate, and ﬁnally come round to the idea of the other
person as a centre of perspectives. Within my own situation that of the
patient whom I am questioning makes its appearance and, in this
bipolar phenomenon, I learn to know both myself and others. We must
put ourselves back in the actual situation in which hallucinations and
‘reality’ are presented to us, and grasp their concrete diﬀerentiation at
the time that it operates in communication with the patient. I am
sitting before my subject and chatting with him; he is trying to
describe to me what he ‘sees’ and what he ‘hears’; it is not a question
either of taking him at his word, or of reducing his experiences to
mine, or coinciding with him, or sticking to my own point of view, but
of making explicit my experience, and also his experience as it is
conveyed to me in my own, and his hallucinatory belief and my real
belief, and to understand one through the other.
The fact that I classify the voices and visions of my interlocutor as
hallucinations means that I ﬁnd nothing similar in my visual or auditory world. I am therefore aware of apprehending, through hearing
and particularly through sight, a system of phenomena which makes
up not only a private spectacle, but which is the only possible one for
me and even for others, and this is what is called reality. The perceived
world is not only my world, but the one in which I see the behaviour of
other people take shape, for their behaviour equally aims at this world,
which is the correlative not only of my consciousness, but of any
consciousness which I can possibly encounter. What I see with my eyes
exhausts for me the possibilities of vision. It is true that I see what I do
see only from a certain angle, and I concede that a spectator diﬀerently
placed sees what I can only conjecture. But these other spectacles are
implied in mine at this moment, just as the reverse or the underneath
side of objects is perceived simultaneously with their visible aspect, or
as the next room pre-exists in relation to the perception which I should

the thing and the natural world

actually have if I walked into it. The experiences of other people or
those which await me if I change my position merely develop what is
suggested by the horizons of my present experience, and add nothing
to it. My perception brings into co-existence an indeﬁnite number of
perceptual chains which, if followed up, would conﬁrm it in all
respects and accord with it. My eyes and my hand know that any actual
change of place would produce a sensible response entirely according
to my expectation, and I can feel swarming beneath my gaze the countless mass of more detailed perceptions that I anticipate, and upon
which I already have a hold. I am, therefore, conscious of perceiving a
setting which ‘tolerates’ nothing more than is written or foreshadowed
in my perception, and I am in present communication with a consummate fullness.71 The victim of hallucination enjoys no such belief:
the hallucinatory phenomenon is no part of the world, that is to say, it
is not accessible, there is no deﬁnite path leading from it to all the remaining experiences of the deluded subject, or to the experience of the
sane. ‘Can’t you hear my voices?’ asks the patient; ‘then I must be the
only one to hear them.’72 Hallucinations are played out on a stage
diﬀerent from that of the perceived world, and are in a way superimposed: ‘Do you know,’ says one patient, ‘while we are talking,
someone is saying one thing or another to me. Now where can it all
come from?’73 The fact that the hallucination does not take its place in
the stable and intersubjective world means that it lacks the fullness, the
inner articulation which makes the real thing reside ‘in itself’, and act
and exist by itself. The hallucinatory thing is not, as is the real thing,
packed with small perceptions which sustain it in existence. It is an
implicit and inarticulate signiﬁcance. Confronted by the real thing, our
behaviour feels itself motivated by ‘stimuli’ which ﬁll out and vindicate
its intention. Where a phantasm is concerned, the initiative comes
from us, and it has no external counterpart.74 The hallucinatory thing is
not, like the real thing, a form of being with depth, which compresses

within itself a thickness of duration; nor is hallucination, like perception, my concrete hold on time in a living present. It glides over time as
it does over the surface of the world. The person who speaks to me in
my dream has no sooner opened his mouth before his thought is
conveyed miraculously to me; I know what the person is saying to me
before he says anything at all. The hallucination is not in the world but
‘before’ it, because the patient’s body no longer enjoys its insertion
into the system of appearances. All hallucination bears initially on one’s
own body. ‘It is as if I heard with my mouth.’ ‘The person speaking is
on my lips,’ say patients.75 In ‘feelings of bodily presence’ (leibhaften
Bewusstheiten) patients feel the presence of someone they never see close
to them, or behind them, or on them, and they experience that presence as drawing closer or receding. One schizophrenic woman constantly has the impression that she is being seen naked from behind.
George Sand has a double whom she has never seen, but who sees her
the whole time and calls her by her name with her own voice.76
Depersonalization and disturbance of the body image are immediately
translated into an external phantasm, because it is one and the same
thing for us to perceive our body and to perceive our situation in a
certain physical and human setting, for our body is nothing but that
very situation in so far as it is realized and actualized. In extracampine* hallucination the patient believes that he sees a man behind
him, that he sees simultaneously in all directions round about him, that
he can look through a window situated behind his back.77 The illusion
of seeing is, therefore, much less the presentation of an illusory object
than the spread and, so to speak, running wild of a visual power which
has lost any sensory counterpart. There are hallucinations because
through the phenomenal body we are in constant relationship with an
environment into which that body is projected, and because, when
divorced from its actual environment, the body remains able to summon up, by means of its own settings, the pseudo-presence of that

environment. To that extent, the thing in hallucination is never seen
and is never visible. One subject, under mescalin, sees the screw of a
piece of apparatus as a glass bulb or a protuberance on a rubber balloon. But what precisely does he see? ‘I perceive a world covered with
swellings. . . . It is as if my perception suddenly changed key to become
perception in intumescence, as one plays a piece of music in C or B
ﬂat. . . . Just then, my whole perception was transformed and, for an
instant, I perceived a rubber bulb. Does that mean that I saw nothing
else? No, but I had the feeling of being transferred to a setting such that
I could perceive in no other way. The belief took possession of me that
the world is thus. . . . Later another change took place. . . . Everything
seemed at once clammy and scaly, like some of the large serpents I have
seen uncoiling themselves at the Berlin Zoo. Then I was seized with the
fear of being on a small island surrounded by serpents.’78 Hallucination
does not present me with protuberances, or scales, or words like ponderous realities gradually revealing their meaning. It does no more than
reproduce for me the way in which these realities strike me in my
being of feeling and of language. When the patient refuses food
because it is ‘poisoned’, we need to realize that for him the word has
not the sense that it would have for a chemist:79 the patient does not
believe that the food possesses properties which are actually poisonous
to the objective body. The poison in this case is an aﬀective entity, a
magic presence comparable to that of illness or misfortune. The majority of hallucinations are not things with diﬀerent facets, but short-lived
phenomena, such as pricking sensations, jolts, explosions, draughts,
waves of cold or heat, sparks, points of bright light, glowing lights or
silhouetted shapes.80 When it is a question of real things, a rat for
example, these are represented only by their general style and physiognomy. These disjoined phenomena do not admit of precise causal
connections among themselves. Their sole mutual relationship is one
of co-existence—a co-existence which always has a signiﬁcance for the
patient, since awareness of contingency presupposes deﬁnite and distinct causal sequences, and since we are here among the odd remnants

of a world in ruins. ‘A running nose becomes a speciﬁc ﬂow, and the
fact of dozing in an underground train acquires a strange and unique
signiﬁcance’.81 Hallucinations are associated with a certain sensory
realm only in so far as each sensory ﬁeld provides the distortion of
existence with particular possibilities of expression. The schizophrenic’s
hallucinations are predominantly auditory and tactile, because the
world of hearing and touch, in virtue of its natural structure, is better
able to stand for an existence which is possessed, jeopardized and deindividualized. The heavy drinker experiences predominantly visual
hallucinations because sight provides the disordered processes with a
means of calling into being an opponent or a task which have to be
faced.82 The victim of hallucination does not see and hear in the normal sense, but makes use of his sensory ﬁelds and his natural insertion
into a world in order to build up, out of the fragments of this world, an
artiﬁcial world answering to the total intention of his being.
But though hallucination is not a sensory process, still less is it a
judgement. It is not given to the subject as a construction, and has no
place in the ‘geographical world’, in the being, that is, which we know
and judge, in the network of facts subject to laws, but in the individual
‘landscape’83 through which the world impinges upon us, and by
means of which we are in vital communication with it. A woman
patient declares that someone looked at her at the market, and that she
felt the gaze fall upon her like a blow, but could not say whence it came.
She cannot bring herself to say that in common property space there
stood a ﬂesh and blood person who turned his eyes towards her—and

Ibid. The patient ‘lives within the horizon of his landscape, under the sway of univocal
impressions which, lacking any motif or basis, are no longer made to ﬁt into the universal order of the world of things, or into the universal sense-relationships of language.
The things to which patients refer by familiar names have ceased to be the same things
for them that they are for us. What they have retained and made into parts of their
landscape are mere broken remnants of our world, and even these do not remain what
they were as parts of the whole.’ Things for the schizophrenic are frozen and inert,
whereas those of delirium are communicative and living to a greater degree than are
ours. ‘If the illness grows worse, the disintegration of thought and the disappearance
of speech reveal the loss of geographical space, and the blunted feelings reveal the
impoverishment of the landscape.’ (Straus, op. cit., p. 291.)

the thing and the natural world

it is because of this refusal that the arguments that we can bring against
her leave her completely unmoved. For her it is not a matter of what
happens in the objective world, but of what she encounters, what
touches her or strikes her. The food refused by the victim of hallucinations is poisoned only for him, but to this extent it is poisoned irrefutably. The hallucination is not a perception, but it has the value of reality, and
it alone counts for the victim. The world has lost its expressive force,84
and the hallucinatory system has usurped it. Although hallucination is
not a perception, there is a hallucinatory deception, and this is what we
shall never understand if we take hallucination to be an intellectual
operation. However diﬀerent it is from a perception, hallucination
must be able to supplant it, and exist for the patient in a higher degree
than his own perceptions. This can be so only so long as hallucination
and perception are modalities of one single primordial function,
through which we arrange round about us a setting of deﬁnite structure, through which we are enabled to place ourselves at one time fairly
and squarely in the world, and at another marginally to it. The patient’s
existence is displaced from its centre, being no longer enacted through
dealings with a harsh, resistant and intractable world which has no
knowledge of us, but expending its substance in isolation creating a
ﬁctitious setting for itself. But this ﬁction can have the value of reality only because
in the normal subject reality itself suﬀers through an analogous process. In so far as he
too has sensory ﬁelds and a body, the normal person is equally aﬄicted
with this gaping wound through which illusion can make its way in.
His representation of the world is no less vulnerable. In so far as we
believe what we see, we do so without any veriﬁcation, and the mistake
of the traditional theories of perception is to introduce into perception
itself intellectual operations and a critical examination of the evidence
of the senses, to which we in fact resort only when direct perception
founders in ambiguity. In the case of the normal subject private
experience, independently of any express veriﬁcation, links up with
itself and with experiences of external origin, so that the landscape
opens on to a geographical world and tends towards absolute plenitude. The normal person does not ﬁnd satisfaction in subjectivity, he

runs away from it, he is genuinely concerned with being in the world,
and his hold on time is direct and unreﬂecting, whereas the suﬀerer
from hallucinations simply exploits his being in the world in order to
carve a private sector for himself out of the common property world,
and constantly runs up against the transcendence of time. Underlying
express acts which enable me to posit before myself an object at its
distance, standing in a deﬁnite relation to other objects, and having
speciﬁc characteristics which can be observed, underlying perceptions
properly understood, there is, then, sustaining them, a deeper function
without which perceived objects would lack the distinctive sign of
reality, as they do for the schizophrenic, and through which they begin
to count or be valid for us. It is the momentum which carries us
beyond subjectivity, which gives us our place in the world prior to any
science and any veriﬁcation, through a kind of ‘faith’ or ‘primary
opinion’85—or which may, on the other hand, become bogged down
in our private appearances. In this realm of primary opinion, hallucinatory illusion is possible even though hallucination is never perception,
and though the true world is always suspected as there by the patient,
even as he turns away from it, because we are still in the antepredicative
world, and because the connection between appearance and total
experience is merely implicit and presumptive, even in the case of true
perception. The child attributes his dreams, no less than his perceptions, to the world; he believes that the dream is enacted in his room, at
the foot of his bed, the sole diﬀerence from perception being that the
dream is visible to sleepers alone.86 The world is still the vague theatre
of all experiences. It takes in without discrimination real objects on the
one hand and individual and momentary phantasms on the other—
because it is an individual which embraces everything and not a collection of objects linked by causal relations. To have hallucinations and
more generally to imagine, is to exploit this tolerance on the part of the
antepredicative world, and our bewildering proximity to the whole of
being in syncretic experience.
We succeed, therefore, in accounting for hallucinatory deception
only by removing apodeictic certainty from perception and full

the thing and the natural world

self-possession from perceptual consciousness. The existence of the
percept is never necessary, since perception entails a process of making
explicit which could be pursued to inﬁnity and which, moreover,
could not gain in one direction without losing in another, and without
being exposed to the risks of time. But it must not be concluded from
this that the perceived is only possible or probable, and that it can be
brought down, for instance, to a permanent possibility of perception.
Possibility and probability presuppose the prior experience of error,
and correspond to a state of doubt. The percept is and remains, despite
all critical education, on the hither side of doubt and demonstration.
The sun ‘rises’ for the scientist in the same way as it does for the
uneducated person, and our scientiﬁc representations of the solar system remain matters of hearsay, like lunar landscapes, and we never
believe in them in the sense in which we believe in the sunrise. The
sunrise and the percept in general is ‘real’, and we spontaneously
identify them as part of the world. Each perception, though always
capable of being ‘cancelled’ and relegated among illusions, disappears
only to give place to another perception which rectiﬁes it. Each thing
can, after the event, appear uncertain, but what is at least certain for us
is that there are things, that is to say, a world. To ask oneself whether
the world is real is to fail to understand what one is asking, since the
world is not a sum of things which might always be called into question, but the inexhaustible reservoir from which things are drawn. The
percept taken in its entirety, with the world horizon which announces both
its possible disjunction and its possible replacement by another perception, certainly
does not mislead us. There could not possibly be error where there is
not yet truth, but reality, and not yet necessity, but facticity. Correspondingly, we must refuse to attribute to perceptual consciousness
the full possession of itself, and that immanence which would rule out
any possible illusion. If hallucinations are to be possible, it is necessary
that consciousness should, at some moment, cease to know what it is
doing, otherwise it would be conscious of constituting an illusion, and
would not stand by it, so there would no longer be any illusion at all.
And if, as we have said, the illusory thing and the true thing do not have
the same structure, for the patient to assent to the illusion, he must
forget or repress the true world, and cease to refer back to it, and retain
at least the ability to revert to the primitive confusion of the true and

401

402 phenomenology of perception
the false. Yet we do not cut consciousness oﬀ from itself, which would
preclude all progress of knowledge beyond primary opinion, and especially the philosophic examination of primary opinion as the basis of
all knowledge. All that is required is that the concidence of myself with
myself, as it is achieved in the cogito, shall never be a real coincidence,
but merely an intentional and presumptive one. In fact, between myself
who have just thought this, and myself who am thinking that I have
thought it, there is interposed already a thickness of duration, so that I
may always doubt whether that thought which has already passed was
indeed such as I now see it to have been. Since, furthermore, I have no
other evidence of my past than present testimony and yet do have the
idea of a past, I have no reason to set the unreﬂective, as an unknowable, over against the reﬂection which I bring to bear on it. But my
conﬁdence in reﬂection amounts in the last resort to my accepting
and acting on the fact of temporality, and the fact of the world as
the invariable framework of all illusion and all disillusion: I know
myself only in my inherence in time and in the world, that is, I
know myself only in ambiguity.

4
OTHER SELVES AND THE
HUMAN WORLD
I am thrown into a nature, and that nature appears not only as outside
me, in objects devoid of history, but it is also discernible at the centre
of subjectivity. Theoretical and practical decisions of personal life may
well lay hold, from a distance, upon my past and my future, and bestow
upon my past, with all its fortuitous events, a deﬁnite signiﬁcance, by
following it up with a future which will be seen after the event as
foreshadowed by it, thus introducing historicity into my life. Yet these
sequences have always something artiﬁcial about them. It is at the
present time that I realize that the ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve years of my life were
a prolonged childhood, destined to be followed by a painful break
leading eventually to independence. If I take myself back to those years
as I actually lived them and as I carry them within me, my happiness at
that time cannot be explained in terms of the sheltered atmosphere of
the parental home; the world itself was more beautiful, things were
more fascinating, and I can never be sure of reaching a fuller understanding of my past than it had of itself at the time I lived through it,
nor of silencing its protest. The interpretation which I now give of it is
bound up with my conﬁdence in psychoanalysis. Tomorrow, with
more experience and insight, I shall possibly understand it diﬀerently,
and consequently reconstruct my past in a diﬀerent way. In any case, I

404 phenomenology of perception
shall go on to interpret my present interpretations in their turn, revealing their latent content and, in order ﬁnally to assess their truth-value, I
shall need to keep these discoveries in mind. My hold on the past and
the future is precarious, and my possession of my own time is always
postponed until a stage when I may fully understand it, yet this stage
can never be reached, since it would be one more moment, bounded
by the horizon of its future, and requiring in its turn further developments in order to be understood. My voluntary and rational life, therefore, knows that it merges into another power which stands in the way
of its completion, and gives it a permanently tentative look. Natural
time is always there. The transcendence of the instants of time is both
the ground of, and the impediment to, the rationality of my personal
history: the ground because it opens a totally new future to me in
which I shall be able to reﬂect upon the element of opacity in my
present, a source of danger in so far as I shall never manage to seize the
present through which I live with apodeictic certainty, and since the
lived is thus never entirely comprehensible, what I understand never
quite tallies with my living experience, in short, I am never quite at one
with myself. Such is the lot of a being who is born, that is, who once
and for all has been given to himself as something to be understood.
Since natural time remains at the centre of my history, I see myself
surrounded by it. The fact that my earliest years lie behind me like an
unknown land is not attributable to any chance lapse of memory, or
any failure to think back adequately: there is nothing to be known in
these unexplored lands. For example, in pre-natal existence, nothing
was perceived, and therefore there is nothing to recall. There was nothing but the raw material and adumbration of a natural self and a natural
time. This anonymous life is merely the extreme form of that temporal
dispersal which constantly threatens the historical present. In order to
have some inkling of the nature of that amorphous existence which
preceded my own history, and which will bring it to a close, I have
only to look within me at that time which pursues its own independent
course, and which my personal life utilizes but does not entirely overlay. Because I am borne into personal existence by a time which I do
not constitute, all my perceptions stand out against a background
of nature. While I perceive, and even without having any knowledge of
the organic conditions of my perception, I am aware of drawing

other selves and the human world

together somewhat absentminded and dispersed “consciousnesses”:
sight, hearing and touch, with their ﬁelds, which are anterior, and
remain alien, to my personal life. The natural object is the track left by
this generalized existence. And every object will be, in the ﬁrst place
and in some respect, a natural object, made up of colours, tactile and
auditory qualities, in so far as it is destined to enter my life.
Just as nature ﬁnds its way to the core of my personal life and
becomes inextricably linked with it, so behavior patterns settle into that
nature, being deposited in the form of a cultural world. Not only have I
a physical world, not only do I live in the midst of earth, air and water,
I have around me roads, plantations, villages, streets, churches, implements, a bell, a spoon, a pipe. Each of these objects is moulded to the
human action which it serves. Each one spreads round it an atmosphere
of humanity which may be determinate in a low degree, in the case of a
few footmarks in the sand, or on the other hand highly determinate, if I
go into every room from top to bottom of a house recently evacuated.
Now, although it may not be surprising that the sensory and perceptual
functions should lay down a natural world in front of themselves, since
they are prepersonal, it may well seem strange that the spontaneous
acts through which man has patterned his life should be deposited, like
some sediment, outside himself and lead an anonymous existence as
things. The civilization in which I play my part exists for me in a selfevident way in the implements with which it provides itself. If it is a
question of an unknown or alien civilization, then several manners of
being or of living can ﬁnd their place in the ruins or the broken
instruments which I discover, or in the landscape through which I
roam. The cultural world is then ambiguous, but it is already present. I
have before me a society to be known. An Objective Spirit dwells in the
remains and the scenery. How is this possible? In the cultural object, I
feel the close presence of others beneath a veil of anonymity. Someone
uses the pipe for smoking, the spoon for eating, the bell for summoning, and it is through the perception of a human act and another
person that the perception of a cultural world could be veriﬁed. How
can an action or a human thought be grasped in the mode of the ‘one’
since, by its very nature, it is a ﬁrst person operation, inseparable from
an I? It is easy to reply that the indeﬁnite pronoun is here no more than
a vague formula for referring to a multiplicity of I’s or even a general I.

405

406 phenomenology of perception
It will be said that I experience a certain cultural environment along
with behaviour corresponding to it: faced with the remains of an
extinct civilization, I conceive analogically the kind of man who lived
in it. But the ﬁrst need is to know how I experience my own cultural
world, my own civilization. The reply will once more be that I see a
certain use made by other men of the implements which surround
me, that I interpret their behaviour by analogy with my own, and
through my inner experience, which teaches me the signiﬁcance and
intention of perceived gestures. In the last resort, the actions of others
are, according to this theory, always understood through my own; the
‘one’ or the ‘we’ through the ‘I’. But this is precisely the question:
how can the word ‘I’ be put into the plural, how can a general idea of
the I be formed, how can I speak of an I other than my own, how can I
know that there are other I’s, how can consciousness which, by its
nature, and as self-knowledge, is in the mode of the I, be grasped in
the mode of Thou, and through this, in the world of the ‘One’? The
very ﬁrst of all cultural objects, and the one by which all the rest exist,
is the body of the other person as the vehicle of a form of behaviour.
Whether it be a question of vestiges or the body of another person, we
need to know how an object in space can become the eloquent relic of
an existence; how, conversely, an intention, a thought or a project can
detach themselves from the personal subject and become visible outside him in the shape of his body, and in the environment which he
builds for himself. The constitution of the other person does not fully
elucidate that of society, which is not an existence involving two or
even three people, but co-existence involving an indeﬁnite number of
consciousness. Yet the analysis of the perception of others runs up
against a diﬃculty in principle raised by the cultural world, since it is
called upon to solve the paradox of a consciousness seen from the
outside, of a thought which has its abode in the external world, and
which, therefore, is already subjectless and anonymous compared with
mine.
What we have said about the body provides the beginning of a
solution to this problem. The existence of other people is a diﬃculty
and an outrage for objective thought. If the events of the world are, in
Lachelier’s words, a network of general properties standing at the point
of intersection of functional relations which, in principle, enable the

other selves and the human world

analysis of the former to be carried through, and if the body is indeed a
province of the world, if it is that object which the biologist talks
about, that conjunction of processes analysed in physiological logical
treatises, that collection of organs shown in the plates of books on
anatomy, then my experience can be nothing but the dialogue between
bare consciousness and the system of objective correlations which it
conceives. The body of another, like my own, is not inhabited, but is an
object standing before the consciousness which thinks about or constitutes it. Other men, and myself, seen as empirical beings, are merely
pieces of mechanism worked by springs, but the true subject is
irrepeatable, for that consciousness which is hidden in so much ﬂesh
and blood is the least intelligible of occult qualities. My consciousness,
being co-extensive with what can exist for me, and corresponding to
the whole system of experience, cannot encounter, in that system,
another consciousness capable of bringing immediately to light in the
world the background, unknown to me, of its own phenomena. There
are two modes of being, and two only: being in itself, which is that of
objects arrayed in space, and being for itself, which is that of consciousness. Now, another person would seem to stand before me as an
in-itself and yet to exist for himself, thus requiring of me, in order to be
perceived, a contradictory operation, since I ought both to distinguish
him from myself, and therefore place him in the world of objects, and
think of him as a consciousness, that is, the sort of being with no
outside and no parts, to which I have access merely because that being
is myself, and because the thinker and the thought about are amalgamated in him. There is thus no place for other people and a plurality of
consciousnesses in objective thought. In so far as I constitute the world,
I cannot conceive another consciousness, for it too would have to
constitute the world and, at least as regards this other view of the
world, I should not be the constituting agent. Even if I succeeded in
thinking of it as constituting the world, it would be I who would be
constituting the consciousness as such, and once more I should be the
sole constituting agent.
But we have in fact learned to shed doubt upon objective thought,
and have made contact, on the hither side of scientiﬁc representations
of the world and the body, with an experience of the body and the
world which these scientiﬁc approaches do not successfully embrace.

407

408 phenomenology of perception
My body and the world are no longer objects co-ordinated together by
the kind of functional relationships that physics establishes. The system
of experience in which they intercommunicate is not spread out before
me and ranged over by a constituting consciousness. I have the world as
an incomplete individual, through the agency of my body as the potentiality of this world, and I have the positing of objects through that of
my body, or conversely the positing of my body through that of
objects, not in any kind of logical implication, as we determine an
unknown size through its objective relations to given sizes, but in a real
implication, and because my body is a movement towards the world,
and the world my body’s point of support. The ideal of objective
thought—the system of experience conceived as a cluster of physicomathematical correlations—is grounded in my perception of the world
as an individual concordant with itself, and when science tries to
include my body among the relationships obtaining in the objective
world, it is because it is trying, in its way, to translate the suturation of
my phenomenal body on to the primordial world. At the same time as
the body withdraws from the objective world, and forms between the
pure subject and the object a third genus of being, the subject loses its
purity and its transparency. Objects stand before me and throw on to
my retina a certain projection of themselves, and I perceive them.
There can no longer be any question of isolating, in my physiological
representation of the phenomenon, the retinal images and their cerebral counterpart from the total ﬁeld, actual and possible, in which they
appear. The physiological event is merely the abstract schema of the
perceptual event.1 Nor can one invoke, under the name of mental
images, discontinuous, perspective views corresponding to the successive retinal images, or ﬁnally bring in an ‘inspection of the mind’
which restores the object beyond the distorting perspectives. We must
conceive the perspectives and the point of view as our insertion into
the world-as-an-individual, and perception, no longer as a constitution
of the true object, but as our inherence in things. Consciousness discovers in itself, along with the sensory ﬁelds and with the world as the
ﬁeld of all ﬁelds, the opacity of a primary past. If I experience this
inhering of my consciousness in its body and its world, the perception
1

other selves and the human world

of other people and the plurality of consciousnesses no longer present
any diﬃculty. If, for myself who am reﬂecting on perception, the perceiving subject appears provided with a primordial setting in relation
to the world, drawing in its train that bodily thing in the absence of
which there would be no other things for it, then why should other
bodies which I perceive not be similarly inhabited by consciousnesses?
If my consciousness has a body, why should other bodies not ‘have’
consciousnesses? Clearly this involves a profound transformation of the
notions of body and consciousness. As far as the body is concerned,
even the body of another, we must learn to distinguish it from the
objective body as set forth in works on physiology. This is not the body
which is capable of being inhabited by a consciousness. We must grasp
again on visible bodies those forms of behaviour which are outlined
there and which appear on them, but are not really contained in them.2
How signiﬁcance and intentionality could come to dwell in molecular
ediﬁces or masses of cells is a thing which can never be made comprehensible, and here Cartesianism is right. But there is, in any case, no
question of any such absurd undertaking. It is simply a question of
recognizing that the body, as a chemical structure or an agglomeration
of tissues, is formed, by a process of impoverishment, from a primordial phenomenon of the body-for-us, the body of human experience
or the perceived body, round which objective thought works, but
without being called upon to postulate its completed analysis. As for
consciousness, it has to be conceived, no longer as a constituting consciousness and, as it were, a pure being-for-itself, but as a perceptual
consciousness, as the subject of a pattern of behaviour, as being-in-theworld or existence, for only thus can another appear at the top of his
phenomenal body, and be endowed with a sort of ‘locality’. Under
these conditions the antinomies of objective thought vanish. Through
phenomenological reﬂection I discover vision, not as a ‘thinking about
seeing’, to use Descartes’ expression, but as a gaze at grips with a
visible world, and that is why for me there can be another’s gaze; that
expressive instrument called a face can carry an existence, as my own
existence is carried by my body, that knowledge-acquiring apparatus.

This task we have tried to perform elsewhere. (La Structure du Comportement, Chaps. I
and II.)

409

410 phenomenology of perception
When I turn towards perception, and pass from direct perception to
thinking about that perception, I reenact it, and ﬁnd at work in my
organs of perception a thinking older than myself of which those
organs are merely the trace. In the same way I understand the existence
of other people. Here again I have only the trace of a consciousness
which evades me in its actuality and, when my gaze meets another
gaze, I re-enact the alien existence in a sort of reﬂection. There is
nothing here resembling ‘reasoning by analogy’. As Scheler so rightly
declares, reasoning by analogy presupposes what it is called on to
explain. The other consciousness can be deduced only if the emotional
expressions of others are compared and identiﬁed with mine, and
precise correlations recognized between my physical behaviour and my
‘psychic events’. Now the perception of others is anterior to, and the
condition of, such observations, the observations do not constitute the
perception. A baby of ﬁfteen months opens its mouth if I playfully take
one of its ﬁngers between my teeth and pretend to bite it. And yet it has
scarcely looked at its face in a glass, and its teeth are not in any case like
mine. The fact is that its own mouth and teeth, as it feels them from the
inside, are immediately, for it, an apparatus to bite with, and my jaw, as
the baby sees it from the outside, is immediately, for it, capable of the
same intentions. ‘Biting’ has immediately, for it, an intersubjective
signiﬁcance. It perceives its intentions in its body, and my body with its
own, and thereby my intentions in its own body. The observed correlations between my physical behaviour and that of others, my intentions
and my pantomime, may well provide me with a clue in the methodical attempt to know others and on occasions when direct perception
fails, but they do not teach me the existence of others. Between my
consciousness and my body as I experience it, between this phenomenal body of mine and that of another as I see it from the outside, there
exists an internal relation which causes the other to appear as the
completion of the system. The other can be evident to me because I am
not transparent for myself, and because my subjectivity draws its body
in its wake. We were saying earlier: in so far as the other resides in the
world, is visible there, and forms a part of my ﬁeld, he is never an Ego
in the sense in which I am one for myself. In order to think of him as a
genuine 1, I ought to think of myself as a mere object for him, which I
am prevented from doing by the knowledge which I have of myself.

other selves and the human world

But if another’s body is not an object for me, nor mine an object for
him, if both are manifestations of behaviour, the positing of the other
does not reduce me to the status of an object in his ﬁeld, nor does my
perception of the other reduce him to the status of an object in mine.
The other person is never quite a personal being, if I myself am totally
one, and if I grasp myself as apodeictically self-evident. But if I ﬁnd in
myself, through reﬂection, along with the perceiving subject, a prepersonal subject given to itself, and if my perceptions are centred outside me as sources of initiative and judgment, if the perceived world
remains in a state of neutrality, being neither veriﬁed as an object nor
recognized as a dream, then it is not the case that everything that
appears in the world is arrayed before me, and so the behaviour of
others can have its place there. This world may remain undivided
between my perception and his, the self which perceives is in no
particularly privileged position which rules out a perceived self; both
are, not cogitationes shut up in their own immanence, but beings which
are outrun by their world, and which consequently may well be outrun
by each other. The aﬃrmation of an alien consciousness standing over
against mine would immediately make my experience into a private
spectacle, since it would no longer be co-extensive with being. The
cogito of another person strips my own cogito of all value, and causes me
to lose the assurance which I enjoyed in my solitude of having access to
the only being conceivable for me, being, that is, as it is aimed at and
constituted by me. But we have learned in individual perception not to
conceive our perspective views as independent of each other; we know
that they slip into each other and are brought together ﬁnally in the
thing. In the same way we must learn to ﬁnd the communication
between one consciousness and another in one and the same world. In
reality, the other is not shut up inside my perspective of the world,
because this perspective itself has no deﬁnite limits, because it slips
spontaneously into the other’s, and because both are brought together
in the one single world in which we all participate as anonymous
subjects of perception.
In so far as I have sensory functions, a visual, auditory and tactile
ﬁeld, I am already in communication with others taken as similar
psycho-physical subjects. No sooner has my gaze fallen upon a living
body in process of acting than the objects surrounding it immediately

411

412 phenomenology of perception
take on a fresh layer of signiﬁcance: they are no longer simply what I
myself could make of them, they are what this other pattern of
behaviour is about to make of them. Round about the perceived body a
vortex forms, towards which my world is drawn and, so to speak,
sucked in: to this extent, it is no longer merely mine, and no longer
merely present, it is present to x, to that other manifestation of
behaviour which begins to take shape in it. Already the other body has
ceased to be a mere fragment of the world, and become the theatre of a
certain process of elaboration, and, as it were, a certain ‘view’ of the
world. There is taking place over there a certain manipulation of things
hitherto my property. Someone is making use of my familiar objects.
But who can it be? I say that it is another, a second self, and this I know
in the ﬁrst place because this living body has the same structure as
mine. I experience my own body as the power of adopting certain
forms of behaviour and a certain world, and I am given to myself
merely as a certain hold upon the world; now, it is precisely my body
which perceives the body of another, and discovers in that other body a
miraculous prolongation of my own intentions, a familiar way of dealing with the world. Henceforth, as the parts of my body together
compromise a system, so my body and the other’s are one whole, two
sides of one and the same phenomenon, and the anonymous existence
of which my body is the ever-renewed trace henceforth inhabits both
bodies simultaneously.3 All of which makes another living being, but
not yet another man. But this alien life, like mine with which it is in
communication, is an open life. It is not entirely accounted for by a
certain number of biological or sensory functions. It annexes natural
objects by diverting them from their immediate signiﬁcance, it makes
tools for itself, and projects itself into the environment in the shape of
cultural objects. The child ﬁnds them around him at birth like meteorites from another planet. He appropriates them and learns to use them
as others do, because the body image ensures the immediate correspondence of what he sees done and what he himself does, and
because in that way the implement is ﬁxed in his mind as a determinate
manipulandum, and other people as centres of human action. There is one

particular cultural object which is destined to play a crucial rôle in the
perception of other people: language. In the experience of dialogue,
there is constituted between the other person and myself a common
ground; my thought and his are inter-woven into a single fabric, my
words and those of my interlocutor are called forth by the state of the
discussion, and they are inserted into a shared operation of which
neither of us is the creator. We have here a dual being, where the other
is for me no longer a mere bit of behaviour in my transcendental ﬁeld,
nor I in his; we are collaborators for each other in consummate
reciprocity. Our perspectives merge into each other, and we co-exist
through a common world. In the present dialogue, I am freed from
myself, for the other person’s thoughts are certainly his; they are not of
my making, though I do grasp them the moment they come into being,
or even anticipate them. And indeed, the objection which my interlocutor raises to what I say draws from me thoughts which I had no
idea I possessed, so that at the same time that I lend him thoughts, he
reciprocates by making me think too. It is only retrospectively, when I
have withdrawn from the dialogue and am recalling it that I am able to
reintegrate it into my life and make of it an episode in my private
history, and that the other recedes into his absence, or, in so far as her
remains present for me, is felt as a threat. The perception of other
people and the intersubjective world is problematical only for adults.
The child lives in a world which he unhesitatingly believes accessible to
all around him. He has no awareness of himself or of others as private
subjectivities, nor does he suspect that all of us, himself included, are
limited to one certain point of view of the world. That is why he
subjects neither his thoughts, in which he believes as they present
themselves, without attempting to link them to each other, nor our
words, to any sort of criticism. He has no knowledge of points of view.
For him men are empty heads turned towards one single, self-evident
world where everything takes place, even dreams, which are, he thinks,
in his room, and even thinking, since it is not distinct from words.
Others are for him so many gazes which inspect things, and have an
almost material existence, so much so that the child wonders how
these gazes avoid being broken as they meet.4 At about twelve years

413

414 phenomenology of perception
old, says Piaget, the child achieves the cogito and reaches the truths of
rationalism. At this stage, it is held, he discovers himself both as a point
of view on the world and also as called upon to transcend that point of
view, and to construct an objectivity at the level of judgement. Piaget
brings the child to a mature outlook as if the thoughts of the adult were
self-suﬃcient and disposed of all contradictions. But, in reality, it must
be the case that the child’s outlook is in some way vindicated against
the adult’s and against Piaget, and that the unsophisticated thinking of
our earliest years remains as an indispensable acquisition underlying
that of maturity, if there is to be for the adult one single intersubjective
world. My awareness of constructing an objective truth would never
provide me with anything more than an objective truth for me, and my
greatest attempt at impartiality would never enable me to prevail over
my subjectivity (as Descartes so well expresses it by the hypothesis of
the malignant demon), if I had not, underlying my judgements, the
primordial certainty of being in contact with being itself, if, before any
voluntary adoption of a position I were not already situated in an intersubjective world, and if science too were not upheld by this basic δοξα. With
the cogito begins that struggle between consciousnesses, each one of
which, as Hegel says, seeks the death of the other. For the struggle ever
to begin, and for each consciousness to be capable of suspecting the
alien presences which it negates, all must necessarily have some common ground and be mindful of their peaceful co-existence in the
world of childhood.
But is it indeed other people that we arrive at in this way? What we
do in eﬀect is to iron out the I and the Thou in an experience shared by
a plurality, thus introducing the impersonal into the heart of subjectivity and eliminating the individuality of perspectives. But have we not,
in this general confusion, done away with the alter Ego as well as the
Ego? We said earlier that they are mutually exclusive. But this is only
because they both lay the same claims, and because the alter Ego follows all the variations of the Ego: if the perceiving I is genuinely an I, it
cannot perceive a diﬀerent one; if the perceiving subject is anonymous,
the other which it perceives is equally so; so when, within this collective consciousness, we try to bring out the plurality of consciousnesses,
we shall ﬁnd ourselves back with the diﬃculties which we thought we
had left behind. I perceive the other as a piece of behaviour, for

other selves and the human world

example, I perceive the grief or the anger of the other in his conduct,
in his face or his hands, without recourse to any ‘inner’ experience
of suﬀering or anger, and because grief and anger are variations of
belonging to the world, undivided between the body and consciousness, and equally applicable to the other’s conduct, visible in his phenomenal body, as in my own conduct as it is presented to me. But then,
the behaviour of another, and even his words, are not that other. The
grief and the anger of another have never quite the same signiﬁcance
for him as they have for me. For him these situations are lived through,
for me they are displayed. Or in so far as I can, by some friendly
gesture, become part of that grief or that anger, they still remain the
grief and anger of my friend Paul: Paul suﬀers because he has lost his
wife, or is angry because his watch has been stolen, whereas I suﬀer
because Paul is grieved, or I am angry because he is angry, and our
situations cannot be superimposed on each other. If, moreover, we
undertake some project in common, this common project is not one
single project, it does not appear in the selfsame light to both of us, we
are not both equally enthusiastic about it, or at any rate not in quite the
same way, simply because Paul is Paul and I am myself. Although his
consciousness and mine, working through our respective situations,
may contrive to produce a common situation in which they can communcate, it is nevertheless from the subjectivity of each of us that each
one projects this ‘one and only’ world. The diﬃculties inherent in the
perception of others did not all stem from objective thought, nor do
they all dissolve with the discovery of behaviour, or rather objective
thought and the uniqueness of the cogito which ﬂows from it are not
ﬁctions, but ﬁrmly grounded phenomena of which we shall have to
seek the basis. The conﬂict between myself and the other does not
begin only when we try to think ourselves into the other does not vanish
if we reintegrate thought into non-positing consciousness and
unreﬂective living; it is already there if I try to live another’s experiences, for example in the blindness of sacriﬁce. I enter into a pact with
the other, having resolved to live in an interworld in which I accord as
much place to others as to myself. But this interworld is still a project of
mine, and it would be hypocritical to pretend that I seek the welfare of
another as if it were mine, since this very attachment to another’s interest
still has its source in me.

415

416 phenomenology of perception
In the absence of reciprocity there is no alter Ego, since the world of
the one then takes in completely that of the other, so that one feels
disinherited in favour of the other. This is what happens in the case of a
couple where there is more love felt on one side than on the other: one
throws himself, and his whole life, into his love, the other remains free,
ﬁnding in this love a merely contingent manner of living. The former
feels his being and substance ﬂowing away into that freedom which
confronts him, whole and unqualiﬁed. And even if the second partner,
through ﬁdelity to his vows or through generosity, tries to reciprocate
by reducing himself, or herself, to the status of a mere phenomenon in
the other’s world, and to see himself through the other’s eyes, he can
succeed only by an expansion of his own life, so that he denies by
necessity the equivalence of himself with the other that he is trying to
posit. Co-existence must in all cases be experienced on both sides. If
neither of us is a constituting consciousness at the moment when we
are about to communicate and discover a common world, the question
then is: who communicates, and for whom does this world exist? And
if someone does communicate with someone else, if the interworld is
not an inconceivable in-itself and must exist for both of us, then again
communication breaks down, and each of us operates in his own private world like two players playing on two chessboards a hundred
miles apart. But here the players can still make known their moves to
each other by telephone or correspondence, which means that they are
in fact participants in the same world. I, on the other hand, share no
common ground with another, for the positing of the other with his
world, and the positing of myself with mine are mutually exclusive.
Once the other is posited, once the other’s gaze ﬁxed upon me has, by
inserting me into his ﬁeld, stripped me of part of my being, it will
readily be understood that I can recover it only by establishing relations
with him, by bringing about his clear recognition of me, and that my
freedom requires the same freedom for others. But ﬁrst we need to
know how it has been possible for me to posit the other. In so far as I
am born into the world, and have a body and a natural world, I can ﬁnd
in that world other patterns of behaviour with which my own interweave, as we have explained above. But also in so far as I am born and
my existence is already at work and is aware that it is given to itself, it
always remains on the hither side of the acts in which it tries to become

other selves and the human world

engaged and which are for ever mere modalities of its own, and particular cases of its insurmountable generality. It is this ground of given
existence that the cogito establishes; every assertion, every commitment,
and even every negation and doubt takes its place in a ﬁeld open in
advance, and testiﬁes to a self contiguous with itself before those particular acts in which it loses contact with itself. This self, a witness to
any actual communication, and without which the latter would be
ignorant of itself, and would not, therefore, be communication at all,
would seem to preclude any solution of the problem of others. There is
here a solipsism rooted in living experience and quite insurmountable.
It is true that I do not feel that I am the constituting agent either of the
natural or of the cultural world: into each perception and into each
judgment I bring either sensory functions or cultural settings which
are not actually mine. Yet although I am outrun on all sides by my own
acts, and submerged in generality, the fact remains that I am the one by
whom they are experienced, and with my ﬁrst perception there was
launched an insatiable being who appropriates everything that he
meets, to whom nothing can be purely and simply given because he
has inherited his share of the world, and hence carries within him the
project of all possible being, because it has been once and for all
imprinted in his ﬁeld of experiences. The generality of the body will
never make it clear how the indeclinable I can estrange itself in favour
of another, since this generality is exactly compensated by the other
generality of my inalienable subjectivity. How should I ﬁnd elsewhere, in
my perceptual ﬁeld, such a presence of self to self? Are we to say that
the existence of the other is for me a simple fact? It is in any case a fact for
me, and it must necessarily be among my own possibilities, and understood or in some way experienced by me in order to be valid as a fact.
After this failure to set limits to solipsism from the outside, are we
then to try to outrun it inwardly? It is true that I can recognize only one
Ego, but as universal subject I cease to be a ﬁnite self, and become an
impartial spectator before whom the other and myself, each as an
empirical being, are on a footing of equality, without my enjoying any
particular privilege. Of the consciousness which I discover by reﬂection and before which everything is an object, it cannot be said that it is
myself: my self is arrayed before me like any other thing, and my
consciousness constitutes it and is not enclosed within it, so that it can

417

418 phenomenology of perception
without diﬃculty constitute other (my)selves. In God I can be conscious of others as of myself, and love others as myself. But the subjectivity that we have run up against does not admit of being called
God. If reﬂection reveals myself to me as an inﬁnite subject, we must
recognize, at least at the level of appearance, my ignorance of this self
which is even more myself than I. I knew it, the reply will be, because
I perceived both the other and myself, and because this perception is
possible only through him. But if I did already know it, then all books
of philosophy are useless. In fact, the truth needs to be revealed. It was,
therefore, this ﬁnite and ignorant self which recognized God in itself,
while God, beyond phenomena, thought about himself since the
beginning of time. It is through this shadow that unavailing light manages to be shed on at least something, and thus it is ultimately impossible to bring the shadow into the light; I can never recognize myself as
God without necessarily denying what I am trying in fact to assert. I
might love others as myself in God, but even then my love of God
would have to come not from me, and would have to be truly, as
Spinoza said, the love which God has for himself through me. So that
ﬁnally nowhere would there be love of others or indeed others, but one
single self-love linked to itself beyond our own lives, and nowise relevant, indeed inaccessible, to us. The act of reﬂection and love leading to
God places the God sought outside the realm of possibility.
We are thus brought back to solipsism, and the problem now
appears in all its diﬃculty. I am not God, but merely lay claim to
divinity. I escape from every involvement and transcend others in so far
as every situation and every other person must be experienced by me in
order to exist in my eyes. And yet other people have for me at least an
initial meaning. As with the gods of polytheism, I have to reckon with
other gods, or again, as with Aristotle’s God, I polarize a world which I
do not create. Consciousnesses present themselves with the absurdity
of a multiple solipsism, such is the situation which has to be understood. Since we live through this situation, there must be some way of
making it explicit. Solitude and communication cannot be the two
horns of a dilemma, but two ‘moments’ of one phenomenon, since in
fact other people do exist for me. We must say of experience of others
what we have said elsewhere about reﬂection: that its object cannot
escape it entirely, since we have a notion of the object only through

other selves and the human world

that experience. Reﬂection must in some way present the unreﬂected,
otherwise we should have nothing to set over against it, and it would
not become a problem for us. Similarly my experience must in some
way present me with other people, since otherwise I should have no
occasion to speak of solitude, and could not begin to pronounce other
people inaccessible. What is given and initially true, is a reﬂection open
to the unreﬂective, the reﬂective assumption of the unreﬂective—and
similarly there is given the tension of my experience towards another
whose existence on the horizon of my life is beyond doubt, even when
my knowledge of him is imperfect. There is more than a vague analogy
between the two problems, for in both cases it is a matter of ﬁnding
out how to steal a march on myself and experience the unreﬂective as
such. How, then, can I who perceive, and who, ipso facto, assert myself as
universal subject, perceive another who immediately deprives me of
this universality? The central phenomenon, at the root of both my
subjectivity and my transcendence towards others, consists in my being
given to myself. I am given, that is, I ﬁnd myself already situated and
involved in a physical and social world—I am given to myself, which
means that this situation is never hidden from me, it is never round
about me as an alien necessity, and I am never in eﬀect enclosed in it
like an object in a box. My freedom, the fundamental power which I
enjoy of being the subject of all my experiences, is not distinct from
my insertion into the world. It is a fate for me to be free, to be unable to
reduce myself to anything that I experience, to maintain in relation to
any factual situation a faculty of withdrawal, and this fate was sealed
the moment my transcendental ﬁeld was thrown open, when I was
born as vision and knowledge, when I was thrown into the world.
Contrary to the social world I can always use my nature as a sensory
being, close my eyes, stop up my ears, live as a stranger in society, treat
others, ceremonies and institutions as mere arrangements of colour
and light, and strip them of all their human signiﬁcance. Contrary to
the natural world I can always have recourse to my thinking nature and
entertain doubts about each perception taken on its own. The truth of
solipsism is there. Every experience will always appear to me as a
particular instance which does not exhaust the generality of my being,
and I have always, as Malebranche said, movement left wherewith to go
further. But I can ﬂy from being only into being; for example, I escape

419

420 phenomenology of perception
from society into nature, or from the real world into an imaginary one
made of the broken fragments of reality. The physical and social world
always functions as a stimulus to my reactions, whether these be positive or negative. I call such and such a perception into question only in
the name of a truer one capable of correcting it; in so far as I can deny
each thing, it is always by asserting that there is something in general,
and this is why we say that thought is a thinking nature, an assertion of
being over and above the negation of beings. I can evolve a solipsist
philosophy but, in doing so, I assume the existence of a community of
men endowed with speech, and I address myself to it. Even the
‘indeﬁnite refusal to be anything at all’5 assumes something which is
refused and in relation to which the subject holds himself apart. I must
choose between others and myself, it is said. But we choose one against
the other, and thus assert both. The other transforms me into an object
and denies me, I transform him into an object and deny him, it is
asserted. In fact the other’s gaze transforms me into an object, and
mine him, only if both of us withdraw into the core of our thinking
nature, if we both make ourselves into an inhuman gaze, if each of us
feels his actions to be not taken up and understood, but observed as if
they were an insect’s. This is what happens, for instance, when I fall
under the gaze of a stranger. But even then, the objectiﬁcation of each
by the other’s gaze is felt as unbearable only because it takes the place
of possible communication. A dog’s gaze directed towards me causes
me no embarrassment. The refusal to communicate, however, is still a
form of communication. Multifarious freedom, my thinking nature,
the inalienable ground, existence without qualiﬁcation, which in me
and in others mark the bounds of sympathy, do call a halt to communication, but do not abolish it. If I am dealing with a stranger who has as
yet not uttered a word, I may well believe that he is an inhabitant of
another world in which my own thoughts and actions are unworthy of
a place. But let him utter a word, or even make a gesture of impatience,
and already he ceases to transcend me: that, then, is his voice, those are
his thoughts and that is the realm that I thought inaccessible. Each
existence ﬁnally transcends the others only when it remains inactive
and rests upon its natural diﬀerence. Even that universal meditation

other selves and the human world

which cuts the philosopher oﬀ from his nation, his friendships, his
prejudices, his empirical being, the world in short, and which seems to
leave him in complete isolation, is in reality an act, the spoken word,
and consequently dialogue. Solipsism would be strictly true only of
someone who managed to be tacitly aware of his existence without
being or doing anything, which is impossible, since existing is being in
and of the world. The philosopher cannot fail to draw others with him
into his reﬂective retreat, because in the uncertainty of the world, he
has for ever learned to treat them as consorts, and because all his knowledge is built on this datum of opinion. Transcendental subjectivity is a
revealed subjectivity, revealed to itself and to others, and is for that
reason an intersubjectivity. As soon as existence collects itself together
and commits itself in some line of conduct, it falls beneath perception.
Like every other perception, this one asserts more things than it grasps:
when I say that I see the ash-tray over there, I suppose as completed an
unfolding of experience which could go on ad inﬁnitum, and I commit a
whole perceptual future. Similarly, when I say that I know and like
someone, I aim, beyond his qualities, at an inexhaustible ground
which may one day shatter the image that I have formed of him. This is
the price for there being things and ‘other people’ for us, not as the
result of some illusion, but as the result of a violent act which is
perception itself.
We must therefore rediscover, after the natural world, the social
world, not as an object or sum of objects, but as a permanent ﬁeld or
dimension of existence: I may well turn away from it, but not cease to
be situated relatively to it. Our relationship to the social is, like our
relationship to the world, deeper than any express perception or any
judgement. It is as false to place ourselves in society as an object among
other objects, as it is to place society within ourselves as an object of
thought, and in both cases the mistake lies in treating the social as an
object. We must return to the social with which we are in contact by
the mere fact of existing, and which we carry about inseparably with us
before any objectiﬁcation. Objective and scientiﬁc consciousness of the
past and of civilizations would be impossible had I not, through the
intermediary of my society, my cultural world and their horizons, at
least a possible communication with them, and if the place of the
Athenian Republic or the Roman Empire were not somewhere marked

421

422 phenomenology of perception
out on the borders of my own history, and if they were not there as so
many individuals to be known, indeterminate but pre-existing, and if I
did not ﬁnd in my own life the basic structures of history. The social is
already there when we come to know or judge it. An individualistic or
sociological philosophy is a certain perception of co-existence systematized and made explicit. Prior to the process of becoming aware, the
social exists obscurely and as a summons. At the end of Notre Patrie
Péguy ﬁnds once again a buried voice which had never ceased to speak,
much as we realize on waking that objects have not, during the night,
ceased to be, or that someone has been knocking for some time at our
door. Despite cultural, moral, occupational and ideological diﬀerences,
the Russian peasants of 1917 joined the workers of Petrograd and
Moscow in the struggle, because they felt that they shared the same
fate; class was experienced in concrete terms before becoming the
object of a deliberate volition. Primarily the social does not exist as a
third person object. It is the mistake of the investigator, the ‘great man’
and the historian to try to treat it as an object. Fabrice would have liked
to see the Battle of Waterloo as one sees a landscape, but found nothing
but confused episodes. Does the Emperor really see it on his map? It
reduces itself in his eyes to a general plan by no means free from gaps;
why is this regiment not making headway; why don’t the reserves
come up? The historian who is not engaged in the battle and who sees
it from all angles, who brings together a mass of evidence, and who
knows what the result was, thinks he has grasped it in its essential
truth. But what he gives us is no more than a representation; he does
not bring before us the battle itself since the issue was, at the time,
contingent, and is no longer so when the historian recounts it, since
the deeper causes of defeat and the fortuitous incidents which brought
them into play were, in that singular event called Waterloo, equally
determining factors, and since the historian assigns to the said singular
event its place in the general process of decline of the Empire. The true
Waterloo resides neither in what Fabrice, nor the Emperor, nor the
historian sees, it is not a determinable object, it is what comes about on
the fringes of all perspectives, and on which they are all erected.6 The
6

It would therefore seem that history should be written in the present tense. It is what
Jules Romains, for example, did in Verdun. Naturally, from the fact that objective thought

other selves and the human world

historian and the philosopher are in search of an objective deﬁnition of
class or nation: is the nation based on common language or on conceptions of life; is class based on income statistics or on its place in the
process of production? It is well known that none of these criteria
enables us to decide whether an individual belongs to a nation or a
class. In all revolutions there are members of the privileged class who
make common cause with the revolutionaries, and members of the
oppressed class who remain faithful to the privileged. And every nation
has its traitors. This is because the nation and class are neither versions
of fate which hold the individual in subjection from the outside nor
values which he posits from within. They are modes of co-existence
which are a call upon him. Under conditions of calm, the nation and
the class are there as stimuli to which I respond only absent-mindedly
or confusedly; they are merely latent. A revolutionary situation, or one
of national danger, transforms those pre-conscious relationships with
class and nation, hitherto merely lived through, into the deﬁnite taking
of a stand; the tacit commitment becomes explicit. But it appears to
itself as anterior to decision.
The problem of the existential modality of the social is here at one
with all problems of transcendence. Whether we are concerned with
my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is
always how I can be open to phenomena which transcend me, and
which nevertheless exist only to the extent that I take them up and live
them; how the presence to myself (Urpräsenz) which establishes my own limits and
conditions every alien presence is at the same time depresentation (Entgegenwärtigung)7
and throws me outside myself. Both idealism and realism, the former by
making the external world immanent in me, the latter by subjecting
is incapable of retailing down to the last detail a present historical situation, we must not
conclude that we should live through our history with our eyes closed, as if it were an
individual adventure, reject every attempt to put it into perspective, and throw ourselves
into action with no guiding principle. Fabrice misses Waterloo, but the reporter is
already nearer to the event, for the spirit of adventure leads us astray even more than
objective thought. There is a way of thinking, in contact with the event, which seeks its
concrete structure. A revolution which is really moving with the march of history can be
thought as well as lived.

me to a causal action, falsify the motivational relations existing
between the external and internal worlds, and make this relationship
unintelligible. Our individual past, for example, cannot be given to us
either on the one hand by the actual survival of states of consciousness
or paths traced in the brain, or on the other by a consciousness of the
past which constitutes it and immediately arrives at it: in either case we
should lack any sense of the past, for the past would, strictly speaking,
be present. If anything of the past is to exist for us, it can be only in an
ambiguous presence, anterior to any express evocation, like a ﬁeld
upon which we have an opening. It must exist for us even though we
may not be thinking of it, and all our recollections must have their
substance in and be drawn from this opaque mass. Similarly, if the
world were to me merely a collection of things, and the thing merely a
collection of properties, I should have no certainties, but merely probabilities, no unchallengeable reality, but merely conditional truths. If
the past and the world exist, they must be theoretically immanent—
they can be only what I see behind and around me—and factually
transcendent—they exist in my life before appearing as objects of my
explicit acts. Similarly, moreover, my birth and death cannot be objects
of thought for me. Being established in my life, buttressed by my
thinking nature, fastened down in this transcendental ﬁeld which was
opened for me by my ﬁrst perception, and in which all absence is
merely the obverse of a presence, all silence a modality of the being of
sound, I enjoy a sort of ubiquity and theoretical eternity, I feel destined to move in a ﬂow of endless life, neither the beginning nor the
end of which I can experience in thought, since it is my living self
who think of them, and since thus my life always precedes and survives itself. Yet this same thinking nature which produces in me a
superabundance of being opens the world to me through a perspective, along with which there comes to me the feeling of my contingency, the dread of being outstripped, so that, although I do not
manage to encompass my death in thought, I nevertheless live in an
atmosphere of death in general, and there is a kind of essence of death
always on the horizon of my thinking. In short, just as the instant of my
death is a future to which I have not access, so I am necessarily destined
never to live through the presence of another to himself. And yet each
other person does exist for me as an unchallengeable style or setting of

other selves and the human world

co-existence, and my life has a social atmosphere just as it has a ﬂavour
of mortality.
We have discovered, with the natural and social worlds, the truly
transcendental, which is not the totality of constituting operations
whereby a transparent world, free from obscurity and impenetrable
solidity, is spread out before an impartial spectator, but that ambiguous
life in which the forms of transcendence have their Ursprung, and which,
through a fundamental contradiction, puts me in communication with
them, and on this basis makes knowledge possible.8 It will perhaps be
maintained that a philosophy cannot be centred round a contradiction,
and that all our descriptions, since they ultimately defy thought, are
quite meaningless. The objection would be valid if we were content to
lay bare, under the term phenomenon or phenomenal ﬁeld, a layer of
prelogical or magical experiences. For in that case we should have to
choose between believing the descriptions and abandoning thought, or
knowing what we are talking about and abandoning our descriptions.
These descriptions must become an opportunity for deﬁning a variety
of comprehension and reﬂection altogether more radical than objective
thought. To phenomenology understood as direct description needs to
be added a phenomenology of phenomenology. We must return to the
cogito, in search of a more fundamental Logos than that of objective
thought, one which endows the latter with its relative validity, and at the
same time assigns to it its place. At the level of being it will never be
intelligible that the subject should be both naturans and naturatus, inﬁnite
and ﬁnite. But if we rediscover time beneath the subject, and if we relate
to the paradox of time those of the body, the world the thing, and others,
we shall understand that beyond these there is nothing to understand.
Husserl in his last period concedes that all reﬂection should in the ﬁrst place return to
the description of the world of living experience (Lebenswelt). But he adds that, by means
of a second ‘reduction’, the structures of the world of experience must be reinstated in
the transcendental ﬂow of a universal constitution in which all the world’s obscurities
are elucidated. It is clear, however, that we are faced with a dilemma: either the constitution makes the world transparent, in which case it is not obvious why reﬂection needs to
pass through the world of experience, or else it retains something of that world, and
never rids it of its opacity. Husserl’s thought moves increasingly in this second direction,
despite many throwbacks to the logicist period—as is seen when he makes a problem of
rationality, when he allows signiﬁcances which are in the last resort ‘ﬂuid’ (Erfahrung und
Urteil, p. 428), when he bases knowledge on a basic δοξα.

Being-for-Itself and Beingin-the-World

1
THE COGITO
I am thinking of the Cartesian cogito, wanting to ﬁnish this work,
feeling the coolness of the paper under my hand, and perceiving the
trees of the boulevard through the window. My life is constantly
thrown headlong into transcendent things, and passes wholly outside
me. The cogito is either this thought which took shape three centuries
ago in the mind of Descartes, or the meaning of the books he has left
for us, or else an eternal truth which emerges from them, but in any
case is a cultural being of which it is true to say that my thought
strains towards it rather than that it embraces it, as my body, in a
familiar surrounding, ﬁnds its orientation and makes its way among
objects without my needing to have them expressly in mind. This
book, once begun, is not a certain set of ideas; it constitutes for me an
open situation, for which I could not possibly provide any complex
formula, and in which I struggle blindly on until, miraculously,
thoughts and words become organized by themselves. A fortiori the
sensible forms of being which lie around me, the paper under my
hand, the trees before my eyes, do not yield their secret to me, rather
is it that my consciousness takes ﬂight from itself and, in them, is
unaware of itself. Such is the initial situation that realism tries to
account for by asserting an actual transcendence and the existence in
itself of the world and ideas.

430 phenomenology of perception
There is, however, no question of justifying realism, and there is an
element of ﬁnal truth in the Cartesian return of things or ideas to the
self. The very experience of transcendent things is possible only provided that their project is borne, and discovered, within myself. When I
say that things are transcendent, this means that I do not possess them,
that I do not circumambulate them; they are transcendent to the extent
that I am ignorant of what they are, and blindly assert their bare existence. Now what meaning can there be in asserting the existence of one
knows not what? If there can be any truth at all in this assertion, it is in
so far as I catch a glimpse of the nature or essence to which it refers, in
so far, for instance, as my vision of the tree as a mute ek-stase into an
individual thing already envelops a certain thought about seeing and a
certain thought about the tree. It is, in short, in so far as I do not merely
encounter the tree, am not simply confronted with it, but discover in
this existent before me a certain nature, the notion of which I actively
evolve. In so far as I ﬁnd things round about me, this cannot be because
they are actually there, for, ex hypothesi, I can know nothing of this factual
existence. The fact that I am capable of recognizing it is attributable to
my actual contact with the thing, which awakens within me a primordial knowledge of all things, and to my ﬁnite and determinate perceptions’ being partial manifestations of a power of knowing which is
coextensive with the world and unfolds it in its full extent and depth. If
we imagine a space in itself with which the perceiving subject contrives to coincide, for example, if I imagine that my hand perceives the
distance between two points as it spans it, how could the angle formed
by my ﬁngers, and indicative of that distance, come to be judged,
unless it were so to speak measured out by the inner operation of
some power residing in neither object, a power which, ipso facto,
becomes able to know, or rather eﬀect, the relation existing between
them? If it be insisted that the ‘sensation in my thumb’ and that in my
ﬁrst ﬁnger are at any rate ‘signs’ of the distance, how could these
sensations come to have in themselves any means of signifying the
relationship between points in space, unless they were already situated
on a path running from one to the other, and unless this path in its
turn were not only traversed by my ﬁngers as they open, but also
‘aimed at’ by my thought pursuing its intelligible purpose? ‘How
could the mind know the signiﬁcance of a sign which it has not itself

the cogito

constituted as a sign?’1 For the picture of knowledge at which we
arrived in describing the subject situated in his world, we must, it
seems, substitute a second, according to which it constructs or constitutes this world itself, and this one is more authentic than the ﬁrst,
since the transactions between the subject and the things round about
it are possible only provided that the subject ﬁrst of all causes them to
exist for itself, actually arranges them round about itself, and extracts
them from its own core. The same applies with greater force in acts of
spontaneous thought. The Cartesian cogito, which is the theme of my
reﬂection, is always beyond what I bring to mind at the moment. It has
a horizon of signiﬁcance made up of a great number of thoughts
which occurred to me as I was reading Descartes and which are not
now present, along with others which I feel stirring within me, which
I might have, but never have developed. But the fact that it is enough to
utter these three syllables in my presence for me to be immediately
directed towards a certain set of ideas, shows that in some way all
possible developments and clariﬁcations are at once present to me.
‘Whoever tries to limit the spiritual light to what is at present before
the mind always runs up against the Socratic problem. “How will you
set about looking for that thing, the nature of which is totally
unknown to you? Which, among the things you do not know, is the
one which you propose to look for? And if by chance you should
stumble upon it, how will you know that it is indeed that thing, since
you are in ignorance of it?” (Meno, 80D.)2 A thought really transcended
by its objects would ﬁnd them proliferating in its path without ever
being able to grasp their relationships to each other, or ﬁnding its way
through to their truth. It is I who reconstitute the historical cogito, I
who read Descartes’ text, I who recognize in it an undying truth, so
that ﬁnally the Cartesian cogito acquires its signiﬁcance only through
my own cogito, and I should have no thought of it, had I not within
myself all that is needed to invent it. It is I who assign to my thought
the objective of resuming the action of the cogito, and I who constantly
verify my thought’s orientation towards this objective, therefore my
thought must forestall itself in the pursuit of this aim, and must

already have found what it seeks, otherwise it would not seek it. We
must deﬁne thought in terms of that strange power which it possesses
of being ahead of itself, of launching itself and being at home everywhere, in a word, in terms of its autonomy. Unless thought itself had
put into things what it subsequently ﬁnds in them, it would have no
hold upon things, would not think of them, and would be an ‘illusion
of thought’.3 A sensible perception or a piece of reasoning cannot be
facts which come about in me and of which I take note. When I
consider them after the event, they are dispersed and distributed each
to its due place. But all this is merely what is left in the wake of
reasoning and perception which, seen contemporaneously, must
necessarily, on pain of ceasing to hang together, take in simultaneously
everything necessary to their realization, and consequently be present
to themselves with no intervening distance, in one indivisible intention. All thought of something is at the same time self-consciousness,
failing which it could have no object. At the root of all our experiences
and all our reﬂections, we ﬁnd, then, a being which immediately
recognizes itself, because it is its knowledge both of itself and of all
things, and which knows its own existence, not by observation and as
a given fact, nor by inference from any idea of itself, but through
direct contact with that existence. Self-consciousness is the very being
of mind in action. The act whereby I am conscious of something must
itself be apprehended at the very moment at which it is carried out,
otherwise it would collapse. Therefore it is inconceivable that it should
be triggered oﬀ or brought about by anything whatsoever; it must be
causa sui.4 To revert with Descartes from things to thought about things
is to take one of two courses: it is either to reduce experience to a
collection of psychological events, of which the I is merely the overall
name or the hypothetical cause, in which case it is not clear how my
existence is more certain than that of any thing, since it is no longer
immediate, save at a ﬂeeting instant; or else it is to recognize as
anterior to events a ﬁeld and a system of thoughts which is subject
neither to time nor to any other limitation, a mode of existence owing
nothing to the event and which is existence as consciousness, a

the cogito

spiritual act which grasps at a distance and compresses into itself everything at which it aims, an ‘I think’ which is, by itself and without any
adjunct, an ‘I am’.5 ‘The Cartesian doctrine of the cogito was therefore
bound to lead logically to the assertion of the timelessness of mind,
and to the acceptance of a consciousness of the eternal: experimur nos
aeternos esse.’6 Accordingly eternity, understood as the power to embrace
and anticipate temporal developments in a single intention, becomes
the very deﬁnition of subjectivity.7
Before questioning this interpretation of the cogito in terms of eternity, let us carefully observe what follows from it, as this will show the
need of some rectiﬁcation. If the cogito reveals to me a new mode of
existence owing nothing to time, and if I discover myself as the universal constituent of all being accessible to me, and as a transcendental
ﬁeld with no hidden corners and no outside, it is not enough to say
that my mind, ‘when it is a question of the form of all the objects of
sense . . . is the God of Spinoza’,8 for the distinction between form and
matter can no longer be given any ultimate value, therefore it is not
clear how the mind, reﬂecting on itself, could in the last analysis ﬁnd
any meaning in the notion of receptivity, or think of itself in any valid
way as undergoing modiﬁcation: for if it is the mind itself which
thinks of itself as aﬀected, it does not think of itself thus, since it aﬃrms
its activity afresh simultaneously with appearing to restrict it: in so far,
on the other hand, as it is the mind which places itself in the world, it is
not there, and the self-positing is an illusion. It must then be said, with
no qualiﬁcation, that my mind is God. How can M. Lachièze-Rey, for
example, have avoided this consequence? ‘If, having suspended thinking, I resume it again, I return to life, I reconstitute, in its indivisibility,
and by putting myself back at the source whence it ﬂows, the movement which I carry on. . . . Thus, whenever he thinks, the subject
makes himself his point of support, and takes his place, beyond and
behind his various representations, in that unity which, being the principle of all recognition, is not there to be recognized, and he becomes

once more the absolute because that is what he eternally is.’9 But how
could there be several absolutes? How in the ﬁrst place could I ever
recognize other (my)selves? If the sole experience of the subject is the
one which I gain by coinciding with it, if the mind, by deﬁnition,
eludes ‘the outside spectator’ and can be recognized only from within,
my cogito is necessarily unique, and cannot be ‘shared in’ by another.
Perhaps we can say that it is ‘transferable’ to others.10 But then how
could such a transfer ever be brought about? What spectacle can ever
validly induce me to posit outside myself that mode of existence the
whole signiﬁcance of which demands that it be grasped from within?
Unless I learn within myself to recognize the junction of the for itself
and the in itself, none of those mechanisms called other bodies will ever
be able to come to life; unless I have an exterior others have no interior.
The plurality of consciousness is impossible if I have an absolute consciousness of myself. Behind the absolute of my thought, it is even
impossible to conjecture a divine absolute. If it is perfect, the contact of
my thought with itself seals me within myself, and prevents me from
ever feeling that anything eludes my grasp; there is no opening, no
‘aspiration’11 towards an Other for this self of mine, which constructs
the totality of being and its own presence in the world, which is
deﬁned in terms of ‘self-possession’,12 and which never ﬁnds anything
outside itself but what it has put there. This hermetically sealed self is
no longer a ﬁnite self. ‘There is . . . a consciousness of the universe only
through the previous consciousness of organization in the active sense
of the word, and consequently, in the last analysis, only through an
inner communion with the very working of godhead.’13 It is ultimately
with God that the cogito brings me into coincidence. While the intelligible and identiﬁable structure of my experience, when recognized by
me in the cogito, draws me out of the event and establishes me in
eternity, it frees me simultaneously from all limiting attributes and, in
fact, from that fundamental event which is my private existence. Hence
the same reasoning which necessarily leads from the event to the act,

from thoughts to the I, equally necessarily leads from the multiplicity
of I’s to one sole constituting consciousness, and prevents me from
entertaining any vain hope of salvaging the ﬁniteness of the subject by
deﬁning it as a ‘monad’.14 The constituting consciousness is necessarily
unique and universal. If we try to maintain that what it constitutes in
each one of us is merely a microcosm, if we keep, for the cogito, the
meaning of ‘existential experience’,15 and if it reveals to me, not the
absolute transparency of thought wholly in possession of itself, but
the blind act by which I take up my destiny as a thinking nature and
follow it out, then we are introducing another philosophy, which does
not take us out of time. What is brought home to us here is the need to
ﬁnd a middle course between eternity and the atomistic time of
empiricism, in order to resume the interpretation of the cogito and of
time. We have seen once and for all that our relations with things
cannot be eternal ones, nor our consciousness of ourself the mere
recording of psychic events. We perceive a world only provided that,
before being facts of which we take cognizance, that world and that
perception are thoughts of our own. What remains to be understood
precisely is the way the world comes to belong to the subject and the
subject to himself, which is that cogitatio which makes experience possible; our hold on things and on our ‘states of consciousness’. We shall
see that this does not leave the event and time out of account, but that it
is indeed the fundamental mode of the event and Geschichte, from which
objective and impersonal events are derived forms, and ﬁnally that
any recourse we have to eternity is necessitated solely by an objective
conception of time.
There can therefore be no doubt at all that I think. I am not sure that
there is over there an ash-tray or a pipe, but I am sure that I think I see
an ash-tray or a pipe. Now is it is fact as easy as is generally thought to
dissociate these two assertions and hold, independently of any judgement concerning the thing seen, the evident certainty of my ‘thought
about seeing’? On the contrary, it is impossible. Perception is precisely
that kind of act in which there can be no question of setting the act
itself apart from the end to which it is directed. Perception and the

435

436 phenomenology of perception
perceived necessarily have the same existential modality, since perception is inseparable from the consciousness which it has, or rather is, of
reaching the thing itself. Any contention that the perception is indubitable, whereas the thing perceived is not, must be ruled out. If I see an
ash-tray, in the full sense of the word see, there must be an ash-tray there, and
I cannot forego this assertion. To see is to see something. To see red, is
to see red actively in existence. Vision can be reduced to the mere
presumption of seeing only if it is represented as the contemplation of
a shifting and anchorless quale. But if, as we have shown above, the very
quality itself, in its speciﬁc texture, is the suggestion of a certain way of
existing put to us, and responded to by us, in so far as we have sensory
ﬁelds; and if the perception of a colour, endowed with a deﬁnite structure (in the way of surface colour or area of colour), at a place or
distance away either deﬁnite or vague, presupposes our opening on to a
reality or a world, how can we possibly dissociate the certainty of our
perceptual existence from that of its external counterpart? It is of the
essence of my vision to refer not only to an alleged visible entity, but
also to a being actually seen. Similarly, if I feel doubts about the presence of the thing, this doubt attaches to vision itself, and if there is no
red or blue there, I say that I have not really seen these colours, and
concede that at no time has there been created that parity between my
visual intentions and the visible which constitutes the genuine act of
seeing. We are therefore faced with a choice: either I enjoy no certainty
with regard to things themselves, in which case neither can I be certain
about my own perception, taken as a mere thought, since, taken even in
this way, it involves the assertion of a thing. Or else I grasp my thought
with certainty, which involves the simultaneous assumption of the
existence towards which it is projected. When Descartes tells us that
the existence of visible things is doubtful, but that our vision, when
considered as a mere thought of seeing is not in doubt, he takes up an
untenable position. For thought about seeing can have two meanings. It
can in the ﬁrst place be understood in the restricted sense of alleged
vision, or ‘the impression of seeing’, in which case it oﬀers only the
certainty of a possibility or a probability, and the ‘thought of seeing’
implies that we have had, in certain cases, the experience of genuine or
actual vision to which the idea of seeing bears a resemblance and in
which the certainty of the thing was, on those occasions, involved. The

the cogito

certainty of a possibility is no more than the possibility of a certainty,
the thought of seeing is no more than seeing mentally, and we could
not have any such thought unless we had on other occasions really
seen. Now we may understand ‘thought about seeing’ as the consciousness we have of our constituting power. Whatever be the case
with our empirical perceptions, which may be true or false, these
perceptions are possible only if they are inhabited by a mind able to
recognize, identify and sustain before us their intentional object. But if
this constituting power is not a myth, if perception is really the mere
extension of an inner dynamic power with which I can coincide, my
certainty concerning the transcendental premises of the world must
extend to the world itself, and, my vision being in its entirety thought
about seeing, then the thing seen is in itself what I think about it, so
that transcendental idealism becomes absolute realism. It would be
contradictory to assert16 both that the world is constituted by me and
that, out of this constitutive operation, I can grasp no more than the
outline and the essential structures; I must see the existing world
appear at the end of the constituting process, and not only the world as
an idea, otherwise I shall have no more than an abstract construction,
and not a concrete consciousness, of the world. Thus, in whatever sense
we take ‘thought about seeing’, it is certain only so long as actual sight
is equally so. When Descartes tells us that sensation reduced to itself is
always true, and that error creeps in through the transcendent interpretation of it that judgement provides, he makes an unreal distinction:
it is no less diﬃcult for me to know whether or not I have felt something than it is to know whether there is really something there, for the
victim of hysteria feels yet does not know what it is that he feels, as he
perceives external objects without being aware of that perception.
When, on the other hand, I am sure of having felt, the certainty of
some external thing is involved in the very way in which the sensation
is articulated and unfolded before me: it is a pain in the leg, or it is red,
16

As Husserl, for example, does when he concedes that any transcendental reduction is at
the same time an eidetic one. The necessity of proceeding by essences, and the stubborn
opacity of existences, cannot be taken for granted as facts, but contribute to determining
the signiﬁcance of the cogito and of ultimate subjectivity. I am not a constituting thought,
and my ‘I think’ is not an ‘I am’, unless by thought I can equal the world’s concrete
richness, and re-absorb facticity into it.

437

438 phenomenology of perception
and this may be an opaque red on one plane, or a reddish threedimensional atmosphere. The ‘interpretation’ of my sensations which I
give must necessarily be motivated, and be so only in terms of the
structure of those sensations, so that it can be said with equal validity
either that there is no transcendent interpretation and no judgement
which does not spring from the very conﬁguration of the
phenomena—or that there is no sphere of immanence, no realm in
which my consciousness is fully at home and secure against all risk of
error. The acts of the I are of such a nature that they outstrip themselves
leaving no interiority of consciousness. Consciousness is transcendence
through and through, not transcendence undergone—we have already
said that such a transcendence would bring consciousness to a stop—
but active transcendence. The consciousness I have of seeing or feeling
is no passive noting of some psychic event hermetically sealed upon
itself, an event leaving me in doubt about the reality of the thing seen
or felt. Nor is it the activation of some constituting power superlatively
and eternally inclusive of every possible sight or sensation, and linking
up with the object without ever having to be drawn away from itself. It
is the actual eﬀecting of vision. I reassure myself that I see by seeing
this or that, or at least by bringing to life around me a visual surrounding, a visible world which is ultimately vouched for only by the sight of
a particular thing. Vision is an action, not, that is, an eternal operation
(which is a contradiction in terms) but an operation which fulﬁls more
than it promises, which constantly outruns its premises and is inwardly
prepared only by my primordial opening upon a ﬁeld of transcendence, that is, once again, by an ek-stase. Sight is achieved and fulﬁls itself
in the thing seen. It is of its essence to take a hold upon itself, and
indeed if it did not do so it would not be the sight of anything, but
it is none the less of its essence to take a hold upon itself in a kind of
ambiguous and obscure way, since it is not in possession of itself
and indeed escapes from itself into the thing seen. What I discover
and recognize through the cogito is not psychological immanence, the
inherence of all phenomena in ‘private states of consciousness’, the
blind contact of sensation with itself. It is not even transcendental
immanence, the belonging of all phenomena to a constituting consciousness, the possession of clear thought by itself. It is the deepseated momentum of transcendence which is my very being, the

the cogito

simultaneous contact with my own being and with the world’s
being.
And yet is not the case of perception a special one? It throws me
open to a world, but can do so only by outrunning both me and itself.
Thus the perceptual ‘synthesis’ has to be incomplete; it cannot present
me with a ‘reality’ otherwise than by running the risk of error. It is
absolutely necessarily the case that the thing, if it is to be a thing,
should have sides of itself hidden from me, which is why the distinction between appearance and reality straightway has its place in the
perceptual ‘synthesis’. It would seem, on the other hand, that consciousness comes back into its rights and into full possession of itself, if
I consider my awareness of ‘psychic facts’. For example, love and will
are inner operations; they forge their own objects, and it is clear that in
doing so they may be sidetracked from reality and, in that sense, mislead us; but it seems impossible that they should mislead us about
themselves. From the moment I feel love, joy or sadness, it is the case
that I love, that I am joyful or sad, even when the object does not in fact
(that is, for others or for myself at other times) have the value that I
now attribute to it. Appearance is, within me, reality, and the being of
consciousness consists in appearing to itself. What is willing, if it is not
being conscious of an object as valid (or as valid precisely in so far as it
is invalid, in the case of perverse will), and what is loving other than
being conscious of an object as lovable? And since the consciousness of
an object necessarily involves a knowledge of itself, without which it
would escape from itself and fail even to grasp its object, to will and to
know that one wills, to love and know one loves are one and the same
act; love is consciousness of loving, will is consciousness of willing. A
love or a will unaware of itself would be an unloving love, or an
unwilling will, as an unconscious thought would be an unthinking
one. Will or love would seem to be the same whether their object be
artiﬁcial or real and, considered independently of the object to which
they actually refer, they would appear to constitute a sphere of absolute
certainty in which truth cannot elude us. Everything is, then, truth
within consciousness. There can never be illusion other than with
regard to the external object. A feeling, considered in itself, is always
true once it is felt. Let us, however, look at the matter more closely.
It is, in the ﬁrst place, quite clear that we are able to discriminate,

439

440 phenomenology of perception
within ourselves, between ‘true’ and ‘false’ feelings, that everything
felt by us as within ourselves is not ipso facto placed on a single footing
of existence, or true in the same way, and that there are degrees of
reality within us as there are, outside of us, ‘reﬂections’, ‘phantoms’
and ‘things’. Besides true love, there is false or illusory love. This last
case must be distinguished from misinterpretations, and those errors in
which I have deceitfully given the name of love to emotions unworthy
of it. For in such cases there was never even a semblance of love, and
never for a moment did I believe that my life was committed to that
feeling. I conspired with myself to avoid asking the question in order to
avoid receiving the reply which was already known to me; my ‘love’making was an attempt to do what was expected of me, or merely
deception. In mistaken or illusory love, on the other hand, I was willingly united to the loved one, she was for a time truly the vehicle of my
relationships with the world. When I told her that I loved her, I was not
‘interpreting’, for my life was in truth committed to a form which, like
a melody, demanded to be carried on. It is true that, following upon
disillusionment (the revelation of my illusion about myself), and when I
try to understand what has happened to me, I shall ﬁnd beneath this
supposed love something other than love: the likeness of the ‘loved’
woman to another, or boredom, or force of habit, or a community of
interests or of convictions, and it is just this which will justify me in
talking about illusion. I loved only qualities (that smile that is so like
another smile, that beauty which asserts itself like a fact, that youthfulness of gesture and behaviour) and not the individual manner of being
which is that person herself. And, correspondingly, I was not myself
wholly in thrall, for areas of my past and future life escaped the invasion, and I maintained within me corners set aside for other things. In
that case, it will be objected, I was either unaware of this, in which case
it is not a question of illusory love, but of a true love which is dying—
or else I did know, in which case there was never any love at all, even
‘mistaken’. But neither is the case. It cannot be said that this love, while
it lasted, was indistinguishable from true love, and that it became ‘mistaken love’ when I repudiated it. Nor can it be said that a mystical crisis
at ﬁfteen is without signiﬁcance, and that it becomes, when independently evaluated in later life, an incident of puberty or the ﬁrst signs of a
religious vocation. Even if I reconstruct my whole life on the basis of

the cogito

some incident of puberty, that incident does not lose its contingent
character, so that it is my whole life which is ‘mistaken’. In the mystical
crisis itself as I experienced it, there must be discoverable in it some
characteristic which distinguishes vocation from incident: in the ﬁrst
case the mystical attitude insinuates itself into my basic relationship to
the world and other people; in the second case, it is within the subject
as an impersonal form of behaviour, devoid of inner necessity:
‘puberty’. In the same way, true love summons all the subject’s
resources and concerns him in his entire being, whereas mistaken love
touches on only one persona: ‘the man of forty’ in the case of late love,
‘the traveller’ in the case of exotic appeal, ‘the widower’ if the misguided love is sustained by a memory, ‘the child’ where the mother is
recalled. True love ends when I change, or when the object of aﬀection
changes; misguided love is revealed as such when I return to my own
self. The diﬀerence is intrinsic. But as it concerns the place of feeling in
my total being-in-the-world, and as mistaken love is bound up with
the person I believe I am at the time I feel it, and also as, in order to
discern its mistaken nature I require a knowledge of myself which I can
gain only through disillusionment, ambiguity remains, which is why
illusion is possible.
Let us return to the example of the hysterical subject. It is easy to
treat him as a dissembler, but it is ﬁrst of all himself whom he deceives,
and this instability once more poses the problem we are trying to
dispose of; how can the victim of hysteria not feel what he feels, and
feel what he does not feel? He does not feign pain, sadness or anger, yet
his ﬁts of ‘pain’, ‘sadness’ or ‘rage’ are distinguishable from ‘real’ cases
of these aﬄictions, because he is not wholly given over to them: at his
core there is left a zone of tranquillity. Illusory or imaginary feelings
are genuinely experienced, but experienced, so to speak, on the outer
fringes of ourselves.17 Children and many grown people are under the
sway of ‘situational values’, which conceal from them their actual
feelings—they are pleased because they have been given a present, sad
because they are at a funeral, gay or sad according to the countryside
around them, and, on the hither side of any such emotions, indiﬀerent and neutral. ‘We experience the feeling itself keenly, but
17

441

442 phenomenology of perception
inauthentically. It is, as it were, the shadow of an authentic sentiment.’
Our natural attitude is not to experience our own feelings or to adhere
to our own pleasures, but to live in accordance with the emotional
categories of the environment. ‘The girl who is loved does not project
her emotions like an Isolde or a Juliet, but feels the feelings of these
poetic phantoms and infuses them into her own life. It is at a later date,
perhaps, that a personal and authentic feeling breaks the web of her
sentimental phantasies.’18 But until this feeling makes its appearance,
the girl has no means of discovering the illusory and literary element in
her love. It is the truth of her future feelings which is destined to reveal
the misguideness of her present ones, which are genuinely experienced. The girl ‘loses her reality’19 in them as does the actor in the part
he plays, so that we are faced, not with representations or ideas which
give rise to real emotions, but artiﬁcial emotions and imaginary sentiments. Thus we are not perpetually in possession of ourselves in our
whole reality, and we are justiﬁed in speaking of an inner perception,
of an inward sense, an ‘analyser’ working from us to ourselves which,
ceaselessly, goes some, but not all, the way in providing knowledge of
our life and our being. What remains on the hither side of inner perception and makes no impression on the inward sense is not an
unconscious. ‘My life’, my ‘total being’ are not dubious constructs, like
the ‘deep-seated self ’ of Bergson, but phenomena which are indubitably revealed to reﬂection. It is simply a question of what we are doing. I
make the discovery that I am in love. It may be that none of those facts,
which I now recognize as proof of my love, passed unnoticed by me;
neither the quickened drive of my present towards my future, nor that
emotion which left me speechless, nor my impatience for the arrival of
the day we were to meet. Nevertheless I had not seen the thing as a
whole, or, if I had, I did not realize that it was a matter of so important
a feeling, for I now discover that I can no longer conceive my life
without this love. Going back over the preceding days and months, I
am made aware that my thoughts and actions were polarized, I pick out
the course of a process of organization, a synthesis in the making. Yet it is
impossible to pretend that I always knew what I now know, and to see
18

the cogito

as existing, during the months which have elapsed, a self-knowledge
which I have only just come by. Quite generally, it is as impossible to
deny that I have much to learn about myself, as it is to posit ahead of
time, in the very heart of me, a knowledge of myself containing in
advance all that I am later destined to know of myself, after having read
books and had experiences at present unsuspected by me. The idea of a
form of consciousness which is transparent to itself, its existence being
identiﬁable with its awareness of existing, is not so very diﬀerent from
the notion of the unconscious; in both cases we have the same retrospective illusion, since there is, introduced into me as an explicit
object, everything that I am later to learn concerning myself. The love
which worked out its dialectic through me, and of which I have just
become aware, was not, from the start, a thing hidden in my
unconscious, nor was it an object before my consciousness, but the
impulse carrying me towards someone, the transmutation of my
thoughts and behaviour—I was not unaware of it since it was I who
endured the hours of boredom preceding a meeting, and who felt
elation when she approached—it was lived, not known, from start to
ﬁnish. The lover is not unlike the dreamer. The ‘latent content’ and the
‘sexual signiﬁcance’ of the dream are undoubtedly present to the
dreamer since it is he who dreams his dream. But, precisely because
sexuality is the general atmosphere of the dream, these elements are
not thematized as sexual, for want of any non-sexual background
against which they may stand out. When we ask ourselves whether or
not the dreamer is conscious of the sexual content of his dream, we are
really asking the wrong question. If sexuality, as we have explained
above, is indeed one of our ways of entering into a relationship with
the world, then whenever our meta-sexual being is overshadowed, as
happens in dreams, sexuality is everywhere and nowhere; it is, in the
nature of the case, ambiguous and cannot emerge clearly as itself. The
ﬁre which ﬁgures in the dream is not, for the dreamer, a way of disguising the sexual drive beneath an acceptable symbol, since it is only in
the waking state that it appears as a symbol; in the language of dreams,
ﬁre is the symbol of the sexual drive because the dreamer, being
removed from the physical world and the inﬂexible context of waking
life, uses imagery only in proportion as it has aﬀective value. The sexual
signiﬁcance of the dream is neither unconscious nor ‘conscious’,

443

444 phenomenology of perception
because the dream does not ‘signify’, as does waking life, by relating
one order of facts to another, and it is as great a mistake to see sexuality
as crystallized in ‘unconscious representations’ as it is to see lodged in
the depths of the dreamer a consciousness which calls it by its true
name. Similarly, for the lover whose experience it is, love is nameless; it
is not a thing capable of being circumscribed and designated, nor is it
the love spoken of in books and newspapers, because it is the way in
which he establishes his relations with the world; it is an existential
signiﬁcation. The criminal fails to see his crime, and the traitor his
betrayal for what they are, not because they exist deeply embedded
within him as unconscious representations or tendencies, but because
they are so many relatively closed worlds, so many situations. If we are
in a situation, we are surrounded and cannot be transparent to ourselves, so that our contact with ourselves is necessarily achieved only in
the sphere of ambiguity.
But have we not overshot our mark? If illusion is possible in consciousness on some occasions, will it not be possible on all occasions?
We said that there are imaginary sentiments to which we are committed suﬃciently for them to be experienced, but insuﬃciently for them
to be authentic. But are there any absolute commitments? Is it not of
the essence of commitment to leave unimpaired the autonomy of the
person who commits himself, in the sense that it is never complete, and
does it not therefore follow that we have no longer any means of
describing certain feelings as authentic? To deﬁne the subject in terms
of existence, that is to say, in terms of a process in which he transcends
himself, is surely by that very act to condemn him to illusion, since he
will never be able to be anything. Through refraining, in consciousness,
from deﬁning reality in terms of appearance, have we not severed the
links binding us to ourselves, and reduced consciousness to the status
of a mere appearance of some intangible reality? Are we not faced with
the dilemma of an absolute consciousness on the one hand and endless
doubt on the other? And have we not by our rejection of the ﬁrst
solution, made the cogito impossible? This objection brings us to the
crucial point. It is true neither that my existence is in full possession of
itself, nor that it is entirely estranged from itself, because it is action or
doing, and because action is, by deﬁnition, the violent transition from
what I have to what I aim to have, from what I am to what I intend to

the cogito

be. I can accomplish the cogito and have assurance of genuinely willing,
loving or believing, provided that in the ﬁrst place I actually do will,
love or believe, and thus accomplish my own existence. If this were not
so, an ineradicable doubt would spread over the world, and equally
over my own thoughts. I should be for ever wondering whether my
‘tastes’, ‘volitions’, ‘desires’ and ‘ventures’ were really mine, for they
would always seem artiﬁcial, unreal and unfulﬁlled. But then this
doubt, not being an actual doubt, could no longer even manage to
confer the absolute certainty of doubting.20 The only way out, and into
‘sincerity’, is by forestalling such scruples and taking a blind plunge
into ‘doing’. Hence it is not because I think I am that I am certain of my
existence: on the contrary the certainty I enjoy concerning my
thoughts stems from their genuine existence. My love, hatred and will
are not certain as mere thoughts about loving, hating and willing: on
the contrary the whole certainty of these thoughts is owed to that of
the acts of love, hatred or will of which I am quite sure because I perform
them. All inner perception is inadequate because I am not an object
that can be perceived, because I make my reality and ﬁnd myself only
in the act. ‘I doubt’: there is no way of silencing all doubt concerning
this proposition other than by actually doubting, involving oneself in
the experience of doubting, and thus bringing this doubt into existence as the certainty of doubting. To doubt is always to doubt something, even if one ‘doubts everything’. I am certain of doubting
precisely because I take this or that thing, or even every thing and my
own existence too, as doubtful. It is through my relation to ‘things’ that
I know myself; inner perception follows afterwards, and would not be
possible had I not already made contact with my doubt in its very
object. What has been said of external can equally be said of internal
perception: that it involves inﬁnity, that it is a never-ending synthesis
which, though always incomplete, is nevertheless self-aﬃrming. If I try
to verify my perception of the ash-tray, my task will be endless, for this
perception takes for granted more than I can know in an explicit way.

sincere, was there no end to it?’ S. de Beauvoir, L’Invitée, p. 232.

445

446 phenomenology of perception
Similarly, if I try to verify the reality of my doubt, I shall again be
launched into an inﬁnite regress, for I shall need to call into question
my thought about doubting, then the thought about that thought, and
so on. The certainty derives from the doubt itself as an act, and not
from these thoughts, just as the certainty of the thing and of the world
precedes any thetic knowledge of their properties. It is indeed true, as
has been said, that to know is to know that one knows, not because this
second order of knowing guarantees knowledge itself, but the reverse. I
cannot reconstruct the thing, and yet there are perceived things. In the
same way I can never coincide with my life which is for ever ﬂeeing
from itself, in spite of which there are inner perceptions. For the same
reason I am open to both illusion and truth about myself: that is, there
are acts in which I collect myself together in order to surpass myself.
The cogito is the recognition of this fundamental fact. In the proposition: ‘I think, I am’, the two assertions are to be equated with each
other, otherwise there would be no cogito. Nevertheless we must be
clear about the meaning of this equivalence: it is not the ‘I am’ which
is pre-eminently contained in the ‘I think,’ not my existence which is
brought down to the consciousness which I have of it, but conversely
the ‘I think,’ which is re-integrated into the transcending process of
the ‘I am’, and consciousness into existence.
It is true that it seems necessary to concede my absolute coincidence
with myself, if not in the case of will and feeling, at least in acts of ‘pure
thought’. If this were the case, all that we have said would appear to be
challenged, so that, far from appearing as a mere manner of existence,
thought would truly monopolize us. We must now, therefore, consider
the understanding. I think of the triangle, the three-dimensional space
to which it is supposed to belong, the extension of one of its sides, and
the line that can be drawn through its apex parallel to the opposite side,
and I perceive that this line, with the apex, forms three angles the sum
of which is equal to the sum of the angles of the triangle, and equal,
moreover, to two right angles. I am sure of the result which I regard as
proved; which means that my diagrammatic construction is not, as are
the strokes arbitrarily added by the child to his drawing, each one of
which completely transforms its meaning (‘it’s a house; no, it’s a boat;
no, it’s a man’), a collection of lines fortuitously drawn by my hand.
The process from start to ﬁnish has a triangle in view. The genesis of

the cogito

the ﬁgure is not only a real genesis, but an intelligible one; I make my
construction according to rules, and cause properties to make their
appearance in the ﬁgure—properties which are relations belonging to
the essence of the triangle. I do not, like the child, reproduce those
suggested by the ill-deﬁned ﬁgure which is actually there on the paper.
I am aware of presenting a proof, because I perceive a necessary link
between the collection of data which constitute the hypothesis and the
conclusion which I draw from them. It is this necessity which ensures
that I shall be able to repeat the operation with an indeﬁnite number of
empirical ﬁgures, and the necessity itself stems from the fact that at
each step in my demonstration, and each time I introduced new relationships, I remained conscious of the triangle as a stable structure
conditioned, and left intact, by them. This is why we can say, if we
want, that the proof consists in bringing the sum of the angles constructed into two diﬀerent groupings, and seeing that sum alternately
as equal to the sum of the angles of the triangle, and equal to two right
angles,21 but it must be added22 that here we have not merely two
successive conﬁgurations, the ﬁrst of which eliminates the second (as
is the case with the child sketching dreamily); the ﬁrst survives for me
while the second is in process of establishing itself, the sum of angles
which I equate with two right angles is the same as I elsewhere equate
with the sum of the angles of the triangle, all of which is possible only
provided that I go beyond the order of phenomena or appearances and
gain access to that of the eidos or of being. Truth would seem to be
impossible unless one enjoys an absolute self-possession in active
thought, failing which it would be unable to unfold in a set of
successive operations, and to produce a permanently valid result.
There would be neither thought nor truth but for an act whereby I
prevail over the temporal dispersal of the phases of thought, and the
mere de facto existence of my mental events. The important thing, however, is fully to understand the nature of this act. The necessity of the
proof is not an analytic necessity: the construction which enables
the conclusion to be reached is not really contained in the essence of
the triangle, but merely possible when that essence serves as a starting

point. There is no deﬁnition of a triangle which includes in advance
the properties subsequently to be demonstrated and the intermediate
steps leading to that demonstration. Extending one side, drawing
through the apex a line parallel to the opposite side, introducing the
theorem relating to parallels and their secant, these steps are possible
only if I consider the triangle itself as it is drawn on the paper, on the
blackboard or in the imagination, with its physiognomy, the concrete
arrangement of its lines, in short its Gestalt. Is not precisely this the
essence or the idea of a triangle? Let us, at the outset, reject any idea of
a formal essence of the triangle. Whatever one’s opinion of attempts at
formalization, it is in any case quite certain that they lay no claim to
provide a logic of invention, and that no logical deﬁnition of a triangle
could equal in fecundity the vision of the ﬁgure, or enable us to reach,
through a series of formal operations, conclusions not already established by the aid of intuition. This, it will perhaps be objected, touches
only on the psychological circumstances of discovery, so that in so far
as, after the event, it is possible to establish, between the hypothesis and
the conclusion, a link owing nothing to intuition, it is because intuition is not the inevitable mediator of thought and has no place in
logic. But the fact that formalization is always retrospective proves that
it is never otherwise than apparently complete, and that formal thought
feeds on intuitive thought. It reveals those unformulated axioms on
which reason is said to rest, and seems to bring to reason a certain
added rigour and to uncover the very foundations of our certainty; but
in reality the place in which certainty arises and in which a truth makes
its appearance is always intuitive thought, even though, or rather precisely because, the principles are tacitly assumed there. There would be no
experience of truth, and nothing would quench our ‘mental volubility’
if we thought vi formae, and if formal relations were not ﬁrst presented
to us crystallized in some particular thing. We should not even be able
to settle on a hypothesis from which to deduce the consequences, if we
did not ﬁrst hold it to be true. A hypothesis is what is presumed to be
true, so that hypothetical thinking presupposes some experience of de
facto truth. The construction relates, then, to the conﬁguration of the
triangle, to the way in which it occupies space, to the relations
expressed by the words ‘on’, ‘by’, ‘apex’ and ‘extend’. Do these relations constitute a kind of material essence of the triangle? If the words

the cogito

‘on’, ‘through’, etc., are to retain any meaning, it is in virtue of my
working on a perceptible or imaginary triangle, that is to say, one
which is at least potentially situated in my perceptual ﬁeld, orientated
in relation to ‘up’ and ‘down’, ‘right’ and ‘left’, or again, as we pointed
out earlier, implied in my general grip upon the world. The construction makes explicit the possibilities of the triangle, considered not in
the light of its deﬁnition and as a pure idea, but as a conﬁguration and
as the pole towards which my movements are directed. The conclusion
follows of necessity from the hypothesis because, in the act of constructing, the geometer has already experienced the possibility of the
transition. Let us try to give a better description of this act. We have
seen that what occurs is clearly not a purely manual operation, the
actual movement of my hand and pen over the paper, for in that case
there would be no diﬀerence between a construction and any arbitrary
set of strokes, and no demonstration would accrue. The construction is
a gesture, which means that the actual lines drawn are the outward
expression of an intention. But then what is this intention? I ‘consider’
the triangle, which is for me a set of lines with a certain orientation,
and if words such as ‘angle’ or ‘direction’ have any meaning for me, it
is in so far as I place myself at a point, and from it tend towards another
point, in so far as the system of spatial positions provides me with a
ﬁeld of possible movements. Thus do I grasp the concrete essence of
the triangle, which is not a collection of objective ‘characteristics’, but
the formula of an attitude, a certain modality of my hold on the world,
a structure, in short. When I construct, I commit the ﬁrst structure to a
second one, the ‘parallels and secant’ structure. How is that possible? It
is because my perception of the triangle was not, so to speak, ﬁxed and
dead, for the drawing of the triangle on the paper was merely its outer
covering; it was traversed by lines of force, and everywhere in it new
directions not traced out yet possible came to light. In so far as the
triangle was implicated in my hold on the world, it was bursting with
indeﬁnite possibilities of which the construction actually drawn was
merely one. The construction possesses a demonstrative value because I
cause it to emerge from the dynamic formula of the triangle. It
expresses my power to make apparent the sensible symbols of a certain
hold on things, which is my perception of the triangle’s structure. It is
an act of the productive imagination and not a return to the eternal idea

449

450 phenomenology of perception
of the triangle. Just as the localization of objects in space, according to
Kant himself, is not merely a mental operation, but one which utilizes
the body’s motility,23 movement conferring sensations at the particular
point on its trajectory at which those sensations are produced, so the
geometer, who, generally speaking, studies the objective laws of location, knows the relationships with which he is concerned only by
describing them, at least potentially, with his body. The subject of
geometry is a motor subject. This means in the ﬁrst place that our body
is not an object, nor is its movement a mere change of place in objective space, otherwise the problem would be merely shifted, and the
movement of one’s own body would shed no light on the problem of
the location of things, since it would be itself nothing but a thing.
There must be, as Kant conceded, a ‘motion which generates space’24
which is our intentional motion, distinct from ‘motion in space’,
which is that of things and of our passive body. But there is more to be
said: if motion is productive of space, we must rule out the possibility
that the body’s motility is a mere ‘instrument’25 for the constituting
consciousness. If there is a constituting consciousness, then bodily
movement is movement only in so far as that consciousness thinks of it
in that light;26 the constructive power rediscovers in it only what it has
put there, and the body is not even an instrument in this respect: it is an
object among objects. There is no psychology in a philosophy of constituting consciousness. Or at least there can be nothing valid for such a
psychology to say, for it can do nothing but apply the results of analytical reﬂection to each particular content, while nevertheless distorting them, since it deprives them of their transcendental signiﬁcance.
The body’s motion can play a part in the perception of the world only
if it is itself an original intentionality, a manner of relating itself to the
distinct object of knowledge. The world around us must be, not a
system of objects which we synthesize, but a totality of things, open to
us, towards which we project ourselves. The ‘motion which generates

the cogito

space’ does not deploy the trajectory from some metaphysical point
with no position in the real world, but from a certain here towards a
certain yonder, which are necessarily interchangeable. The project
towards motion is an act, which means that it traces out the spatiotemporal distance by actually covering it. The geometer’s thought, in
so far as it is necessarily sustained by this act, does not, therefore,
coincide with itself: it is purely and simply transcendence. In so far as,
by adding a construction, I can bring to light the properties of a triangle, and yet ﬁnd that the ﬁgure thus transformed does not cease to be
the same ﬁgure as I began with, and in so far, moreover, as I am able to
eﬀect a synthesis retaining the character of necessity, this is not because
my construction is upheld by a concept of the triangle in which all its
properties are included, or because, starting from perceptual consciousness, I arrive at the eidos: it is because I perform the synthesis of
the new property by means of my body, which immediately implants
me in space, while its autonomous motion enables me, through a
series of deﬁnite procedures, to arrive once more at an all-inclusive
view of space. Far from its being the case that geometrical thinking
transcends perceptual consciousness, it is from the world of perception
that I borrow the notion of essence. I believe that the triangle has
always had, and always will have, angles the sum of which equals two
right angles, as well as all the other less obvious properties which
geometry attributes to it, because I have had the experience of a real
triangle, and because, as a physical thing, it necessarily has within itself
everything that it has ever been able, or over will be able, to display.
Unless the perceived thing has for good and ever implanted within us
the ideal notion of a being which is what it is, there would be no
phenomenon of being, and mathematical thought would appear to us
as simply a creation. What I call the essence of the triangle is nothing
but this presumption of a completed synthesis, in terms of which we
have deﬁned the thing.
Our body, to the extent that it moves itself about, that is, to the
extent that it is inseparable from a view of the world and is that view
itself brought into existence, is the condition of possibility, not only of
the geometrical synthesis, but of all expressive operations and all
acquired views which constitute the cultural world. When we say that
thought is spontaneous, this does not mean that it coincides with itself;

451

452 phenomenology of perception
on the contrary it means that it outruns itself, and speech is precisely
that act through which it immortalizes itself as truth. It is, indeed,
obvious that speech cannot be regarded as a mere clothing for thought,
or expression as the translation, into an arbitrary system of symbols, of
a meaning already clear to itself. It is said again and again that sounds
and phonemes have no meaning in themselves, and that all our consciousness can ﬁnd in language is what it has put there. But it would
follow from this that language can teach us nothing, and that it can at
the most arouse in us new combinations of those meanings already
possessed by us. But this is just what the experience of language refutes.
It is true that communication presupposes a system of correspondences
such as the dictionary provides, but it goes beyond these, and what
gives its meaning to each word is the sentence. It is because it has been
used in various contexts that the word gradually accumulates a signiﬁcance which it is impossible to establish absolutely. A telling utterance
or a good book impose their meaning upon us. Thus they carry it
within them in a certain way. As for the speaking subject, he too must
be enabled to outrun what he thought before, and to ﬁnd in his own
words more than the thought he was putting into them, otherwise we
should not see thought, even solitary thought, seeking expression with
such perseverance. Speech is, therefore, that paradoxical operation
through which, by using words of a given sense, and already available
meanings, we try to follow up an intention which necessarily outstrips,
modiﬁes, and itself, in the last analysis, stabilizes the meanings of the
words which translate it. Constituted language plays the same limited
rôle in the work of expression as do colours in painting: had we not
eyes, or more generally senses, there would be no painting at all for us,
yet the picture ‘tells’ us more than the mere use of our senses can ever
do. The picture over and above the sense-data, speech over and above
linguistic data must, therefore, in themselves possess a signifying virtue, independently of any meaning that exists for itself, in the mind of
the spectator or listener. ‘By using words as the painter uses colours and
the musician notes, we are trying to constitute, out of a spectacle or an
emotion, or even an abstract idea, a kind of equivalent or specie soluble
in the mind. Here the expression becomes the principal thing. We
mould and animate the reader, we cause him to participate in our
creative or poetic action, putting into the hidden mouth of his mind

the cogito

the message of a certain object or of a certain feeling.’27 In the painter
or the speaking subject, picture and utterance respectively do not illustrate a ready-made thought, but make that thought their own.
This is why we have been led to distinguish between a secondary speech
which renders a thought already acquired, and an originating
speech which brings it into existence, in the ﬁrst place for ourselves,
and then for others. Now all words which have become mere signs for
a univocal thought have been able to do so only because they have ﬁrst
of all functioned as originating words, and we can still remember with
what richness they appeared to be endowed, and how they were like a
landscape new to us, while we were engaged in ‘acquiring’ them, and
while they still fulﬁlled the primordial function of expression. Thus
self-possession and coincidence with the self do not serve to deﬁne
thought, which is, on the contrary, an outcome of expression and
always an illusion, in so far as the clarity of what is acquired rests upon
the fundamentally obscure operation which has enabled us to
immortalize within ourselves a moment of ﬂeeting life. We are invited
to discern beneath thinking which basks in its acquisitions, and oﬀers
merely a brief resting-place in the unending process of expression,
another thought which is struggling to establish itself, and succeeds
only by bending the resources of constituted language to some fresh
usage. This operation must be considered as an ultimate fact, since any
explanation of it—whether empiricist, reducing new meanings to
given ones; or idealist, positing an absolute knowledge immanent in
the most primitive forms of knowledge—would amount to a denial of
it. Language outruns us, not merely because the use of speech always
presupposes a great number of thoughts which are not present in the
mind and which are covered by each word, but also for another reason,
and a more profound one: namely, that these thoughts themselves,
when present, were not at any time ‘pure’ thoughts either, for already
in them there was a surplus of the signiﬁed over the signifying, the
same eﬀort of thought already thought to equal thinking thought, the
same provisional amalgam of both which gives rise to the whole mystery of expression. That which is called an idea is necessarily linked to
an act of expression, and owes to it its appearance of autonomy. It is a

cultural object, like the church, the street, the pencil or the Ninth
Symphony. It may be said in reply that the church can be burnt down,
the street and pencil destroyed, and that, if all the scores of the Ninth
Symphony and all musical instruments were reduced to ashes, it would
survive only for a few brief years in the memory of those who had
heard it, whereas on the other hand the idea of the triangle and its
properties are imperishable. In fact, the idea of the triangle with
its properties, and of the quadratic equation, have their historical and
geographical area, and if the tradition in which they have been handed
down to us, and the cultural instruments which bear them on, were to
be destroyed, fresh acts of creative expression would be needed to
revive them in the world. What is true, however, is that, once they have
made their ﬁrst appearance, subsequent ‘appearances’, if successful,
add nothing and if unsuccessful, subtract nothing, from the quadratic
equation, which remains an inexhaustible possession among us. But
the same may be said of the Ninth Symphony, which lives on in its
intelligible abode, as Proust has said, whether it is played well or badly;
or rather which continues its existence in a more occult time than
natural time. The time of ideas is not be confused with that in which
books appear and disappear, and musical works are printed or lost: a
book which has always been reprinted one day ceases to be read, a
musical work of which there were only a few copies extant is suddenly
much sought after. The existence of the idea must not be confused with
the empirical existence of the means of expression, for ideas endure or
fall into oblivion, and the intelligible sky subtly changes colour. We
have already drawn a distinction between empirical speech—the word
as a phenomenon of sound, the fact that a certain word is uttered at a
certain moment by a certain person, which may happen independently
of thought—and transcendental or authentic speech, that by which an
idea begins to exist. But if there had been no mankind with phonatory
or articulatory organs, and a respiratory apparatus—or at least with a
body and the ability to move himself, there would have been no speech
and no ideas. What remains true is that in speech, to a greater extent
than in music or painting, thought seems able to detach itself from its
material instruments and acquire an eternal value. There is a sense in
which all triangles which will ever exist through the workings of physical causality will always have angles the sum of which equals two right

the cogito

angles, even if a time comes when men have forgotten their geometry,
and there is not a single person left who knows any. But in this case it is
because speech is applied to nature, whereas music, and painting, like
poetry, create their own object, and as soon as they become suﬃciently
aware of themselves, deliberately conﬁne themselves within the cultural world. Prosaic, and particularly scientiﬁc, utterance is a cultural
entity which at the same time lays claim to translate a truth relating to
nature in itself. Now we know that this is not the case, for modern
criticism of the sciences has clearly shown the constructive element in
them. ‘Real’, i.e. perceived, triangles, do not necessarily have, for all
eternity, angles the sum of which equals two right angles, if it is true
that the space in which we live is no less amenable to non-Euclidean
than to Euclidean geometry. Thus there is no fundamental diﬀerence
between the various modes of expression, and no privileged position
can be accorded to any of them on the alleged ground that it expresses
a truth in itself. Speech is as dumb as music, music as eloquent as
speech. Expression is everywhere creative, and what is expressed is
always inseparable from it. There is no analysis capable of making
language crystal clear and arraying it before us as if it were an object.
The act of speech is clear only for the person who is actually speaking
or listening; it becomes obscure as soon as we try to bring explicitly to
light those reasons which have led us to understand thus and not
otherwise. We can say of it what we have said of perception, and what
Pascal says about opinions: in all three cases we have the same miracle
of an immediately apprehended clarity, which vanishes as soon as we
try to break it down to what we believe to be its component elements. I
speak, and I understand myself and am understood quite unambiguously; I take a new grip on my life, and others take a new grip on it too.
I may say that ‘I have been waiting for a long time’, or that someone ‘is
dead’, and I think I know what I am saying. Yet if I question myself on
time or the experience of death, which were implied in my words,
there is nothing clear in my mind. This is because I have tried to speak
about speech, to re-enact the act of expression which gave signiﬁcance
to the words ‘dead’ and ‘time’, to extend the brief hold on my experience which they ensure for me. These second or third order acts of
expression, like the rest, have indeed in each case their convincing
clarity, without, however, ever enabling me to dispel the fundamental

455

456 phenomenology of perception
obscurity of what is expressed, or to eliminate the distance separating
my thought from itself. Must we conclude from this28 that, born and
developed in obscurity, yet capable of clarity, language is nothing but
the obverse of an inﬁnite Thought, and the message of that Thought as
communicated to us? This would mean losing contact with the analysis
which we have just carried out, and reaching a conclusion in conﬂict
with what has been established as we have gone along. Language transcends us and yet we speak. If we are led to conclude from this that
there exists a transcendent thought spelt out by our words, we are
supposing that an attempt at expression is brought to completion, after
saying that it can never be so, and invoking an absolute thought, when
we have just shown that any such thought is beyond our conception.
Such is the principle of Pascal’s apologetics; but the more it is shown
that man is without absolute power, the more any assertion of an
absolute is made, not probable, but on the contrary suspect. In fact
analysis demonstrates, not that there is behind language a transcendent
thought, but that language transcends itself in speech, that speech itself
brings about that concordance between me and myself, and between
myself and others, on which an attempt is being made to base that
thought. The phenomenon of language, in the double sense of primary
fact and remarkable occurrence, is not explained, but eliminated, if we
duplicate it with some transcendent thought, since it consists in this:
that an act of thought, once expressed, has the power to outlive itself. It
is not, as is often held, that the verbal formula serves us as a mnemonic
means: merely committed to writing or to memory, it would be useless had we not acquired once and for all the inner power of interpreting it. To give expression is not to substitute, for new thought, a system
of stable signs to which unchangeable thoughts are linked, it is to
ensure, by the use of words already used, that the new intention carries
on the heritage of the past, it is at a stroke to incorporate the past into
the present, and weld that present to a future, to open a whole temporal cycle in which the ‘acquired’ thought will remain present as a
dimension, without our needing henceforth to summon it up or
reproduce it. What is known as the non-temporal in thought is what,
having thus carried forward the past and committed the future, is
28

As does B. Parain, Recherches sur la nature et les fonctions du langage, Chap. XI.

the cogito

presumptively of all time and is therefore anything but transcendent in
relation to time. The non-temporal is the acquired.
Time itself presents us with the prime model of this permanent
acquisition. If time is the dimension in accordance with which events
drive each other successively from the scene, it is also that in accordance with which each one of them wins its unchallengeable place. To
say that an event takes place is to say that it will always be true that it has
taken place. Each moment of time, in virtue of its very essence, posits
an existence against which the other moments of time are powerless.
After the construction is drawn, the geometrical relation is acquired;
even if I then forget the details of the proof, the mathematical gesture
establishes a tradition. Van Gogh’s paintings have their place in me for
all time, a step is taken from which I cannot retreat, and, even though I
retain no clear recollection of the pictures which I have seen, my whole
subsequent aesthetic experience will be that of someone who has
become acquainted with the painting of Van Gogh, exactly as a middle
class man turned workman always remains, even in his manner of
being a workman, a middle-class-man-turned-workman, or as an act
confers a certain quality upon us for ever, even though we may afterwards repudiate it and change our beliefs. Existence always carries
forward its past, whether it be by accepting or disclaiming it. We are, as
Proust declared, perched on a pyramid of past life, and if we do not see
this, it is because we are obsessed by objective thought. We believe that
our past, for ourselves, is reducible to the express memories which we
are able to contemplate. We sever our existence from the past itself, and
allow it to pick up only those threads of the past which are present. But
how are these threads to be recognized as threads of the past unless we
enjoy in some other way a direct opening upon that past? Acquisition
must be accepted as an irreducible phenomenon. What we have
experienced is, and remains, permanently ours; and in old age a man is
still in contact with his youth. Every present as it arises is driven into
time like a wedge and stakes its claim to eternity. Eternity is not another
order of time, but the atmosphere of time. It is true that a false thought,
no less than a true one, possesses this sort of eternity: if I am mistaken
at this moment, it is for ever true that I am mistaken. It would seem
necessary, therefore, that there should be, in true thought, a diﬀerent
fertility, and that it should remain true not only as a past actually lived

457

458 phenomenology of perception
through, but also as a perpetual present for ever carried forward in
time’s succession. This, however, does not secure any essential diﬀerence between truths of fact and truths of reason. For there is not one of
my actions, not one of even my fallacious thoughts, once it is adhered
to, which has not been directed towards a value or a truth, and which,
in consequence, does not retain its permanent relevance in the subsequent course of my life, not only as an indelible fact, but also as a
necessary stage on the road to the more complete truths or values
which I have since recognized. My truths have been built out of these
errors, and carry them along in their eternity. Conversely, there is not
one truth of reason which does not retain its coeﬃcient of facticity: the
alleged transparency of Euclidean geometry is one day revealed as
operative for a certain period in the history of the human mind, and
signiﬁes simply that, for a time, men were able to take a homogeneous
three-dimensional space as the ‘ground’ of their thoughts, and to
assume unquestioningly what generalized science will come to consider as a contingent account of space. Thus every truth of fact is a truth
of reason, and vice versa. The relation of reason to fact, or eternity to
time, like that of reﬂection to the unreﬂective, of thought to language
or of thought to perception is this two-way relationship that phenomenology has called Fundierung: the founding term, or originator—time,
the unreﬂective, the fact, language, perception—is primary in the sense
that the originated is presented as a determinate or explicit form of the
originator, which prevents the latter from reabsorbing the former, and
yet the originator is not primary in the empiricist sense and the originated is not simply derived from it, since it is through the originated
that the originator is made manifest. It is for this reason that it is a
matter of indiﬀerence whether we say that the present foreshadows
eternity or that the eternity of truth is merely a sublimation of the
present. This ambiguity cannot be resolved, but it can be understood as
ultimate, if we recapture the intuition of real time which preserves
everything, and which is at the core of both proof and expression.
‘Reﬂection on the creative power of the mind,’ says Brunschvicg,29
‘implies, in every certainty of experience, the feeling that, in any
determinate truth that one may have managed to demonstrate, there
29

Les Progrès de la Conscience dans la Philosophie occidentale, p. 794.

the cogito

exists a soul of truth which outruns it and frees itself from it, a soul
which can detach itself from the particular expression of that truth in
order to adumbrate a deeper and more comprehensive expression,
although this drive forward in no way impairs the eternity of the true.’
What is this eternally true that no one possesses? What is this thing
expressed which lies beyond all expression, and, if we have the right to
posit it, why is it our constant concern to arrive at a more precise
expression? What is this One round which minds and truths are disposed, as if they tended towards it, while it is maintained at the same
time that they tend towards no pre-established term? The idea of a
transcendent Being had at least the advantage of not stultifying the
actions through which, in an ever diﬃcult process of carrying forward,
each consciousness and intersubjectivity themselves forge their own
unity. It is true that, if these actions belong to that most intimate part of
ourselves accessible to us, the positing of God contributes nothing to
the elucidation of our life. We experience, not a genuine eternity and a
participation in the One, but concrete acts of taking up and carrying
forward by which, through time’s accidents, we are linked in relationships with ourselves and others. In short, we experience a participation in
the world, and ‘being-in-truth’ is indistinguishable from being-in-theworld.
We are now in a position to make up our minds about the question
of evidence, and to describe the experience of truth. There are truths
just as there are perceptions: not that we can ever array before ourselves
in their entirety the reasons for any assertion—there are merely
motives, we have merely a hold on time and not full possession of it—
but because it is of the essence of time to take itself up as it leaves itself
behind, and to draw itself together into visible things, into ﬁrsthand
evidence. All consciousness is, in some measure, perceptual consciousness. If it were possible to lay bare and unfold all the presuppositions in
what I call my reason or my ideas at each moment, we should always
ﬁnd experiences which have not been made explicit, large-scale contributions from past and present, a whole ‘sedimentary history’30
which is not only relevant to the genesis of my thought, but which
determines its signiﬁcance. For an absolute evidence, free from any
30

459

460 phenomenology of perception
presupposition, to be possible, and for my thought to be able to pierce
through to itself, catch itself in action, and arrive at a pure ‘assent of the
self to the self’, it would, to speak the language of the Kantians, have to
cease to be an event and become an act through and through: in the
language of the Schoolmen, its formal reality would have to be
included in its objective reality; in the language of Malebranche, it
would have to cease to be ‘perception’, ‘sentiment’ or ‘contact’ with
truth, to become pure ‘idea’ and ‘vision’ of the truth. It would be
necessary, in other words, that instead of being myself, I should
become purely and simply one who knows myself, and that the world
should have ceased to exist around me in order to become purely and
simply an object before me. In relation to what we are by reason of our
acquisitions and this pre-existent world, we have a power of placing in
abeyance, and that suﬃces to ensure our freedom from determinism. I
may well close my eyes, and stop up my ears, I shall nevertheless not
cease to see, if it is only the blackness before my eyes, or to hear, if only
silence, and in the same way I can ‘bracket’ my opinions or the beliefs I
have acquired, but, whatever I think or decide, it is always against the
background of what I have previously believed or done. Habemus ideam
veram, we possess a truth, but this experience of truth would be absolute
knowledge only if we could thematize every motive, that is, if we
ceased to be in a situation. The actual possession of the true idea does
not, therefore, entitle us to predicate an intelligible abode of adequate
thought and absolute productivity, it establishes merely a ‘teleology’31
of consciousness which, from this ﬁrst instrument, will forge more
perfect ones, and these in turn more perfect ones still, and so on
endlessly. ‘Only through an eidetic intuition can the essence of eidetic
intuition be elucidated,’ says Husserl.32 The intuition of some particular essence necessarily precedes, in our experience, the essence of intuition. The only way to think of thought is in the ﬁrst place to think of
something, and it is therefore essential to that thought not to take itself
as an object. To think of thought is to adopt in relation to it an attitude
that we have initially learned in relation to ‘things’; it is never to eliminate, but merely to push further back the opacity that thought presents
31

This notion recurs frequently in the later writings of Husserl.

the cogito

to itself. Every halt in the forward movement of consciousness, every
focus on the object, every appearance of a ‘something’ or of an idea
presupposes a subject who has suspended self-questioning at least in
that particular respect. Which is why, as Descartes maintained, it is true
both that certain ideas are presented to me as irresistibly self-evident de
facto, and that this fact is never valid de jure, and that it never does away
with the possibility of doubt arising as soon as we are no longer in the
presence of the idea. It is no accident that self-evidence itself may be
called into question, because certainty is doubt, being the carrying forward of a tradition of thought which cannot be condensed into an
evident ‘truth’ without my giving up all attempts to make it explicit. It
is for the same reasons that a self-evident truth is irresistible in fact, yet
always questionable, which amounts to two ways of saying the same
thing: namely, that it is irresistible because I take for granted a certain
acquisition of experience, a certain ﬁeld of thought, and precisely for
this reason it appears to me as self-evident for a certain thinking nature,
the one which I enjoy and perpetuate, but which remains contingent
and given to itself. The consistency of a thing perceived, of a geometrical relationship or of an idea, is arrived at only provided that I
give up trying by every means to make it more explicit, and instead
allow myself to come to rest in it. Once launched, and committed to a
certain set of thoughts, Euclidean space, for example, or the conditions
governing the existence of a certain society, I discover evident truths;
but these are not unchallengeable, since perhaps this space or this
society are not the only ones possible. It is therefore of the essence of
certainty to be established only with reservations; there is an opinion
which is not a provisional form of knowledge destined to give way
later to an absolute form, but on the contrary, both the oldest or most
rudimentary, and the most conscious or mature form of knowledge—
an opinion which is primary in the double sense of ‘original’ and
‘fundamental’. This is what calls up before us something in general, to
which positing* thought—doubt or demonstration—can subsequently relate in aﬃrmation or denial. There is signiﬁcance, something and not nothing, there is an indeﬁnite train of concordant
experiences, to which this ash-tray in its permanence testiﬁes, or the
* I.e. ‘thetic’ (Translator’s note).

461

462 phenomenology of perception
truth which I hit upon yesterday and to which I think I can revert
today.
This evidentness of the phenomenon, or again of the ‘world’, is no
less misunderstood when we try to reach being without contact with
the phenomenon, that is, when we make being necessary, as when we
cut the phenomenon oﬀ from being, when we degrade it to the status
of mere appearance or possibility. The ﬁrst conception is Spinoza’s.
Primary opinion is here subordinated to absolute self-evidence, and the
notion, ‘there is something’ which is an amalgam of being and nothingness, to the notion ‘Being exists’. One rejects as meaningless any
questioning of being: it is impossible to ask why there is something
rather than nothing, and why this world rather than a diﬀerent one,
since the shape of this world and the very existence of a world are
merely consequences of necessary being. The second conception
reduces self-evidence to appearance: all my truths are after all selfevident only for me, and for a thought fashioned like mine; they are
bound up with my psycho-physiological constitution and the existence
of this world. Other forms of thought functioning in accordance with
other rules, and other possible worlds, can be conceived as having the
same claim to reality as this one. And here the question why there is
something rather than nothing seems apposite, and why this particular
world has come into being, but the reply is necessarily out of our
reach, since we are imprisoned in our psycho-physiological make-up,
which is a simple fact like the shape of our face or the number of our
teeth. This second conception is not so diﬀerent from the ﬁrst as it
might appear: it implies a tacit reference to an absolute knowledge and
an absolute being in relation to which our factual self-evidences, or
synthetic truths, are considered inadequate. According to the phenomenological conception, this dogmatism on the one hand and scepticism on the other are both left behind. The laws of our thought and our
self-evident truths are certainly facts, but they are not detachable from
us, they are implied in any conception that we may form of being and
the possible. It is not a question of conﬁning ourselves to phenomena,
of imprisoning consciousness in its own states, while retaining the
possibility of another being beyond apparent being, nor of treating our
thought as one fact among many, but of deﬁning being as that which
appears, and consciousness as a universal fact. I think, and this or that

the cogito

thought appears to me as true; I am well aware that it is not
unconditionally true, and that the process of making it totally explicit
would be an endless task; but the fact remains that at the moment I
think, I think something, and that any other truth, in the name of
which I might wish to discount this one, must, if it is to be called a
truth for me, square with the ‘true’ thought of which I have experience. If I try to imagine Martians, or angels, or some divine thought
outside the realm of my logic, this Martian, angelic or divine thought
must ﬁgure in my universe without completely disrupting it.33 My
thought, my self-evident truth is not one fact among others, but a
value-fact which envelops and conditions every other possible one.
There is no other world possible in the sense in which mine is, not
because mine is necessary as Spinoza thought, but because any ‘other
world’ that I might try to conceive would set limits to this one, would
be found on its boundaries, and would consequently merely fuse with
it. Consciousness, if it is not absolute truth or α-λεθεια, at least rules
out all absolute falsity. Our mistakes, illusions and questions are indeed
mistakes, illusions and questions. Error is not consciousness of error; it
even excludes such consciousness. Our questions do not always admit
of answers, and to say with Marx that man poses for himself only
problems that he can solve is to revive a theological optimism and
postulate the consummation of the world. Our errors become truths
only once they are recognized, and there remains a diﬀerence between
their revealed and their latent content of truth, between their alleged
and their actual signiﬁcance. The truth is that neither error nor doubt
ever cut us oﬀ from the truth, because they are surrounded by a world
horizon in which the teleology of consciousness summons us to an
eﬀort at resolving them. Finally, the contingency of the world must not
be understood as a deﬁciency in being, a break in the stuﬀ of necessary
being, a threat to rationality, nor as a problem to be solved as soon as
possible by the discovery of some deeper-laid necessity. That is ontic
contingency, contingency within the bounds of the world. Ontological contingency, the contingency of the world itself, being radical, is,
33

See Logische Untersuchungen, I, p. 117. What is sometimes termed Husserl’s rationalism is
in reality the recognition of subjectivity as an inalienable fact, and of the world to which
it is directed as omnitudo realitatis.

463

464 phenomenology of perception
on the other hand, what forms the basis once and for all of our ideas of
truth. The world is that reality of which the necessary and the possible
are merely provinces.
To sum up, we are restoring to the cogito a temporal thickness. If there
is not endless doubt, and if ‘I think’, it is because I plunge on into
provisional thoughts and, by deeds, overcome time’s discontinuity.
Thus vision is brought to rest in a thing seen which both precedes and
outlasts it. Have we got out of our diﬃculty? We have admitted that the
certainty of vision and that of the thing seen are of a piece. Must we
conclude from this that, since the thing seen is never absolutely certain,
as illusions show, vision also is involved in this uncertainty, or, on the
contrary, that, since vision on its own is absolutely certain, so is the
thing seen, so that I am never really mistaken? The second solution
would amount to reinstating the immanence which we have banished.
But if we adopted the ﬁrst, thought would be cut oﬀ from itself, there
would no longer be anything but ‘facts of consciousness’ which might
be called internal by nominal deﬁnition, but which, for me, would be
as opaque as things; there would no longer be either inner experience
or consciousness, and the experience of the cogito would be once more
forgotten. When we describe consciousness as involved through its
body in a space, through its language in a history, through its prejudices in a concrete form of thought, it is not a matter of setting it back
in a series of objective events, even though they be ‘psychic’ events,
and in the causal system of the world. He who doubts cannot, while
doubting, doubt that he doubts. Doubt, even when generalized, is not
the abolition of my thought, it is merely a pseudo-nothingness, for I
cannot extricate myself from being; my act of doubting itself creates
the possibility of certainty and is there for me, it occupies me, I am
committed to it, and I cannot pretend to be nothing at the time I
execute it. Reﬂection, which moves all things away to a distance, discovers itself as at least given to itself in the sense that it cannot think of
itself as eliminated, or stand apart from itself. But this does not mean
that reﬂection and thought are elementary facts there to be observed as
such. As Montaigne clearly saw, one can call into question thought
which is loaded with a sediment of history and weighed down with its
own being, one can entertain doubts about doubt itself, considered as a
deﬁnite modality of thought and as consciousness of a doubtful object,

the cogito

but the formula of radical reﬂection is not: ‘I know nothing’—a formula which it is all too easy to catch in ﬂat contradiction with itself—
but: ‘What do I know?’ Descartes was not unmindful of this. He has
frequently been credited with having gone beyond sceptical doubt,
which is a mere state, and with making doubt into a method, an act,
and with having thus provided consciousness with a ﬁxed point and
reinstated certainty. But, in fact, Descartes did not suspend doubt in the
face of the certainty of doubt itself, as if the act of doubting were
suﬃcient to sweep doubt away by entailing a certainty. He took it
further. He does not say: ‘I doubt, therefore I am’, but ‘I think, therefore I am’, which means that doubt itself is certain, not as actual doubt,
but as pure thought about doubting and, since the same might be said
in turn about this thought, the only proposition which is absolutely
certain and which halts doubt in its tracks because it is implied by that
doubt, is: ‘I think,’ or again, ‘something appears to me’. There is no act,
no particular experience which exactly ﬁlls my consciousness and
imprisons my freedom, ‘there is no thought which abolishes the power
to think and brings it to a conclusion—no deﬁnite position of the bolt
that ﬁnally closes the lock. No, there is no thought which is a resolution born of its own very development and, as it were, the ﬁnal chord
of this permanent dissonance.’34 No particular thought reaches
through to the core of our thought in general, nor is any thought
conceivable without another possible thought as a witness to it. And
this is no imperfection from which we may imagine consciousness
freed. If there must be consciousness, if something must appear to
someone, it is necessary that behind all our particular thoughts there
should lie a retreat of not-being, a Self. I must avoid equating myself
with a series of ‘consciousnesses’, for each of these, with its load of
sedimentary history and sensible implications, must present itself to a
perpetual absentee. Our situation, then, is as follows: in order to know
that we think, it is necessary in the ﬁrst place that we actually should
think. Yet this commitment does not dispel all doubts, for my thoughts
do not deprive me of my power to question; a word or an idea, considered as events in my history, have meaning for me only if I take up
this meaning from within. I know that I think through such and such
34

Valéry, Introduction à la méthode de Léonard de Vinci, Variété, p. 194.

465

466 phenomenology of perception
particular thoughts that I have, and I know that I have these thoughts
because I carry them forward, that is, because I know that I think in
general. The aim at a transcendent objective and the view of myself
aiming at it, the awareness of the connected and of connecting are in a
circular relationship. The problem is how I can be the constituting
agent of my thought in general, failing which it would not be thought
by anybody, would pass unnoticed and would therefore not be thought
at all—without ever being that agent of my particular thoughts, since I
never see them come into being in the full light of day, but merely
know myself through them. The question is how subjectivity can be
both dependent yet indeclinable.
Let us tackle this by taking language as our example. There is a
consciousness of myself which makes use of language and is humming
with words. I read, let us say, the Second Meditation. It has indeed to do
with me, but a me in idea, an idea which is, strictly speaking, neither
mine nor, for that matter, Descartes’, but that of any reﬂecting man. By
following the meaning of the words and the argument, I reach the
conclusion that indeed because I think, I am; but this is merely a verbal
cogito, for I have grasped my thought and my existence only through the
medium of language, and the true formula of this cogito should be: ‘One
thinks, therefore one is.’ The wonderful thing about language is that it
promotes its own oblivion: my eyes follow the lines on the paper, and
from the moment I am caught up in their meaning, I lose sight of
them. The paper, the letters on it, my eyes and body are there only as
the minimum setting of some invisible operation. Expression fades out
before what is expressed, and this is why its mediating rôle may pass
unnoticed, and why Descartes nowhere mentions it. Descartes, and a
fortiori his reader, begin their meditation in what is already a universe of
discourse. This certainty which we enjoy of reaching, beyond expression, a truth separable from it and of which expression is merely the
garment and contingent manifestation, has been implanted in us precisely by language. It appears as a mere sign only once it has provided
itself with a meaning, and the coming to awareness, if it is to be
complete, must rediscover the expressive unity in which both signs and
meaning appear in the ﬁrst place. When a child cannot speak, or cannot
yet speak the adult’s language, the linguistic ritual which unfolds
around him has no hold on him, he is near us in the same way as is a

the cogito

spectator with a poor seat at the theatre; he sees clearly enough that we
are laughing and gesticulating, he hears the nasal tune being played,
but there is nothing at the end of those gestures or behind those words,
nothing happens for him. Language takes on a meaning for the child
when it establishes a situation for him. A story is told in a children’s book
of the disappointment of a small boy who put on his grandmother’s
spectacles and took up her book in the expectation of being able himself to ﬁnd in it the stories which she used to tell him. The tale ends
with these words: ‘Well, what a fraud! Where’s the story? I can see
nothing but black and white.’ For the child the ‘story’ and the thing
expressed are not ‘ideas’ or ‘meanings’, nor are speaking or reading
‘intellectual operations’. The story is a world which there must be
some way of magically calling up by putting on spectacles and leaning
over a book. The power possessed by language of bringing the thing
expressed into existence, of opening up to thought new ways, new
dimensions and new landscapes, is, in the last analysis, as obscure for
the adult as for the child. In every successful work, the signiﬁcance
carried into the reader’s mind exceeds language and thought as already
constituted and is magically thrown into relief during the linguistic
incantation, just as the story used to emerge from grandmother’s book.
In so far as we believe that, through thought, we are in direct communication with a universe of truth in which we are at one with
others, in so far as Descartes’ text seems merely to arouse in us
thoughts already formed, and we seem never to learn anything from
outside, and ﬁnally in so far as a philosopher, in a meditation purporting to be thoroughgoing, never even mentions language as the condition of the reading of the cogito, nor overtly invites us to pass from the
idea to the practice of the cogito, it is because we take the process of
expression for granted, because it ﬁgures among our acquisitions. The
cogito at which we arrive by reading Descartes (and even the one which
Descartes eﬀects in relation to expression and when, looking back on
his past life, he fastens it down, objectiﬁes it and ‘characterizes’ it as
indubitable) is, then, a spoken cogito, put into words and understood in
words, and for this very reason not attaining its objective, since that
part of our existence which is engaged in ﬁxing our life in conceptual
forms, and thinking of it as indubitable, is escaping focus and thought.
Shall we therefore conclude that language envelops us, and that we are

467

468 phenomenology of perception
led by it, much as the realist believes he is subject to the determinism
of the external world, or as the theologian believes he is led on by
Providence? This would be to forget half the truth. For after all, words,
‘cogito’ and ‘sum’ for example, may well have an empirical and statistical meaning, for it is the case that they are not directed speciﬁcally to
my own experience, but form the basis of a general and anonymous
thought. Nevertheless, I should ﬁnd them not so much derivative and
inauthentic as meaningless, and I should be unable even to read
Descartes’ book, were I not, before any speech can begin, in contact
with my own life and thought, and if the spoken cogito did not
encounter within me a tacit cogito. This silent cogito was the one Descartes sought when writing his Meditations. He gave life and direction to
all those expressive operations which, by deﬁnition, always miss their
target since, between Descartes’ existence and the knowledge of it
which he acquires, they interpose the full thickness of cultural acquisitions. And yet Descartes would not even have tried to put these expressive operations into operation had he not in the ﬁrst place caught a
glimpse of his existence. The whole question amounts to gaining a
clear understanding of the unspoken cogito, to putting into it only what
is really there, and not making language into a product of consciousness on the excuse that consciousness is not a product of language.
Neither the word nor the meaning of the word is, in fact constituted by
consciousness. Let us make this clear. The word is certainly never
reducible to one of its embodiments. The word ‘sleet’, for example, is
not the set of characters which I have just written on the paper, nor that
other set of signs that I once read in a book for the ﬁrst time, nor again
the sound that runs through the air when I pronounce it. Those are
merely reproductions of the word, in which I recognize it but which
do not exhaust it. Am I then to say that the word ‘sleet’ is the uniﬁed
idea of these manifestations, and that it exists only for my consciousness and through a synthesis of identiﬁcation? To do so would be to
forget what psychology has taught us about language. To speak, as we
have seen, is not to call up verbal images and articulate words in
accordance with the imagined model. By undertaking a critical examination of the verbal image, and showing that the speaking subject
plunges into speech without imagining the words he is about to utter,
modern psychology eliminates the word as a representation, or as an

the cogito

object for consciousness, and reveals a motor presence of the word
which is not the knowledge of the word. The word ‘sleet’, when it is
known to me, is not an object which I recognize through any identiﬁcatory synthesis, but a certain use made of my phonatory equipment, a
certain modulation of my body as a being in the world. Its generality is
not that of the idea, but that of a behavioural style ‘understood’ by my
body in so far as the latter is a behaviour-producing power, in this case
a phoneme-producing one. One day I ‘caught on’ to the word ‘sleet’,
much as one imitates a gesture, not, that is, by analysing it and performing an articulatory or phonetic action corresponding to each part
of the word as heard, but by hearing it as a single modulation of the
world of sound, and because this acoustic entity presents itself as
‘something to pronounce’ in virtue of the all-embracing correspondence existing between my perceptual potentialities and my motor ones,
which are elements of my indivisible and open existence. The word has
never been inspected, analysed, known and constituted, but caught and
taken up by a power of speech and, in the last analysis, by a motor
power given to me along with the ﬁrst experience I have of my body
and its perceptual and practical ﬁelds. As for the meaning of the word, I
learn it as I learn to use a tool, by seeing it used in the context of a
certain situation. The word’s meaning is not compounded of a certain
number of physical characteristics belonging to the object; it is ﬁrst
and foremost the aspect taken on by the object in human experience,
for example my wonder in the face of these hard, then friable, then
melting pellets falling ready-made from the sky. Here we have a meeting of the human and the non-human and, as it were, a piece of the
world’s behaviour, a certain version of its style, and the generality of its
meaning as well as that of the vocable is not the generality of the
concept, but of the world as typical. Thus language presupposes nothing less than a consciousness of language, a silence of consciousness
embracing the world of speech in which words ﬁrst receive a form and
meaning. This is why consciousness is never subordinated to any
empirical language, why languages can be translated and learned, and
ﬁnally, why language is not an attribute of external origin, in the
sociologist’s sense. Behind the spoken cogito, the one which is converted into discourse and into essential truth, there lies a tacit cogito,
myself experienced by myself. But this subjectivity, indeclinable, has

469

470 phenomenology of perception
upon itself and upon the world only a precarious hold. It does not
constitute the world, it divines the world’s presence round about it as a
ﬁeld not provided by itself; nor does it constitute the word, but speaks
as we sing when we are happy; nor again the meaning of the word,
which instantaneously emerges for it in its dealing with the world and
other men living in it, being at the intersection of many lines of
behaviour, and being, even once ‘acquired’, as precise and yet as
indeﬁnable as the signiﬁcance of a gesture. The tacit cogito, the presence
of oneself to oneself, being no less than existence, is anterior to any
philosophy, and knows itself only in those extreme situations in which
it is under threat: for example, in the dread of death or of another’s
gaze upon me. What is believed to be thought about thought, as pure
feeling of the self, cannot yet be thought and needs to be revealed. The
consciousness which conditions language is merely a comprehensive
and inarticulate grasp upon the world, like that of the infant at its ﬁrst
breath, or of the man about to drown and who is impelled towards life,
and though it is true that all particular knowledge is founded on this
primary view, it is true also that the latter waits to be won back, ﬁxed
and made explicit by perceptual exploration and by speech. Silent consciousness grasps itself only as a generalized ‘I think’ in face of a
confused world ‘to be thought about’. Any particular seizure, even the
recovery of this generalized project by philosophy, demands that the
subject bring into action powers which are a closed book to him and,
in particular, that he should become a speaking subject. The tacit cogito
is a cogito only when it has found expression for itself.
Such formulations may appear puzzling: if ultimate subjectivity cannot think of itself the moment it exists, how can it ever do so? How can
that which does not think take to doing so? And is not subjectivity
made to amount to a thing or a force which produces its eﬀects without being capable of knowing it? We do not mean that the primordial I
completely overlooks itself. If it did, it would indeed be a thing, and
nothing could cause it subsequently to become consciousness. We have
merely withheld from it objective thought, a positing consciousness of
the world and of itself. What do we mean by this? Either these words
mean nothing at all, or else they mean that we refrain from assuming
an explicit consciousness which duplicates and sustains the confused
grasp of primary subjectivity upon itself and upon its world. My vision,

the cogito

for example, is certainly ‘thinking that I see’, if we mean thereby that it
is not simply a bodily function like digestion or respiration, a collection of processes so grouped as to have a signiﬁcance in a larger system,
but that it is itself that system and that signiﬁcance, that anteriority of
the future to the present, of the whole to its parts. There is vision only
through anticipation and intention, and since no intention could be a
true intention if the object towards which it tends were given to it
ready made and with no motivation, it is true that all vision assumes in
the last resort, at the core of subjectivity, a total project or a logic of the
world which empirical perceptions endow with speciﬁc form, but to
which they cannot give rise. But vision is not thinking that one sees, if
we understand thereby that it itself links up with its object, and that it
becomes aware of itself as absolutely transparent, and as the originator
of its own presence in the visible world. The essential point is clearly to
grasp the project towards the world that we are. What we have said
above about the world’s being inseparable from our views of the world
should here help us to understand subjectivity conceived as inherence
in the world. There is no hylé, no sensation which is not in communication with other sensations or the sensations of other people, and for this
very reason there is no morphe, no apprehension or apperception, the oﬃce
of which is to give signiﬁcance to a matter that has none, and to ensure
the a priori unity of my experience, and experience shared with others.
Suppose that my friend Paul and I are looking at a landscape. What
precisely happens? Must it be said that we have both private sensations,
that we know things but cannot communicate them to each other—
that, as far as pure, lived-through experience goes, we are each
incarcerated in our separate perspectives—that the landscape is not
numerically the same for both of us and that it is a question only of a
speciﬁc identity? When I consider my perception itself, before any
objectifying reﬂection, at no moment am I aware of being shut up
within my own sensations. My friend Paul and I point out to each other
certain details of the landscape; and Paul’s ﬁnger, which is pointing out
the church tower, is not a ﬁnger-for-me that I think of as orientated
towards a church-tower-for-me, it is Paul’s ﬁnger which itself shows
me the tower that Paul sees, just as, conversely, when I make a movement towards some point in the landscape that I can see, I do not
imagine that I am producing in Paul, in virtue of some pre-established

471

472 phenomenology of perception
harmony, inner visions merely analogous to mine: I believe, on the
contrary, that my gestures invade Paul’s world and guide his gaze.
When I think of Paul, I do not think of a ﬂow of private sensations
indirectly related to mine through the medium of interposed signs, but
of someone who has a living experience of the same world as mine, as
well as the same history, and with whom I am in communication
through that world and that history. Are we to say, then, that what we
are concerned with is an ideal unity, that my world is the same as
Paul’s, just as the quadratic equation spoken of in Tokyo is the same as
the one spoken of in Paris, and that in short the ideal nature of the
world guarantees its intersubjective value? But ideal unity is not satisfactory either, for it exists no less between Mount Hymettus seen by the
ancient Greeks and the same mountain seen by me. Now it is no use my
telling myself, as I contemplate those russet mountain sides, that the
Greeks saw them too, for I cannot convince myself that they are the
same ones. On the other hand, Paul and I ‘together’ see this landscape,
we are jointly present in it, it is the same for both of us, not only as an
intelligible signiﬁcance, but as a certain accent of the world’s style,
down to its very thisness. The unity of the world crumbles and falls
asunder under the inﬂuence of that temporal and spatial distance
which the ideal unity traverses while remaining (in theory)
unimpaired. It is precisely because the landscape makes its impact upon
me and produces feelings in me, because it reaches me in my uniquely
individual being, because it is my own view of the landscape, that I
enjoy possession of the landscape itself, and the landscape for Paul as
well as for me. Both universality and the world lie at the core of individuality and the subject, and this will never be understood as long as
the world is made into an ob-ject. It is understood immediately if the
world is the ﬁeld of our experience, and if we are nothing but a view of
the world, for in that case it is seen that the most intimate vibration of
our psycho-physical being already announces the world, the quality
being the outline of a thing, and the thing the outline of the world. A
world which, as Malebranche puts it, never gets beyond being an
‘unﬁnished work’, or which, as Husserl says of the body, is ‘never
completely constituted’, does not require, and even rules out, a constituting subject. There must be, corresponding to this adumbration of
being which appears through the concordant aspects of my own

the cogito

experience, or of the experience I share with others—experience
which I presume capable of being consummated through indeﬁnite
horizons, from the sole fact that my phenomena congeal into a thing,
and display, as they occur, a certain consistency of style—there must
be, then, corresponding to this open unity of the world, an open and
indeﬁnite unity of subjectivity. Like the world’s unity, that of the I is
invoked rather than experienced each time I perform an act of perception, each time I reach a self-evident truth, and the universal I is the
background against which these eﬀulgent forms stand out: it is
through one present thought that I achieve the unity of all my
thoughts. What remains, on the hither side of my particular thoughts,
to constitute the tacit cogito and the original project towards the world,
and what, ultimately, am I in so far as I can catch a glimpse of myself
independently of any particular act? I am a ﬁeld, an experience. One
day, once and for all, something was set in motion which, even during
sleep, can no longer cease to see or not to see, to feel or not to feel, to
suﬀer or be happy, to think or rest from thinking, in a word to ‘have it
out’ with the world. There then arose, not a new set of sensations or
states of consciousness, not even a new monad or a new perspective,
since I am not tied to any one perspective but can change my point of
view, being under compulsion only in that I must always have one, and
can have only one at once—let us say, therefore, that there arose a fresh
possibility of situations. The event of my birth has not passed completely
away, it has not fallen into nothingness in the way that an event of the
objective world does, for it committed a whole future, not as a cause
determines its eﬀect, but as a situation, once created, inevitably leads
on to some outcome. There was henceforth a new ‘setting’, the world
received a fresh layer of meaning. In the home into which a child is
born, all objects change their signiﬁcance; they begin to await some as
yet indeterminate treatment at his hands; another and diﬀerent person
is there, a new personal history, short or long, has just been initiated,
another account has been opened. My ﬁrst perception, along with the
horizons which surrounded it, is an ever-present event, an unforgettable tradition; even as a thinking subject, I still am that ﬁrst perception,
the continuation of that same life inaugurated by it. In one sense, there
are no more acts of consciousness or distinct Erlebnisse in a life than
there are separate things in the world. Just as, as we have seen, when I

473

474 phenomenology of perception
walk round an object, I am not presented with a succession of perspective views which I subsequently co-ordinate thanks to the idea of one
single ﬂat projection, there being merely a certain amount of ‘shift’ in
the thing which, in itself, is journeying through time, so I am not
myself a succession of ‘psychic’ acts, nor for that matter a nuclear I
who bring them together into a synthetic unity, but one single experience inseparable from itself, one single ‘living cohesion’,35 one single
temporality which is engaged, from birth, in making itself progressively explicit, and in conﬁrming that cohesion in each successive present. It is this advent or again this transcendental event that the cogito
retrieves. The primary truth is indeed ‘I think’, but only provided that
we understand thereby ‘I belong to myself’36 while belonging to the
world. When we try to go deeper into subjectivity, calling all things
into question and suspending all our beliefs, the only form in which a
glimpse is vouchsafed to us of that non-human ground through which,
in the words of Rimbaud, ‘we are not of the world’, is as the horizon of
our particular commitments, and as the potentiality of something in
the most general sense, which is the world’s phantom. Inside and
outside are inseparable. The world is wholly inside and I am wholly
outside myself. When I perceive this table, the perception of the top
must not overlook that of the legs, otherwise the object would be
thrown out of joint. When I hear a melody, each of its moments must
be related to its successor, otherwise there would be no melody. Yet the
table is there with its external parts, and succession is of the essence of
melody. The act which draws together at the same time takes away and
holds at a distance, so that I touch myself only by escaping from myself.
In one of his celebrated pensées, Pascal shows that in one way I understand the world, and in another it understands me. We must add that it
is in the same way: I understand the world because there are for me
things near and far, foregrounds and horizons, and because in this way
it forms a picture and acquires signiﬁcance before me, and this ﬁnally is
because I am situated in it and it understands me. We do not say that
the notion of the world is inseparable from that of the subject, or that the
subject thinks himself inseparable from the idea of his body and the idea
35
36

Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, pp. 124–5.

the cogito

of the world; for, if it were a matter of no more than a conceived
relationship, it would ipso facto leave the absolute independence of the
subject as thinker intact, and the subject would not be in a situation. If
the subject is in a situation, even if he is no more than a possibility of
situations, this is because he forces his ipseity into reality only by
actually being a body, and entering the world through that body. In so
far as, when I reﬂect on the essence of subjectivity, I ﬁnd it bound up
with that of the body and that of the world, this is because my existence as subjectivity is merely one with my existence as a body and with
the existence of the world, and because the subject that I am, when
taken concretely, is inseparable from this body and this world. The
ontological world and body which we ﬁnd at the core of the subject are
not the world or body as idea, but on the one hand the world itself
contracted into a comprehensive grasp, and on the other the body
itself as a knowing-body.
But, it will be asked, if the unity of the world is not based on that of
consciousness, and if the world is not the outcome of a constituting
eﬀort, how does it come about that appearances accord with each other
and group themselves together into things, ideas and truths? And why
do our random thoughts, the events of our life and those of collective
history, at least at certain times assume common signiﬁcance and direction, and allow themselves to be subsumed under one idea? Why does
my life succeed in drawing itself together in order to project itself in
words, intentions and acts? This is the problem of rationality. The
reader is aware that, on the whole, classical thought tries to explain the
concordances in question in terms of a world in itself, or in terms of an
absolute mind. Such explanations borrow all the forces of conviction
which they can carry from the phenomenon of rationality, and therefore fail to explain that phenomenon, or ever to achieve greater clarity
than it possesses. Absolute Thought is no clearer to me than my own
ﬁnite mind, since it is through the latter that I conceive the former. We
are in the world, which means that things take shape, an immense
individual asserts itself, each existence is self-comprehensive and comprehensive of the rest. All that has to be done is to recognize these
phenomena which are the ground of all our certainties. The belief in an
absolute mind, or in a world in itself detached from us is no more than
a rationalization of this primordial faith.

TEMPORALITY
Le temps est le sens de la vie (sens: comme on dit le sens d’un
cours d’eau, le sens d’une phrase, le sens d’une étoffe, le sens
de l’odorat).
Claudel, Art Poétique.
Der Sinn des Daseins ist die Zeitlichkeit.
Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, p. 331.

In so far as, in the preceding pages, we have already met time on our
way to subjectivity, this is primarily because all our experiences, inasmuch as they are ours, arrange themselves in terms of before and after,
because temporality, in Kantian language, is the form taken by our
inner sense, and because it is the most general characteristic of ‘psychic
facts’. But in reality, and without prejudging what the analysis of time
will disclose, we have already discovered, between time and subjectivity, a much more intimate relationship. We have just seen that the
subject, who cannot be a series of psychic events, nevertheless cannot
be eternal either. It remains for him to be temporal not by reason of
some vagary of the human make-up, but by virtue of an inner necessity.
We are called upon to conceive the subject and time as communicating
from within. We can now say of temporality what we said earlier about

temporality

sexuality and spatiality, for example: existence can have no external or
contingent attribute. It cannot be anything—spatial, sexual, temporal—
without being so in its entirety, without taking up and carrying forward its ‘attributes’ and making them into so many dimensions of its
being, with the result that an analysis of any one of them that is at all
searching really touches upon subjectivity itself. There are no principal
and subordinate problems: all problems are concentric. To analyse time
is not to follow out the consequences of a pre-established conception of
subjectivity, it is to gain access, through time, to its concrete structure.
If we succeed in understanding the subject, it will not be in its pure
form, but by seeking it at the intersection of its dimensions. We need,
therefore, to consider time itself, and it is by following through its
internal dialectic that we shall be led to revise our idea of the subject.
We say that time passes or ﬂows by. We speak of the course of time.
The water that I see rolling by was made ready a few days ago in the
mountains, with the melting of the glacier; it is now in front of me and
makes its way towards the sea into which it will ﬁnally discharge itself.
If time is similar to a river, it ﬂows from the past towards the present
and the future. The present is the consequence of the past, and the
future of the present. But this often repeated metaphor is in reality
extremely confused. For, looking at the things themselves, the melting of the
snows and what results from this are not successive events, or rather
the very notion of event has no place in the objective world. When I say
that the day before yesterday the glacier produced the water which is
passing at this moment, I am tacitly assuming the existence of a witness
tied to a certain spot in the world, and I am comparing his successive
views: he was there when the snows melted and followed the water
down, or else, from the edge of the river and having waited two days,
he sees the pieces of wood that he threw into the water at its source.
The ‘events’ are shapes cut out by a ﬁnite observer from the spatiotemporal totality of the objective world. But on the other hand, if I
consider the world itself, there is simply one indivisible and changeless
being in it. Change presupposes a certain position which I take up and
from which I see things in procession before me: there are no events
without someone to whom they happen and whose ﬁnite perspective
is the basis of their individuality. Time presupposes a view of time. It is,
therefore, not like a river, not a ﬂowing substance. The fact that the

477

478 phenomenology of perception
metaphor based on this comparison has persisted from the time of
Heraclitus to our own day is explained by our surreptitiously putting
into the river a witness of its course. We do this already when we say
that the stream discharges itself, for this amounts to conceiving, where
there is merely a thing entirely external to itself, an individuality or
interior of the stream which manifests itself outside. Now, no sooner
have I introduced an observer, whether he follows the river or whether
he stands on the bank and observes its ﬂow, than temporal relationships
are reversed. In the latter case, the volume of water already carried by is
not moving towards the future, but sinking into the past; what is to
come is on the side of the source, for time does not come from the
past. It is not the past that pushes the present, nor the present that
pushes the future, into being; the future is not prepared behind the
observer, it is a brooding presence moving to meet him, like a storm on
the horizon. If the observer sits in a boat and is carried by the current,
we may say that he is moving downstream towards his future, but the
future lies in the new landscapes which await him at the estuary, and
the course of time is no longer the stream itself: it is the landscape as it
rolls by for the moving observer. Time is, therefore, not a real process,
not an actual succession that I am content to record. It arises from my
relation to things. Within things themselves, the future and the past are
in a kind of eternal state of pre-existence and survival; the water which
will ﬂow by tomorrow is at this moment at its source, the water
which has just passed is now a little further downstream in the valley.
What is past or future for me is present in the world. It is often said
that, within things themselves, the future is not yet, the past is no
longer, while the present, strictly speaking, is inﬁnitesimal, so that time
collapses. That is why Leibnitz was able to deﬁne the objective world as
mens momentanea, and why Saint Augustine, in order to constitute time,
required, besides the presence of the present, a presence of the past and
of the future. But let us be clear about what they mean. If the objective
world is incapable of sustaining time, it is not because it is in some way
too narrow, and that we need to add to it a bit of past and a bit of
future. Past and future exist only too unmistakably in the world, they
exist in the present, and what being itself lacks in order to be of the
temporal order, is the not-being of elsewhere, formerly and tomorrow.
The objective world is too much of a plenum for there to be time. Past

temporality

and future withdraw of their own accord from being and move over
into subjectivity in search, not of some real support, but, on the contrary, of a possibility of not-being which accords with their nature. If
we separate the objective world from the ﬁnite perspectives which
open upon it, and posit it in itself, we ﬁnd everywhere in it only so
many instances of ‘now’. These instances of ‘now’, moreover, not
being present to anybody, have no temporal character and could not
occur in sequence. The deﬁnition of time which is implicit in the
comparisons undertaken by common sense, and which might be formulated as ‘a succession of instances of now’1 has not even the disadvantage of treating past and future as presents: it is inconsistent, since it
destroys the very notion of ‘now’, and that of succession.
We should, then, gain nothing by transferring into ourselves the
time that belongs to things, if we repeated ‘in consciousness’ the mistake of deﬁning it as a succession of instances of now. Yet this is what
psychologists do when they try to ‘explain’ consciousness of the past
in terms of memories, and consciousness of the future in terms of the
projection of these memories ahead of us. The refutation of ‘physiological theories’ of memory, in Bergson for example, is undertaken in
the domain of causal explanation; it consists in showing that paths in
the brain and other bodily expedients are not adequate causes of the
phenomena of memory; that, for example, nothing can be found in the
body to account for the order of disappearance of memories in cases of
progressive aphasia. The discussion conducted on these lines certainly
discredits the idea of a bodily storage of the past: the body is no longer
a receptacle of engrams, but an organ of mimicry with the function of
ensuring the intuitive realization of the ‘intentions’2 of consciousness.
But these intentions cling on to memories preserved ‘in the
unconscious’, and the presence of the past in consciousness remains a
simple factual presence; it has passed unnoticed that our best reason for
rejecting the physiological preservation of the past is equally a reason
for rejecting its ‘psychological preservation’, and that reason is that no
preservation, no physiological or psychic ‘trace’ of the past can make
consciousness of the past understandable. This table bears traces of my

479

480 phenomenology of perception
past life, for I have carved my initials on it and spilt ink on it. But these
traces in themselves do not refer to the past: they are present; and, in so
far as I ﬁnd in them signs of some ‘previous’ event, it is because I derive
my sense of the past from elsewhere, because I carry this particular
signiﬁcance within myself. If my brain stores up traces of the bodily
process which accompanied one of my perceptions, and if the
appropriate nervous inﬂux passes once more through these already
fretted channels, my perception will reappear, but it will be a fresh
perception, weakened and unreal perhaps, but in no case will this
perception, which is present, be capable of pointing to a past event,
unless I have some other viewpoint on my past enabling me to recognize it as memory, which runs counter to the hypothesis. If we now go
on to substitute ‘psychic traces’ for physiological ones, and if our
perceptions are preserved in an unconscious, the diﬃculty will be the
same as before: a preserved perception is a perception, it continues to
exist, it persists in the present, and it does not open behind us that
dimension of escape and absence that we call the past. A preserved
fragment of the lived-through past can be at the most no more than an
occasion for thinking of the past, but it is not the past which is compelling recognition; recognition, when we try to derive it from any
content whatever, always precedes itself. Reproduction presupposes recognition, and cannot be understood as such unless I have in the ﬁrst
place a sort of direct contact with the past in its own domain. Nor can
one, a fortiori, construct the future out of contents of consciousness: no
actual content can be taken, even equivocally, as evidence concerning
the future, since the future has not even been in existence and cannot,
like the past, set its mark upon us. The only conceivable way, therefore,
of trying to explain the relation of future to present would be by
putting it on the same footing as that between present and past. When I
consider the long procession of my past states, I see that my present is
always passing, and I can steal this passage, treat my immediate past as a
remote one, and my actual present as past: ahead of it is then a vacuum,
and this is the future. Looking ahead would seem in reality to be
retrospection, and the future a projection of the past. But even if, per
impossible, I could construct consciousness of the past with transferred
presents, they certainly could not open a future for me. Even if, in fact,
we form an idea of the future with the help of what we have seen, the

temporality

fact remains that, in order to pro-ject it ahead of us, we need in the ﬁrst
place a sense of the future. If prospection is retrospection, it is in any
case an anticipatory retrospection, and how could one anticipate if one
had no sense of the future? It is said that we guess ‘by analogy’ that this
inimitable present will, like all the others, pass away. But for there to be
an analogy between presents that have elapsed and the actual present,
the latter must be given not only as present, it must already announce
itself as what will soon be past, we must feel the pressure upon it of a
future intent on dispossessing it; in short the course of time must be
primarily not only the passing of present to past, but also that of the
future to the present. If it can be said that all prospection is anticipatory
retrospection, it can equally well be said that all retrospection is
prospection in reverse: I know that I was in Corsica before the war,
because I know that the war was on the horizon of my trip there. The
past and the future cannot be mere concepts abstracted by us from our
perceptions and recollections, mere denominations for the actual series
of ‘psychic facts’. Time is thought of by us before its parts, and temporal relations make possible the events in time. Correspondingly,
therefore, the subject must not be himself situated in it, in order to be
able to be present in intention to the past as to the future. Let us no
longer say that time is a ‘datum of consciousness’; let us be more
precise and say that consciousness deploys or constitutes time. Through
the ideal nature of time, it ceases to be imprisoned in the present.
But does it enjoy an opening on to a past and a future? It is no longer
beset by the present and by ‘contents’ it travels freely from a past and a
future which are not far removed from it, since it constitutes them as
past and future, and since they are its immanent objects, to a present
which is not near to it, since it is present only in virtue of the relations
which consciousness establishes between past, present and future. But
then has not a consciousness thus freed lost all notion of what future,
past and even present can possibly be? Is not the time that it constitutes
similar in every detail to the real time the impossibility of which we
have demonstrated; is it not a series of instances of ‘now’, which are
presented to nobody, since nobody is involved in them? Are we not still
just as far away from understanding what the future, the past and the
present, and the passage between them, can possibly be? Time as the
immanent object of a consciousness is time brought down to one

481

482 phenomenology of perception
uniform level, in other words it is no longer time at all. There can be
time only if it is not completely deployed, only provided that past,
present and future do not all three have their being in the same sense. It
is of the essence of time to be in process of self-production, and not to
be; never, that is, to be completely constituted. Constituted time, the
series of possible relations in terms of before and after, is not time
itself, but the ultimate recording of time, the result of its passage, which
objective thinking always presupposes yet never manages to fasten on
to. It is spatial, since its moments co-exist spread out before thought3; it
is a present, because consciousness is contemporary with all times. It is
a setting distinct from me and unchanging, in which nothing either
elapses or happens. There must be another true time, in which I learn
the nature of ﬂux and transiènce itself. It is indeed true that I should be
incapable of perceiving any point in time without a before and an after,
and that, in order to be aware of the relationship between the three
terms, I must not be absorbed into any one of them: that time, in short,
needs a synthesis. But it is equally true that this synthesis must always
be undertaken afresh, and that any supposition that it can be anywhere
brought to completion involves the negation of time. It is indeed the
dream of philosophers to be able to conceive an ‘eternity of life’, lying
beyond permanence and change, in which time’s productivity is preeminently contained, and yet a thetic consciousness of time which
stands above it and embraces it merely destroys the phenomenon of
time. If we are in fact destined to make contact with a sort of eternity, it
will be at the core of our experience of time, and not in some nontemporal subject whose function it is to conceive and posit it. The
problem is how to make time explicit as it comes into being and makes
3

In order to arrive at authentic time, it is neither necessary nor suﬃcient to condemn the
spatialization of time as does Bergson. It is not necessary, since time is exclusive of space
only if we consider space as objectiﬁed in advance, and ignore that primordial spatiality
which we have tried to describe, and which is the abstract form of our presence in the
world. It is not suﬃcient since, even when the systematic translation of time into spatial
terms has been duly stigmatized, we may still fall very far short of an authentic intuition
of time. This is what happened to Bergson. When he says that duration ‘snowballs upon
itself ’, and when he postulates memories in themselves accumulating in the
unconscious, he makes time out of a preserved present, and evolution out of what is
evolved.

temporality

itself evident, time at all times underlying the notion of time, not as an
object of our knowledge, but as a dimension of our being.
It is in my ‘ﬁeld of presence’ in the widest sense—this moment that
that I spend working, with, behind it, the horizon of the day that has
elapsed, and, in front of it, the evening and night—that I make contact
with time, and learn to know its course. The remote past has also its
temporal order, and its position in time in relation to my present, but it
has these in so far as it has been present itself, that it has been ‘in its
time’ traversed by my life, and carried forward to this moment. When I
call up a remote past, I reopen time, and carry myself back to a moment
in which it still had before it a future horizon now closed, and a
horizon of the immediate past which is today remote. Everything,
therefore, causes me to revert to the ﬁeld of presence as the primary
experience in which time and its dimensions make their appearance
unalloyed, with no intervening distance and with absolute selfevidence. It is here that we see a future sliding into the present and on
into the past. Nor are these three dimensions given to us through
discrete acts: I do not form a mental picture of my day, it weighs upon
me with all its weight, it is still there, and though I may not recall any
detail of it, I have the impending power to do so, I still ‘have it in
hand’.4 In the same way, I do not think of the evening to come and its
consequences, and yet it ‘is there’, like the back of a house of which I
can see only the façade, or like the background beneath a ﬁgure. Our
future is not made up exclusively of guesswork and daydreams. Ahead
of what I see and perceive, there is, it is true, nothing more actually
visible, but my world is carried forward by lines of intentionality
which trace out in advance at least the style of what is to come
(although we are always on the watch, perhaps to the day of our death,
for the appearance of something else). The present itself, in the narrow
sense, is not posited. The paper, my fountain-pen, are indeed there for
me, but I do not explicitly perceive them. I do not so much perceive
objects as reckon with an environment; I seek support in my tools, and
am at my task rather than confronting it. Husserl uses the terms protections and retentions for the intentionalities which anchor me to an

484 phenomenology of perception
environment. They do not run from a central I, but from my perceptual
ﬁeld itself, so to speak, which draws along in its wake its own horizon
of retentions, and bites into the future with its protections. I do not
pass through a series of instances of now, the images of which I preserve and which, placed end to end, make a line. With the arrival of
every moment, its predecessor undergoes a change: I still have it in
hand and it is still there, but already it is sinking away below the level of
presents; in order to retain it, I need to reach through a thin layer of
time. It is still the preceding moment, and I have the power to rejoin it
as it was just now; I am not cut oﬀ from it, but still it would not belong
to the past unless something had altered, unless it were beginning to
outline itself against, or project itself upon, my present, whereas a
moment ago it was my present. When a third moment arrives, the
second undergoes a new modiﬁcation; from being a retention it
becomes the retention of a retention, and the layer of time between it
and me thickens. One can, as Husserl does, represent this phenomenon
diagrammatically. In order to make it complete, the symmetrical perspective of protections would have to be added. Time is not a line, but a
network of intentionalities.

From Husserl (Zeitbewusstsein, p. 22). Horizontal line: series of ‘present
moments’. Oblique lines: Abschattungen of the same ‘present moments’
seen from an ulterior ‘present moment’. Vertical lines: Successive
Abschattungen of one and the same ‘present moment’.

It will doubtless be maintained that this description and this diagram
do not bring us one step nearer to a solution. When we pass from A to
B, and then on to C, A is projected or outlined as A′ and then as A″. For
A′ to be recognized as a retention or Abschattung of A, and A″ of A′, and

temporality

even for the transformation of A into A′ to be experienced as such, is
there not needed an identifying synthesis linking A, A′, A″ and all other
possible Abschattungen, and does this not amount to making A into an
ideal unity as Kant requires? And yet we know that with this intellectual synthesis there will cease to be any time at all. A and all previous
moments of time will indeed be identiﬁable by me, and I shall be in a
way rescued from time which runs them into one another and blurs
their identity. But at the same time I shall have lost all sense of before
and after which is provided by this ﬂux, and nothing will any longer
serve to distinguish the temporal sequence from spatial multiplicity.
Husserl introduced the notion of retention, and held that I still have the
immediate past in hand, precisely for the purpose of conveying that I
do not posit the past, or construct it from an Abschattung really distinct
from it and by means of an express act; but that I reach it in its recent,
yet already elapsed, thisness. What is given to me is not in the ﬁrst place
A′, A″, or A′′′, nor do I go back from these ‘outlines’ to their original A,
as one goes back from the sign to its signiﬁcance. What is given to me
is A transparently visible through A′, then the two through A″, and so
on, as I see a pebble through the mass of water which moves over it.
There are certainly identifying syntheses, but only in the express memory and voluntary recollection of the remote past, that is, in those
modes derived from consciousness of the past. For example, I may be
uncertain about the date of a memory: I have before me a certain scene,
let us suppose, and I do not know to what point of time to assign it, the
memory has lost its anchorage, and I may then arrive at an intellectual
identiﬁcation based on the causal order of events, for example, I had
this suit made before the armistice, since no more English cloth has
been available since then. But in this case it is not the past itself that I
reach. On the contrary, for when I rediscover the concrete origin of the
memory, it is because it falls naturally into a certain current of fear and
hope running from Munich to the outbreak of war; it is, therefore,
because I recapture time that is lost; because, from the moment in
question to my present, the chain of retentions and the overlapping
horizons coming one after the other ensure an unbroken continuity.
The objective landmarks in relation to which I assign a place to my
recollection in the mediatory identiﬁcation, and the intellectual synthesis generally, have themselves a temporal signiﬁcance only because

485

486 phenomenology of perception
gradually, step by step, the synthesis of apprehension links me to my
whole actual past. There can, therefore, be no question of assimilating
the latter to the former. The fact that the Abschattungen A′ and A″ appear
to me as Abschattungen of A, is not to be explained by the fact that they
all participate in an ideal unity A which is their common ground. It is
because through them I obtain the point A itself, in its unchallengeable individuality, which is for ever established by its passage into the
present, and because I see springing from it the Abschattungen A′, A″ . . .
In Husserl’s language, beneath the ‘intentionality of the act’, which is
the thetic consciousness of an object, and which, in intellectual memory for example, converts ‘this’ into an idea, we must recognize an
‘operative’ intentionality (fungierende Intentionalität)5 which makes the
former possible, and which is what Heidegger terms transcendence.
My present outruns itself in the direction of an immediate future and
an immediate past and impinges upon them where they actually are,
namely in the past and in the future themselves. If the past were
available to us only in the form of express recollections, we should be
continually tempted to recall it in order to verify its existence, and
thus resemble the patient mentioned by Scheler, who was constantly
turning round in order to reassure himself that things were really
there—whereas in fact we feel it behind us as an incontestable acquisition. In order to have a past or a future we do not have to bring
together, by means of an intellectual act, a series of Abschattungen, for
they possess a natural and primordial unity, and what is announced
through them is the past or the future itself. Such is the paradox of
what might be termed, with Husserl, the ‘passive synthesis’ of
time6—and of a term which is clearly not a solution, but merely a
pointer to the problem.
Light begins to be shed on the problem if we remember that our
diagram represents an instantaneous cross-section of time. What there
really is, is not a past, present and future, not discrete instants A, B and
C, nor really distinct Abschattungen A′, A″, B′, nor ﬁnally a host of retentions on the one hand and protections on the other. The upsurge of a

temporality

fresh present does not cause a heaping up of the past and a tremor of the
future; the fresh present is the passage of future to present, and of
former present to past, and when time begins to move, it moves
throughout its whole length. The ‘instants’ A, B and C are not successively in being, but diﬀerentiate themselves from each other, and correspondingly A passes into A′ and thence into A″. In short, the system
of retentions collects into itself at each instant what was, an instant
earlier, the system of protentions. There is, then, not a multiplicity of
linked phenomena, but one single phenomenon of running-oﬀ. Time
is the one single movement appropriate to itself in all its parts, as a
gesture includes all the muscular contractions necessary for its execution. When we pass from B to C, there is, as it were, a bursting, or a
disintegration of B into B′, of A′ into A″, and C itself which, while it
was on the way, announced its coming by a continuous emission of
Abschattungen, has no sooner come into existence than it already begins
to lose its substance. ‘Time is the means oﬀered to all that is destined to
be, to come into existence in order that it may no longer be.’7 It is
nothing but a general ﬂight out of the Itself, the one law governing
these centrifugal movements, or again, as Heidegger says, an ek-stase.
While B becomes C, it becomes also B′; and simultaneously A which,
while becoming B, had also become A′, lapses into A″. A, A′ and A″ on
the one hand, and B and B′ on the other, are bound together, not by any
identifying synthesis, which would ﬁx them at a point in time, but by a
transition-synthesis (Übergangssynthesis), in so far as they issue one from
the other, and each of these projections is merely one aspect of the total
bursting forth or dehiscence. Hence time, in our primordial experience
of it, is not for us a system of objective positions, through which we
pass, but a mobile setting which moves away from us, like the landscape seen through a railway carriage window. Yet we do not really
believe that the landscape is moving; the gate-keeper at the level crossing is whisked by, but the hill over there scarcely moves at all, and in
the same way, though the opening of my day is already receding, the
beginning of my week is a ﬁxed point; an objective time is taking shape
on the horizon, and should therefore show up in my immediate past.
How is this possible? How is it that the temporal ek-stase is not an

488 phenomenology of perception
absolute disintegration in which the individuality of the moments disappears? It is because the disintegration undoes what the passage from
future to present had achieved: C is the culmination of a long concentration which has brought it to maturity; as it was being built up, it
made its approach known by progressively fewer Abschattungen, for it was
approaching bodily. When it came into the present it brought with it its
genesis, of which it was merely the ultimate expression, and the
impending presence of what was to come after it. So that, when D
comes into being and pushes C into the past, C is not suddenly bereft of
its being; its disintegration is forever the inverse or the consequence of
its coming to maturity. In short, since in time being and passing are
synonymous, by becoming past, the event does not cease to be. The
origin of objective time, with its ﬁxed positions lying beneath our
gaze, is not to be sought in any eternal synthesis, but in the mutual
harmonizing and overlapping of past and future through the present,
and in the very passing of time. Time maintains what it has caused to
be, at the very time it expels it from being, because the new being was
announced by its predecessor as destined to be, and because, for the
latter, to become present was the same thing as being destined to pass
away. ‘Temporalization is not a succession (Nacheinander) of ecstasies.
The future is not posterior to the past, or the past anterior to the
present. Temporality temporalizes itself as future-which-lapses-intothe-past-by-coming-into-the-present.’8 Bergson was wrong in explaining
the unity of time in terms of its continuity, since that amounts to
confusing past, present and future on the excuse that we pass from one
to the other by imperceptible transitions; in short, it amounts to denying time altogether. But he was right to stick to the continuity of time
as an essential phenomenon. It is simply a matter of elucidating this.
Instant C and instant D, however near they are together, are not indistinguishable, for if they were there would be no time; what happens is
that they run into each other and C becomes D because C has never
been anything but the anticipation of D as present, and of its own lapse
into the past. This amounts to saying that each present reasserts the
presence of the whole past which it supplants, and anticipates that of
all that is to come, and that by deﬁnition the present is not shut up
8

within itself, but transcends itself towards a future and a past. What
there is, is not a present, then another present which takes its place in
being, and not even a present with its vistas of past and future followed
by another present in which those vistas are disrupted, so that one and
the same spectator is needed to eﬀect the synthesis of successive perspectives: there is one single time which is self-conﬁrmatory, which
can bring nothing into existence unless it has already laid that thing’s
foundations as present and eventual past, and which establishes itself at
a stroke.
The past, therefore, is not past, nor the future future. It exists only
when a subjectivity is there to disrupt the plenitude of being in itself,
to adumbrate a perspective, and introduce non-being into it. A past and
a future spring forth when I reach out towards them. I am not, for
myself, at this very moment, I am also at this morning or at the night
which will soon be here, and though my present is, if we wish so to
consider it, this instant, it is equally this day, this year or my whole life.
There is no need for a synthesis externally binding together the tempora
into one single time, because each one of the tempora was already inclusive, beyond itself, of the whole open series of other tempora, being in
internal communication with them, and because the ‘cohesion of a
life’9 is given with its ek-stase. The passage of one present to the next is
not a thing which I conceive, nor do I see it as an onlooker, I eﬀect it; I
am already at the impending present as my gesture is already at its goal,
I am myself time, a time which ‘abides’ and does not ‘ﬂow’ or
‘change’, which is what Kant says in various places.10 This idea of a
time which anticipates itself is perceived by common sense in its way.
Everyone talks about Time, not as the zoologist talks about the dog or
the horse, using these as collective nouns, but using it as a proper noun.
Sometimes it is even personiﬁed. Everyone thinks that there is here a
single, concrete being, wholly present in each of its manifestations, as
is a man in each of his spoken words. We say that there is time as we say
that there is a fountain: the water changes while the fountain remains
because its form is preserved; the form is preserved because each successive wave takes over the functions of its predecessor: from being the

490 phenomenology of perception
thrusting wave in relation to the one in front of it, it becomes, in its
turn and in relation to another, the wave that is pushed; and this is
attributable to the fact that, from the source to the fountain jet, the
waves are not separate; there is only one thrust, and a single air-lock in
the ﬂow would be enough to break up the jet. Hence the justiﬁcation
for the metaphor of the river, not in so far as the river ﬂows, but in so
far as it is one with itself. This intuition of time’s permanence, however,
is jeopardized by the action of common sense, which thematizes or
objectiﬁes it, which is the surest way of losing sight of it. There is more
truth in mythical personiﬁcations of time than in the notion of time
considered, in the scientiﬁc manner, as a variable of nature in itself, or,
in the Kantian manner, as a form ideally separable from its matter.
There is a temporal style of the world, and time remains the same
because the past is a former future and a recent present, the present an
impending past and a recent future, the future a present and even a past
to come; because, that is, each dimension of time is treated or aimed at
as something other than itself and because, ﬁnally, there is at the core of
time a gaze, or, as Heidegger puts it, an Augen-blick, someone through
whom the word as can have a meaning. We are not saying that time is for
someone, which would once more be a case of arraying it out, and
immobilizing it. We are saying that time is someone, or that temporal
dimensions, in so far as they perpetually overlap, bear each other out
and ever conﬁne themselves to making explicit what was implied in
each, being collectively expressive of that one single explosion or
thrust which is subjectivity itself. We must understand time as the
subject and the subject as time. What is perfectly clear, is that this
primordial temporality is not a juxtaposition of external events, since it
is the power which holds them together while keeping them apart.
Ultimate subjectivity is not temporal in the empirical sense of the term:
if consciousness of time were made up of successive states of
consciousness, there would be needed a new consciousness to be
conscious of that succession and so on to inﬁnity. We are forced to
recognize the existence of ‘a consciousness having behind it no consciousness to be conscious of it’11 which consequently, is not arrayed
11

Husserl, Zeitbewusstsein, p. 442; ‘primäres Bewusstsein . . . das hinter sich kein
Bewusstsein mehr hat in dem es bewusst wäre . . .’

temporality

out in time, and in which ‘being coincides with being for itself ’.12 We
may say that ultimate consciousness is ‘timeless’ (zeitlose) in the sense
that it is not intratemporal.13 ‘In’ my present, if I grasp it while it is still
living and with all that it implies, there is an ek-stase towards the future
and towards the past which reveals the dimensions of time not as
conﬂicting, but as inseparable: to be now is to be from always and for
ever. Subjectivity is not in time, because it takes up or lives time, and
merges with the cohesion of a life.
Are we coming back in this way to a kind of eternity? I belong to my
past and, through the constant interlocking of retentions, I preserve my
oldest experiences, which means not some duplicate or image of them,
but the experiences themselves, exactly as they were. But the unbroken
chain of the ﬁelds of presence, by which I am guaranteed access to the
past itself, has the essential characteristic of being formed only gradually and one step at a time; each present, in virtue of its very essence as
a present, rules out the juxtaposition of other presents and, even in the
context of a time long past, I can take in a certain period of my past life
only by unfolding it anew according to its own tempo. The temporal
perspective with its confusion of what is far removed in time, and that
sort of ‘shrinkage’ of the past with oblivion as its ultimate limit, are not
accidents of memory, and do not express the debasement into empirical existence of a consciousness of time theoretically all-embracing,
but its initial ambiguity: to retain is to hold, but at a distance. Once
again, time’s ‘synthesis’ is a transition-synthesis, the action of a life
which unfolds, and there is no way of bringing it about other than by
living that life, there is no seat of time; time bears itself on and launches
itself afresh. Time as an indivisible thrust and transition can alone make
possible time as successive multiplicity, and what we place at the origin
of intratemporality is a constituting time. When we were engaged
above in describing the overlapping of time by itself, we were able to
treat the future as a past only by qualifying it as a past to come, and the
past as a future only by calling it a future which has occurred;
this means that when we came to put all time on the same footing, we
had to reassert the originality of each perspective, and derive this

quasi-eternity from the event. What does not pass in time is the passing
of time itself. Time restarts itself: the rhythmic cycle and constant form
of yesterday, today and tomorrow may well create the illusion that we
possess it immediately, in its entirety, as the fountain creates in us a
feeling of eternity. But the generality of time is no more than one of its
secondary attributes and provides only an inauthentic view of it, since
we cannot get as far as conceiving a cycle without drawing a distinction, in terms of time, between the point of arrival and the point of
departure. The feeling for eternity is a hypocritical one, for eternity
feeds on time. The fountain retains its identity only because of the
continuous pressure of water. Eternity is the time that belongs to
dreaming, and the dream refers back to waking life, from which it
borrows all its structures. Of what nature, then, is that waking time in
which eternity takes root? It is the ﬁeld of presence in the wide sense,
with its double horizon or primary past and future, and the inﬁnite
openness of those ﬁelds of presence that have slid by, or are still possible. Time exists for me only because I am situated in it, that is,
because I become aware of myself as already committed to it, because
the whole of being is not given to me incarnate, and ﬁnally because
one sector of being is so close to me that it does not even make up a
picture before me—I cannot see it, just as I cannot see my face. Time
exists for me because I have a present. It is by coming into the present
that a moment of time acquires that indestructible individuality, that
‘once and for all’ quality, which subsequently enables it to make its
way through time and produce in us the illusion of eternity. No one of
time’s dimensions can be deduced from the rest. But the present (in the
wide sense, along with its horizons of primary past and future), nevertheless enjoys a privilege because it is the zone in which being and
consciousness coincide. When I recall an earlier perception, or when I
imagine a visit to my friend Paul who is in Brazil, my aim, it is true, is
the past itself in its true place, or Paul himself in the world, and not
some interposed mental object. Nevertheless my act of representation,
unlike the experiences represented, is actually present to me; the former is perceived, the latter are merely represented. A former experience, a coming experience, in order that they may appear to me, need
to be borne into being by a primary consciousness, which in this case
is my inner perception of recollection or imagination. We said above

temporality

that we need to arrive at a consciousness with no other behind it,
which grasps its own being, and in which, in short, being and being
conscious are one and the same thing. This ultimate consciousness is
not an eternal subject perceiving itself in absolute transparency, for any
such subject would be utterly incapable of making its descent into
time, and would, therefore have nothing in common with our experience: it is the consciousness of the present. In the present and in
perception, my being and my consciousness are at one, not that my
being is reducible to the knowledge I have of it or that it is clearly set
out before me—on the contrary perception is opaque, for it brings into
play, beneath what I know, my sensory ﬁelds which are my primitive
alliance with the world—but because ‘to be conscious’ is here nothing
but ‘to-be-at . . .’ (‘être à . . .’), and because my consciousness of
existing merges into the actual gesture of ‘ex-sistence’.14 It is by communicating with the world that we communicate beyond all doubt
with ourselves. We hold time in its entirety, and we are present to
ourselves because we are present to the world.
That being the case, and since consciousness takes root in being and
time by taking up a situation, how are we then to describe it? It must be
a comprehensive project, or a view of time and the world which, in
order to be apparent to itself, and in order to become explicitly what it
is implicitly, that is, consciousness, needs to unfold itself into multiplicity. We must avoid conceiving as real and distinct entities either the
indivisible power, or its distinct manifestations; consciousness is neither, it is both; it is the very action of temporalization*—of ‘ﬂux’, as
Husserl has it—a self-anticipatory movement, a ﬂow which never
leaves itself. Let us try to give a better description with the help of an
example. The novelist or psychologist who fails to go back to ultimate
origins and accepts temporalization as something ready made, sees
consciousness as a multiplicity of psychic facts among which he tries
to establish causal relations. For example,15 Proust shows how Swann’s
love for Odette causes the jealousy which, in turn, modiﬁes his love, since
Swann, always anxious to win her from any possible rival, has no time
* Cf. ‘Zeitigung’ (Translator’s note).

really to look at Odette. In reality, Swann’s consciousness is not a
lifeless setting in which psychic facts are produced from outside. What
we have is not jealousy aroused by love and exerting its own counterinﬂuence, but a certain way of loving in which the whole destiny of
that love can be discerned at a glance. Swann has a liking for Odette’s
person, for that ‘spectacle’ that she is, for her way of looking, of modulating her voice, and for the way a smile comes to her lips. But what is
having a liking for someone? Proust tells us when speaking of another
love: it is the feeling of being shut out of the life of the beloved, and of
wanting to force one’s way in and take complete possession of it.
Swann’s love does not cause him to feel jealousy. It is jealousy already,
and has been from the start. Jealousy does not produce a change in the
quality of love: Swann’s feeling of pleasure in looking at Odette bore its
degeneration within itself, since it was the pleasure of being the only
one to do so. The set of psychic facts and casual relationships merely
translates in an external fashion a certain view that Swann takes of
Odette, a certain way of belonging to another. Swann’s jealous love
ought, moreover, to be related to the rest of his behaviour, in which
case it might well appear as itself a manifestation of an even more
general existential structure, which would be Swann’s whole personality. Conversely all consciousness as a comprehensive project is outlined
or made manifest to itself in those acts, experiences and ‘psychic facts’
in which it is recognized. Here is where temporality throws light on
subjectivity. We shall never manage to understand how a thinking or
constituting subject is able to posit or become aware of itself in time. If
the I is indeed the transcendental Ego of Kant, we shall never understand how it can in any instance merge with its wake in the inner sense,
or how the empirical self still remains a self. If, however, the subject is
identiﬁed with temporality, then self-positing ceases to be a contradiction, because it exactly expresses the essence of living time. Time is ‘the
aﬀecting of self by self ’;16 what exerts the eﬀect is time as a thrust and a
passing towards a future: what is aﬀected is time as an unfolded series
of presents: the aﬀecting agent and aﬀected recipient are one, because
16

The expression is applied by Kant to the Gemüt. Heidegger transfers it to time: ‘Die
Zeit is ihrem Wesen nach reine Aﬀektion ihrer selbst.’ Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik,
pp. 180–1.

temporality

the thrust of time is nothing but the transition from one present to
another. This ek-stase, this projection of an indivisible power into an
outcome which is already present to it, is subjectivity. The primary
ﬂow, says Husserl, does not conﬁne itself to being; it must necessarily
provide itself with a ‘manifestation of itself’ (Selbsterscheinung), without
our needing to place behind it a second ﬂow which is conscious of it. It
‘constitutes itself as a phenomenon within itself ’.17 It is of the essence
of time to be not only actual time, or time which ﬂows, but also time
which is aware of itself, for the explosion or dehiscence of the present
towards a future is the archetype of the relationship of self to self, and it
traces out an inferiority or ipseity.18 Here a light bursts forth,19 for here
we are no longer concerned with a being which reposes within itself,
but with a being the whole essence of which, like that of light, is to
make visible. It is through temporality that there can be, without contradiction, ipseity, signiﬁcance and reason. That is seen even in the commonly held notion of time. We mark out the phases or stages of our
life: for example, we consider everything that bears a signiﬁcant relationship to our concerns at the moment as part of our present, thus
recognizing implicitly that time and signiﬁcance are but one thing.
Subjectivity is not motionless identity with itself; as with time, it is of
its essence, in order to be genuine subjectivity, to open itself to an
Other and to go forth from itself. We must not envisage the subject as
constituting, and the multiplicity of its experiences or Erlebnisse as constituted: we must not treat the transcendental Ego as the true subject
and the empirical self as its shadow or its wake. If that were their
relationship to each other, we could withdraw into the constituting
agency, and such reﬂection would destroy time, which would be left
without date or place. The fact that even our purest reﬂection appears
to us as retrospective in time, and that our reﬂection on the ﬂux is
actually inserted into the ﬂux,20 shows that the most precise consciousness of which we are capable is always, as it were, aﬀected by itself or

given to itself, and that the word consciousness has no meaning
independently of this duality.
Nothing said of the subject is false: it is true that the subject as an
absolute presence to itself is rigorously indeclinable, and that nothing
could happen to it of which it did not bear within itself the lineaments.
It is also true that it provides itself with symbols of itself in both
succession and multiplicity, and that these symbols are it, since without
them it would, like an inarticulate cry, fail to achieve selfconsciousness.
It is here that what we provisionally termed the passive synthesis
becomes clariﬁed. A passive synthesis is a contradiction in terms if the
synthesis is a process of composition, and if the passivity consists in
being the recipient of multiplicity instead of its composer. What we
meant by passive synthesis was that we make our way into multiplicity,
but that we do not synthesize it. Now temporalization satisﬁes by its
very nature these two conditions: it is indeed clear that I am not the
creator of time any more than of my heart-beats. I am not the initiator
of the process of temporalization; I did not choose to come into the
world, yet once I am born, time ﬂows through me, whatever I do.
Nevertheless this ceaseless welling up of time is not a simple fact to
which I am passively subjected, for I can ﬁnd a remedy against it in
itself, as happens in a decision which binds me or in the act of establishing a concept. It withholds me from what I was about to become,
and at the same time provides me with the means of grasping myself at
a distance and establishing my own reality as myself. What is called
passivity is not the acceptance by us of an alien reality, or a causal
action exerted upon us from outside: it is being encompassed, being in
a situation—prior to which we do not exist—which we are perpetually
resuming and which is constitute of us. A spontaneity ‘acquired’ once
and for all, and one which ‘perpetuates itself in being in virtue of its
being acquired’21 is precisely time and subjectivity. It is time, since a
time without its roots in a present and thence a past would no longer
be time, but eternity. Heidegger’s historical time, which ﬂows from
the future and which, thanks to its resolute decision, has its future in
advance and rescues itself once and for all from disintegration, is
21

very idea of it.

temporality

impossible within the context of Heidegger’s thought itself: for, if time
is an ek-stase, if present and past are two results of this ek-stase, how could
we ever cease completely to see time from the point of view of the
present, and how could we completely escape from the inauthentic? It
is always in the present that we are centered, and our decision starts
from there; they can therefore always be brought into relationship with
our past, and are never motiveless, and, though they may open up a
cycle in our life which is entirely new, they still have to be subsequently
carried forward, and aﬀord only a temporary reprieve from dispersion.
There can therefore be no question of deriving time from spontaneity.
We are not temporal beings because we are spontaneous and because, as
consciousnesses, we tear ourselves away from ourselves. On the contrary, time is the foundation and measure of our spontaneity, and the
power of out-running and of ‘nihilating’ (‘néantiser’) which dwells
within us and is ourselves, is itself given to us with temporality and life.
Our birth, or, as Husserl has it in his unpublished writings, our ‘generativity’, is the basis both of our activity or individuality, and our
passivity or generality—that inner weakness which prevents us from
ever achieving the density of an absolute individual. We are not in
some incomprehensible way an activity joined to a passivity, an
automatism surmounted by a will, a perception surmounted by a
judgement, but wholly active and wholly passive, because we are the
upsurge of time.
We were once concerned22 with gaining an understanding of the
relationships between consciousness and nature, between the inner and
the outer. Or again, the problem was to link the idealist perspective,
according to which nothing exists except as an object for consciousness, and the realist perspective, according to which consciousnesses
are introduced into the stuﬀ of the objective world and of events in
themselves. Or ﬁnally, we were concerned with ﬁnding out how the
world and man are accessible to two kinds of investigation, in the ﬁrst
case explanatory and in the second reﬂective. We have already, in
another work, set out these traditional problems in another language
which strips away all inessentials: the whole question is ultimately one
of understanding what, in ourselves and in the world, is the relation
22

497

498 phenomenology of perception
between meaning and absence of meaning. Is the element of meaning which
is evident in the world produced and carried forward by the assemblage or convergence of independent facts or, on the other hand, is it
merely the expression of an absolute reason? We say that events have a
meaning when they appear as the achievement or the expression of a
single aim. There is signiﬁcance for us when one of our intentions is
fulﬁlled, or conversely when a number of facts or signs lend themselves
to our taking them up and grasping them inclusively, or, at all events,
when one or more terms exist as . . . representative or expressive of
something other than themselves. It is characteristic of idealism to
grant that all signiﬁcance is centrifugal, being an act of signiﬁcance or
Sinn-gebung,23 and that there are no natural signs. To understand is ultimately always to construct, to constitute, to bring about here and now
the synthesis of the object. Our analysis of one’s own body and of
perception has revealed to us a relation to the object, i.e. a signiﬁcance
deeper than this. The thing is nothing but a signiﬁcance, the signiﬁcance ‘thing’. Very well. But when I understand a thing, a picture for
example. I do not here and now eﬀect its synthesis, I come to it bringing my sensory ﬁelds and my perceptual ﬁeld with me, and in the last
resort I bring a schema of all possible being, a universal setting in
relation to the world. At the heart of the subject himself we discovered,
then, the presence of the world, so that the subject was no longer to be
understood as a synthetic activity, but as ek-stase, and that every active
process of signiﬁcation or Sinn-gebung appeared as derivative and secondary in relation to that pregnancy of meaning within signs which
could serve to deﬁne the world. We found beneath the intentionality of
acts, or thetic intentionality, another kind which is the condition of the
former’s possibility: namely an operative intentionality already at work
before any positing or any judgement, a ‘Logos of the aesthetic
world’,24 an ‘art hidden in the depths of the human soul’, one which,
like any art, is known only in its results. From this point onwards the
distinction made by us elsewhere between structure and signiﬁcation25
23

The expression is again often used by Husserl, for example Ideen, p. 107.

sense of ‘transcendental aesthetic’.

temporality

began to be clariﬁed: what constitutes the diﬀerence between the
Gestalt of the circle and the signiﬁcation ‘circle’, is that the latter is
recognized by an understanding which engenders it as the place of
points equidistant from a centre, the former by a subject familiar with
his world and able to seize it as a modulation of that world, as a circular
physiognomy. We have no way of knowing what a picture or a thing is
other than by looking at them, and their signiﬁcance is revealed only if we
look at them from a certain point of view, from a certain distance and
in a certain direction,* in short only if we place, at the service of the
spectacle, our collusion with the world. The phrase ‘direction of a
stream’ is meaningless unless I suppose a subject looking from one
place towards another. In the world in itself, all directions and all
movement are relative, which amounts to saying that there are none at
all. There would in fact be no movement, and I should have no notion
of it, if, in perception, I did not leave the earth, as my ‘ground’26 of all
rest and motion, on the hither side of rest and motion, because I inhabit
it, and similarly there would be no direction without a being who
inhabits the world and who, through the medium of his gaze, marks
out the ﬁrst direction as a basis for all others. In the same way, the face
or back of a piece of material is intelligible only for a subject who can
approach the object from one side or another, so that it is through my
upsurge into the world that the material has a face or back. Similarly
again, the meaning of a sentence is its import or intention, which once
more presupposes a departure and arrival point, an aim and a point of
view. And ﬁnally the sense of sight is a certain preparation for the logic,
and for the world, of colours. In all uses of the word sens, we ﬁnd the
same fundamental notion of a being orientated or polarized in the
direction of what he is not, and thus we are always brought back to a
conception of the subject as ek-stase, and to a relationship of active
transcendence between the subject and the world. The world is
inseparable from the subject, but from a subject which is nothing but a
project of the world, and the subject is inseparable from the world, but
* The argument is here, and in the following sentences, conducted by exploiting diﬀerent meanings of the French word sens (meaning, direction, sense, way, manner) which
are not covered by one single word in English (Translator’s note).

from a world which the subject itself projects. The subject is a beingin-the-world and the world remains ‘subjective’27 since its texture and
articulations are traced out by the subject’s movement of transcendence. Hence we discovered, with the world as cradle of meanings,
direction of all directions (sens de tous les sens), and ground of all thinking,
how to leave behind the dilemma of realism and idealism, contingency
and absolute reason, non-sense and sense. The world as we have tried
to show it, as standing on the horizon of our life as the primordial
unity of all our experiences, and one goal of all our projects, is no
longer the visible unfolding of a constituting Thought, not a chance
conglomeration of parts, nor, of course, the working of a controlling
Thought on an indiﬀerent matter, but the native abode of all
rationality.
Our analysis of time has conﬁrmed, initially, this new notion of
meaning and understanding. Considering it in the same light as any
other object, we shall be obliged to say of it what we have said of other
objects; that it has meaning for us only because ‘we are it’. We can
designate something by this word only because we are at the past,
present and future. It is literally the tenor* of our life, and, like the
world, is accessible only to the person who has his place within it, and
who follows its direction. But the analysis of time has not merely
provided an opportunity of reiterating what had been said about the
world. It throws light on the preceding analysis because it discloses
subject and object as two abstract ‘moments’ of a unique structure
which is presence. It is through time that being is conceived, because it is
through the relations of time-subject and time-object that we are able
to understand those obtaining between subject and world. Let us apply
to those problems we began with the idea of subjectivity as temporality. We wondered, for example, how to conceive the relations between
the soul and the body, rejecting as hopeless any attempt to tie up the
for-itself with a certain object in itself, to which it is supposed to stand in a
* sens (Translator’s note).

Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, p. 366: ‘Wenn das “Subjekt” ontologisch als existierendes
Dasein begriﬀen wird, deren Sein in der Zeitlichkeit gründet, dann muss gesagt werden:

relationship of causal dependence. But if the for-itself, the revelation of
self to self, is merely the hollow in which time is formed, and if the
world ‘in itself’ is simply the horizon of my present, then the problem is
reduced to the form: How is it that a being which is still to come and
has passed by, also has a present—which means that the problem is
eliminated, since the future, the past and the present are linked
together in the movement of temporalization. It is as much of my
essence to have a body as it is the future’s to be the future of a certain
present. So that neither scientiﬁc thematization nor objective thought
can discover a single bodily function strictly independent of existential
structures,28 or conversely a single ‘spiritual’ act which does not rest on
a bodily infrastructure. Moreover, it is essential to me not only to have a
body, but to have this body. It is not only the notion of the body which,
through that of the present, is necessarily linked to that of the for-itself;
the actual existence of my body is indispensable to that of my ‘consciousness’. In the last analysis, in so far as I know that the for-itself is the
culmination of a body, this can be only through the experience of my
one body and one for-itself, or through the experience of my presence in
the world. It will be objected that I might have nails, ears or lungs of
some other kind which would involve no change in my existence. But
then my nails, ears and lungs taken separately have no existence. It is
science which has accustomed us to regard the body as a collection of
parts, and also the experience of its disintegration at death. But the fact
is that a decomposed body is no longer a body. When I restore my ears,
nails and lungs to my living body, they no longer appear in the light of
contingent details. They are not indiﬀerent to the idea that others form
of me, contributing as they do to my physiognomy or my general
bearing, and it is not impossible that science may tomorrow express in
the form of objective correlations precisely how necessary it was that I
should have that kind of ears, nails and lungs, and whether, moreover, I
was destined to be dexterous or clumsy, placid or highly strung, intelligent or stupid, if I was destined to be me. In other words, as we have
shown elsewhere, the objective body is not the true version of the
phenomenal body, that is, the true version of the body that we live by:
it is indeed no more than the latter’s impoverished image, so that the
28

We demonstrated this at length in La Structure du Comportement.

501

502 phenomenology of perception
problem of the relation of soul to body has nothing to do with the
objective body, which exists only conceptually, but with the phenomenal body. What is true, however, is that our open and personal existence rests on an initial foundation of acquired and stabilized existence.
But it could not be otherwise, if we are temporality, since the dialectic
of acquisition and future is what constitutes time.
Our replies would be on the same lines to any questions that might
be raised concerning the world before man’s appearance on it. To our
assertion above that there is no world without an Existence that sustains
its structure, it might have been retorted that the world nevertheless
preceded man, that the earth, to all appearances, is the only inhabited
planet, and that philosophical views are thus shown to be incompatible
with the most ﬁrmly established facts. But in fact, it is only intellectualist, abstract reﬂection which is incompatible with misconceived ‘facts’.
For what precisely is meant by saying that the world existed before any
human consciousness? An example of what is meant is that the earth
originally issued from a primitive nebula from which the combination
of conditions necessary to life was absent. But every one of these
words, like every equation in physics, presupposes our pre-scientiﬁc
experience of the world, and this reference to the world in which we
live goes to make up the proposition’s valid meaning. Nothing will ever
bring home to my comprehension what a nebula that no one sees
could possibly be. Laplace’s nebula is not behind us, at our remote
beginnings, but in front of us in the cultural world. What, in fact, do
we mean when we say that there is no world without a being in the
world? Not indeed that the world is constituted by consciousness, but
on the contrary that consciousness always ﬁnds itself already at work in
the world. What is true, taking one thing with another, is that there is a
nature, which is not that of the sciences, but that which perception
presents to me, and that even the light of consciousness is, as
Heidegger says, lumen naturale, given to itself.
At all events, the critic may continue, the world will outlast me, and
other men will perceive it when I am no longer here. Now is it not
impossible for me to conceive, either after me, or even during my
lifetime, other men in the world, if indeed my presence in the world
is the condition of the world’s possibility? In the perspective of temporalization, light is thrown on the remarks made above about the

temporality

problem of the other. We said that in the perception of the other I cover
in intention the inﬁnite distance which always stands between my
subjectivity and another, I overcome the impossibility of conceiving
another for-himself for me, because I witness another behaviour,
another presence in the world. Now that we have more eﬀectively
analysed the notion of presence, linked together presence to oneself
and presence in the world, and identiﬁed the cogito with involvement in
the world, we are in a better position to understand how we can ﬁnd
others at the intentional origin of their visible behaviour. It is true that
the other will never exist for us as we exist ourselves; he is always a
lesser ﬁgure, and we never feel in him as we do in ourselves the thrust
of temporalization. But two temporalities are not mutually exclusive as
are two consciousnesses, because each one knows itself only by projecting itself into the present where they can interweave. As my living
present opens upon a past which I nevertheless am no longer living
through, and on a future which I do not yet live, and perhaps never
shall, it can also open on to temporalities outside my living experience
and acquire a social horizon, with the result that my world is expanded
to the dimensions of that collective history which my private existence
takes up and carries forward. The solution of all problems of transcendence is to be sought in the thickness of the pre-objective present,
in which we ﬁnd our bodily being, our social being, and the preexistence of the world, that is, the starting point of ‘explanations’, in so
far as they are legitimate—and at the same time the basis of our
freedom.

503

3
FREEDOM
Again, it is clear that no causal relationship is conceivable between the
subject and his body, his world or his society. Only at the cost of losing
the basis of all my certainties can I question what is conveyed to me by
my presence to myself. Now the moment I turn to myself in order to
describe myself, I have a glimpse of an anonymous ﬂux,1 a comprehensive project in which there are so far no ‘states of consciousness’, nor, a
fortiori, characteristics of any sort. For myself I am neither ‘jealous’, nor
‘inquisitive’, nor ‘hunchbacked’, nor ‘a civil servant’. It is often a matter of surprise that the cripple or the invalid can put up with himself.
The reason is that such people are not for themselves deformed or at
death’s door. Until the ﬁnal coma, the dying man is inhabited by a
consciousness, he is all that he sees, and enjoys this much of an outlet.
Consciousness can never objectify itself into invalid-consciousness or
cripple-consciousness, and even if the old man complains of his age or
the cripple of his deformity, they can do so only by comparing themselves with others, or seeing themselves through the eyes of others, that
is, by taking a statistical and objective view of themselves, so that such
complaints are never absolutely genuine: when he is back in the heart
of his own consciousness, each one of us feels beyond his limitations

In the sense in which, with Husserl, we have taken this word.

freedom

and thereupon resigns himself to them. They are the price which we
automatically pay for being in the world, a formality which we take for
granted. Hence we may speak disparagingly of our looks and still not
want to change our face for another. No idiosyncrasy can, seemingly,
be attached to the insuperable generality of consciousness, nor can any
limit be set to this immeasurable power of escape. In order to be
determined (in the two senses of that word) by an external factor, it is
necessary that I should be a thing. Neither my freedom nor my universality can admit of any eclipse. It is inconceivable that I should be free
in certain of my actions and determined in others: how should we
understand a dormant freedom that gave full scope to determinism?
And if it is assumed that it is snuﬀed out when it is not in action, how
could it be rekindled? If per impossible I had once succeeded in making
myself into a thing, how should I subsequently reconvert myself to consciousness? Once I am free, I am not to be counted among things, and I
must then be uninterruptedly free. Once my actions cease to be mine, I
shall never recover them, and if I lose my hold on the world, it will
never be restored to me. It is equally inconceivable that my liberty
should be attenuated; one cannot be to some extent free, and if, as is
often said, motives incline me in a certain direction, one of two things
happens: either they are strong enough to force me to act, in which
case there is no freedom, or else they are not strong enough, and then
freedom is complete, and as great in the worst torments as in the peace
of one’s home. We ought, therefore, to reject not only the idea of
causality, but also that of motivation.2 The alleged motive does not
burden my decision; on the contrary my decision lends the motive its
force. Everything that I ‘am’ in virtue of nature or history—
hunchbacked, handsome or Jewish—I never am completely for myself,
as we have just explained: and I may well be these things for other
people, nevertheless I remain free to posit another person as a consciousness whose views strike through to my very being, or on the
other hand merely as an object. It is also true that this option is itself a
form of constraint: if I am ugly, I have the choice between being an
object of disapproval or disapproving of others. I am left free to be a
masochist or a sadist, but not free to ignore others. But this dilemma,
2

505

506 phenomenology of perception
which is given as part of the human lot, is not one for me as pure
consciousness: it is still I who makes another to be for me and makes
each of us be as human beings. Moreover, even if existence as a human
being were imposed upon me, the manner alone being left to my
choice, and considering this choice itself and ignoring the small number of forms it might take, it would still be a free choice. If it is said that
my temperament inclines me particularly to either sadism or masochism, it is still merely a manner of speaking, for my temperament
exists only for the second order knowledge that I gain about myself
when I see myself as others see me, and in so far as I recognize it,
confer value upon it, and in that sense, choose it. What misleads us on
this, is that we often look for freedom in the voluntary deliberation
which examines one motive after another and seems to opt for the
weightiest or most convincing. In reality the deliberation follows the
decision, and it is my secret decision which brings the motives to light,
for it would be diﬃcult to conceive what the force of a motive might
be in the absence of a decision which it conﬁrms or to which it runs
counter. When I have abandoned a project, the motives which I
thought held me to it suddenly lose their force and collapse. In order to
resuscitate them, an eﬀort is required on my part to reopen time and
set me back to the moment preceding the making of the decision. Even
while I am deliberating, already I ﬁnd it an eﬀort to suspend time’s
ﬂow, and to keep open a situation which I feel is closed by a decision
which is already there and which I am holding oﬀ. That is why it so
often happens that after giving up a plan I experience a feeling of relief:
‘After all, I wasn’t all that involved’; the debate was purely a matter of
form, and the deliberation a mere parody, for I had decided against
from the start.
We often see the weakness of the will brought forward as an argument against freedom. And indeed, although I can will myself to adopt
a course of conduct and act the part of a warrior or a seducer, it is not
within my power to be a warrior or seducer with ease and in a way that
‘comes naturally’; really to be one, that is. But neither should we seek
freedom in the act of will, which is, in its very meaning, something
short of an act. We have recourse to an act of will only in order to go
against our true decision, and, as it were, for the purpose of proving
our powerlessness. If we had really and truly made the conduct of the

warrior or the seducer our own, then we should be one or the other.
Even what are called obstacles to freedom are in reality deployed by it.
An unclimbable rock face, a large or small, vertical or slanting rock, are
things which have no meaning for anyone who is not intending to
surmount them, for a subject whose projects do not carve out such
determinate forms from the uniform mass of the in itself and cause an
orientated world to arise—a signiﬁcance in things. There is, then,
ultimately nothing that can set limits to freedom, except those limits
that freedom itself has set in the form of its various initiatives, so that
the subject has simply the external world that he gives himself. Since it
is the latter who, on coming into being, brings to light signiﬁcance and
value in things, and since no thing can impinge upon it except through
acquiring, thanks to it, signiﬁcance and value, there is no action of
things on the subject, but merely a signiﬁcation (in the active sense), a
centrifugal Sinngebung. The choice would seem to lie between scientism’s conception of causality, which is incompatible with the consciousness which we have of ourselves, and the assertion of an absolute
freedom divorced from the outside. It is impossible to decide beyond
which point things cease to be ’ µιν. Either they all lie within our
power, or none does.
The result, however, of this ﬁrst reﬂection on freedom would appear
to be to rule it out altogether. If indeed it is the case that our freedom is
the same in all our actions, and even in our passions, if it is not to be
measured in terms of our conduct, and if the slave displays freedom as
much by living in fear as by breaking his chains, then it cannot be held
that there is such a thing as free action, freedom being anterior to all
actions. In any case it will not be possible to declare: ‘Here freedom
makes its appearance’, since free action, in order to be discernible, has
to stand out against a background of life from which it is entirely, or
almost entirely, absent. We may say in this case that it is everywhere,
but equally nowhere. In the name of freedom we reject the idea of
acquisition, since freedom has become a primordial acquisition and, as
it were, our state of nature. Since we do not have to provide it, it is the
gift granted to us of having no gift, it is the nature of consciousness
which consists in having no nature, and in no case can it ﬁnd external
expression or a place in our life. The idea of action, therefore, disappears: nothing can pass from us to the world, since we are nothing that

507

508 phenomenology of perception
can be speciﬁed, and since the non-being which constitutes us could
not possibly ﬁnd its way into the world’s plenum. There are merely
intentions immediately followed by their eﬀects, and we are very near
to the Kantian idea of an intention which is tantamount to the act,
which Scheler countered with the argument that the cripple who
would like to be able to save a drowning man and the good swimmer
who actually saves him do not have the same experience of autonomy.
The very idea of choice vanishes, for to choose is to choose something in
which freedom sees, at least for a moment, a symbol of itself. There is
free choice only if freedom comes into play in its decision, and posits
the situation chosen as a situation of freedom. A freedom which has no
need to be exercised because it is already acquired could not commit
itself in this way: it knows that the following instant will ﬁnd it, come
what may, just as free and just as indeterminate. The very notion of
freedom demands that our decision should plunge into the future, that
something should have been done by it, that the subsequent instant
should beneﬁt from its predecessor and, though not necessitated,
should be at least required by it. If freedom is doing, it is necessary that
what it does should not be immediately undone by a new freedom.
Each instant, therefore, must not be a closed world; one instant must be
able to commit its successors and, a decision once taken and action
once begun, I must have something acquired at my disposal, I must
beneﬁt from my impetus, I must be inclined to carry on, and there
must be a bent or propensity of the mind. It was Descartes who held
that conservation demands a power as great as does creation; a view
which implies a realistic notion of the instant. It is true that the instant
is not a philosopher’s ﬁction. It is the point at which one project is
brought to fruition and another begun3—the point at which my gaze is
transferred from one end to another, it is the Augen-Blick. But this break
in time cannot occur unless each of the two spans is of a piece. Consciousness, it is said, is, though not atomized into instants, at least
haunted by the spectre of the instant which it is obliged continually to
exorcise by a free act. We shall soon see that we have indeed always the
power to interrupt, but it implies in any case a power to begin, for there
would be no severance unless freedom had taken up its abode some3

where and were preparing to move it. Unless there are cycles of
behaviour, open situations requiring a certain completion and capable
of constituting a background to either a conﬁrmatory or transformatory decision, we never experience freedom. Choice of an intelligible
sort is excluded, not only because there is no time anterior to time, but
because choice presupposes a prior commitment and because the idea
of an initial choice involves a contradiction. If freedom is to have room*
in which to move, if it is to be describable as freedom, there must be
something to hold it away from its objectives, it must have a ﬁeld, which
means that there must be for it special possibilities, or realities which
tend to cling to being. As J. P. Sartre himself observes, dreaming is
incompatible with freedom because, in the realm of imagination, we
have no sooner taken a certain signiﬁcance as our goal than we already
believe that we have intuitively brought it into being, in short, because
there is no obstacle and nothing to do.4 It is established that freedom is
not to be confused with those abstract decisions of will at grips with
motives or passions, for the classical conception of deliberation is relevant only to a freedom ‘in bad faith’ which secretly harbours antagonistic motives without being prepared to act on them, and so itself
manufactures the alleged proofs of its impotence. We can see, beneath
these noisy debates and these fruitless eﬀorts to ‘construct’ ourselves,
the tacit decisions whereby we have marked out round ourselves the
ﬁeld of possibility, and it is true that nothing is done as long as we
cling to these ﬁxed points, and everything is easy as soon as we have
weighed anchor. This is why our freedom is not to be sought in spurious discussion on the conﬂict between a style of life which we have no
wish to reappraise and circumstances suggestive of another: the real
choice is that of whole character and our manner of being in the world.
But either this total choice is never uttered, since it is the silent upsurge
of our being in the world, in which case it is not clear in what sense it
could be said to be ours, since this freedom glides over itself and is the
equivalent of a fate—or else our choice of ourselves is truly a choice, a
conversion involving our whole existence. In this case, however, there

is presupposed a previous acquisition which the choice sets out to
modify and it founds a new tradition: this leads us to ask whether the
perpetual severance in terms of which we initially deﬁned freedom is
not simply the negative aspect of our universal commitment to a
world, and whether our indiﬀerence to each determinate thing does
not express merely our involvement in all; whether the ready-made
freedom from which we started is not reducible to a power of initiative, which cannot be transformed into doing without taking up some
proposition of the world, and whether, in short, concrete and actual
freedom is not indeed to be found in this exchange. It is true that
nothing has signiﬁcance and value for anyone but me and through anyone
but me, but this proposition remains indeterminate and is still indistinguishable from the Kantian idea of a consciousness which ‘ﬁnds in
things only what it has put into them’, and from the idealist refutation
of realism, as long as we fail to make clear how we understand signiﬁcance and the self. By deﬁning ourselves as a universal power of SinnGebung, we have reverted to the method of the ‘thing without which’
and to the analytical reﬂection of the traditional type, which seeks the
conditions of possibility without concerning itself with the conditions
of reality. We must therefore resume the analysis of the Sinngebung, and
show how it can be both centrifugal and centripetal, since it has been
established that there is no freedom without a ﬁeld.
When I say that this rock is unclimbable, it is certain that this attribute, like that of being big or little, straight and oblique, and indeed like
all attributes in general, can be conferred upon it only by the project of
climbing it, and by a human presence. It is, therefore, freedom which
brings into being the obstacles to freedom, so that the latter can be set
over against it as its bounds. However, it is clear that, one and the same
project being given, one rock will appear as an obstacle, and another,
being more negotiable, as a means. My freedom, then, does not so
contrive it that this way there is an obstacle, and that way a way
through, it arranges for there to be obstacles and ways through
in general; it does not draw the particular outline of this world, but
merely lays down its general structures. It may be objected that there is
no diﬀerence; if my freedom conditions the structure of the ‘there is’,
that of the ‘here’ and the ‘there’, it is present wherever these structures
arise. We cannot distinguish the quality of ‘obstacle’ from the obstacle

freedom

itself, and relate one to freedom and the other to the world in itself
which, without freedom, would be merely an amorphous and
unnameable mass. It is not, therefore, outside myself that I am able to
ﬁnd a limit to my freedom. But do I not ﬁnd it in myself? We must
indeed distinguish between my express intentions, for example the
plan I now make to climb those mountains, and general intentions
which evaluate the potentialities of my environment. Whether or not I
have decided to climb them, these mountains appear high to me,
because they exceed my body’s power to take them in its stride, and,
even if I have just read Micromégas, I cannot so contrive it that they are
small for me. Underlying myself as a thinking subject, who am able to
take my place at will on Sirius or on the earth’s surface, there is,
therefore, as it were a natural self which does not budge from its
terrestrial situation and which constantly adumbrates absolute valuations. What is more, my projects as a thinking being are clearly modelled on the latter; if I elect to see things from the point of view of
Sirius, it is still to my terrestrial experience that I must have recourse in
order to do so; I may say, for example, that the Alps are molehills. In so
far as I have hands, feet, a body, I sustain around me intentions which
are not dependent upon my decisions and which aﬀect my surroundings in a way which I do not choose. These intentions are general in a
double sense: ﬁrstly in the sense that they constitute a system in which
all possible objects are simultaneously included; if the mountain
appears high and upright, the tree appears small and sloping; and
furthermore in the sense that they are not simply mine, they originate
from other than myself, and I am not surprised to ﬁnd them in all
psycho-physical subjects organized as I am. Hence, as Gestalt psychology has shown, there are for me certain shapes which are particularly
favoured, as they are for other men, and which are capable of giving
rise to a psychological science and rigorous laws. The grouping of dots

is always perceived as six pairs of dots with two millimetres between
each pair, while one ﬁgure is always perceived as a cube, and another as
a plane mosaic.5 It is as if, on the hither side of our judgement and our

511

512 phenomenology of perception
freedom, someone were assigning such and such a signiﬁcance to such
and such a given grouping. It is indeed true that perceptual structures
do not always force themselves upon the observer; there are some
which are ambiguous. But these reveal even more eﬀectively the presence within us of spontaneous evaluation: for they are elusive shapes
which suggest constantly changing meanings to us. Now a pure consciousness is capable of anything except being ignorant of its intentions, and an absolute freedom cannot choose itself as hesitant, since
that amounts to allowing itself to be drawn in several directions, and
since, the possibilities being ex hypothesi indebted to freedom for all the
strength they have, the weight that freedom gives to one is thereby
withdrawn from the rest. We can break up a shape by looking at it awry,
but this too is because freedom uses the gaze along with its spontaneous evaluations. Without the latter, we would not have a world, that
is, a collection of things which emerge from a background of formlessness by presenting themselves to our body as ‘to be touched’, ‘to be
taken’, ‘to be climbed over’. We should never be aware of adjusting
ourselves to things and reaching them where they are, beyond us, but
would be conscious only of restricting our thoughts to the immanent
objects of our intentions, and we should not be in the world, ourselves
implicated in the spectacle and, so to speak, intermingled with things,
we should simply enjoy the spectacle of a universe. It is, therefore, true
that there are no obstacles in themselves, but the self which qualiﬁes
them as such is not some acosmic subject; it runs ahead of itself in
relation to things in order to confer upon them the form of things.
There is an autochthonous signiﬁcance of the world which is constituted in the dealings which our incarnate existence has with it, and
which provides the ground of every deliberate Sinngebung.
This is true not only of an impersonal and, all in all, abstract function
such as ‘external perception’. There is something comparable present
in all evaluations. It has been perceptively remarked that pain and
fatigue can never be regarded as causes which ‘act’ upon my liberty,
and that, in so far as I may experience either at any given moment, they
do not have their origin outside me, but always have a signiﬁcance and
express my attitude towards the world. Pain makes me give way and say
what I ought to have kept to myself, fatigue makes me break my journey. We all know the moment at which we decide no longer to endure

freedom

pain or fatigue, and when, simultaneously, they become intolerable in
fact. Tiredness does not halt my companion, because he likes the
clamminess of his body, the heat of the road and the sun, in short,
because he likes to feel himself in the midst of things, to feel their rays
converging upon him, to be the cynosure of all this light, and an object
of touch for the earth’s crust. My own fatigue brings me to a halt
because I dislike it, because I have chosen diﬀerently my manner of
being in the world, because, for instance, I endeavour, not to be in
nature, but rather to win the recognition of others. I am free in relation
to fatigue to precisely the extent that I am free in relation to my being
in the world, free to make my way by transforming it.6 But here once
more we must recognize a sort of sedimentation of our life: an attitude
towards the world, when it has received frequent conﬁrmation,
acquires a favoured status for us. Yet since freedom does not tolerate
any motive in its path, my habitual being in the world is at each
moment equally precarious, and the complexes which I have allowed
to develop over the years always remain equally soothing, and the free
act can with no diﬃculty blow them sky-high. However, having built
our life upon an inferiority complex which has been operative for
twenty years, it is not probable that we shall change. It is clear what a
summary rationalism might say in reply to such a hybrid notion: there
are no degrees of possibility; either the free act is no longer possible, or
it is still possible, in which case freedom is complete. In short, ‘probable’ is meaningless. It is a notion belonging to statistical thought,
which is not thought at all, since it does not concern any particular
thing actually existing, any moment of time, any concrete event. ‘It is
improbable that Paul will give up writing bad books’ means nothing,
since Paul may well decide to write no more such books. The probable
is everywhere and nowhere, a reiﬁed ﬁction, with only a psychological
existence; it is not an ingredient of the world. And yet we have already
met it a little while ago in the perceived world. The mountain is great or
small to the extent that, as a perceived thing, it is to be found in the
ﬁeld of my possible actions, and in relation to a level which is not only
that of my individual life, but that of ‘any man’. Generality and
probability are not ﬁctions, but phenomena; we must therefore ﬁnd a
6

513

514 phenomenology of perception
phenomenological basis for statistical thought. It belongs necessarily to
a being which is ﬁxed, situated and surrounded by things in the world.
‘It is improbable’ that I should at this moment destroy an inferiority
complex in which I have been content to live for twenty years. That
means that I have committed myself to inferiority, that I have made it
my abode, that this past, though not a fate, has at least a speciﬁc weight
and is not a set of events over there, at a distance from me, but the
atmosphere of my present. The rationalist’s dilemma: either the free act
is possible, or it is not—either the event originates in me or is imposed
on me from outside, does not apply to our relations with the world and
with our past. Our freedom does not destroy our situation, but gears
itself to it: as long as we are alive, our situation is open, which implies
both that it calls up specially favoured modes of resolution, and also
that it is powerless to bring one into being by itself.
We shall arrive at the same result by considering our relations with
history. Taking myself in my absolute concreteness, as I am presented
to myself in reﬂection, I ﬁnd that I am an anonymous and pre-human
ﬂux, as yet unqualiﬁed as, for instance, ‘a working man’ or ‘middle
class’. If I subsequently think of myself as a man among men, a bourgeois among bourgeois, this can be, it would seem, no more than a
second order view of myself; I am never in my heart of hearts a worker
or a bourgeois, but a consciousness which freely evaluates itself as a
middle class or proletarian consciousness. And indeed, it is never the
case that my objective position in the production process is suﬃcient to
awaken class consciousness. There was exploitation long before there
were revolutionaries. Nor is it always in periods of economic diﬃculty
that the working class movement makes headway. Revolt is, then, not
the outcome of objective conditions, but it is rather the decision taken
by the worker to will revolution that makes a proletarian of him. The
evaluation of the present operates through one’s free project for the
future. From which we might conclude that history by itself has no
signiﬁcance, but only that conferred upon it by our will. Yet here again
we are slipping into the method of ‘the indispensable condition failing
which . . .’: in opposition to objective thought, which includes the
subject in its deterministic system, we set idealist reﬂection which
makes determinism dependent upon the constituting activity of the
subject. Now, we have already seen that objective thought and

freedom

analytical reﬂection are two aspects of the same mistake, two ways of
overlooking the phenomena. Objective thought derives class consciousness from the objective condition of the proletariat. Idealist
reﬂection reduces the proletarian condition to the awareness of it,
which the proletarian arrives at. The former traces class-consciousness
to the class deﬁned in terms of objective characteristics, the latter on
the other hand reduces ‘being a workman’ to the consciousness of
being one. In each case we are in the realm of abstraction, because we
remain torn between the in itself and the for itself. If we approach the
question afresh with the idea of discovering, not the causes of the act of
becoming aware, for there is no cause which can act from outside upon
a consciousness—nor the conditions of its possibility, for we need
to know the conditions which actually produce it—but classconsciousness itself, if, in short, we apply a genuinely existential
method, what do we ﬁnd? I am not conscious of being working class or
middle class simply because, as a matter of fact, I sell my labour or,
equally as a matter of fact, because my interests are bound up with
capitalism, nor do I become one or the other on the day on which I
elect to view history in the light of the class struggle: what happens is
that ‘I exist as working class’ or ‘I exist as middle class’ in the ﬁrst place,
and it is this mode of dealing with the world and society which provides both the motives for my revolutionary or conservative projects
and my explicit judgements of the type: ‘I am working class’ or ‘I am
middle class’, without its being possible to deduce the former from the
latter, or vice versa. What makes me a proletarian is not the economic
system or society considered as systems of impersonal forces, but these
institutions as I carry them within me and experience them; nor is it an
intellectual operation devoid of motive, but my way of being in the
world within this institutional framework.
Let us suppose that I have a certain style of living, being at the mercy
of booms and slumps, not being free to do as I like, receiving a weekly
wage, having no control over either the conditions or the products of
my work, and consequently feeling a stranger in my factory, my nation
and my life. I have acquired the habit of reckoning with a fatum, or
appointed order, which I do not respect, but which I have to humour.
Or suppose that I work as a day-labourer, having no farm of my own,
no tools, going from one farm to another hiring myself out at harvest

515

516 phenomenology of perception
time; in that case I have the feeling that there is some anonymous
power hovering over me and making a nomad of me, even though I
want to settle into a regular job. Or ﬁnally suppose I am the tenant of a
farm to which the owner has had no electricity laid on, though the
mains are less than two hundred yards away. I have, for my family and
myself, only one habitable room, although it would be easy to make
other rooms available in the house. My fellow workers in factory or
ﬁeld, or other farmers, do the same work as I do in comparable conditions; we co-exist in the same situation and feel alike, not in virtue of
some comparison, as if each one of us lived primarily within himself,
but on the basis of our tasks and gestures. These situations do not imply
any express evaluation, and if there is a tacit evaluation, it represents the
thrust of a freedom devoid of any project against unknown obstacles;
one cannot in any case talk about a choice, for in all three cases it is
enough that I should be born into the world and that I exist in order to
experience my life as full of diﬃculties and constraints—I do not
choose so to experience it. But this state of aﬀairs can persist without
my becoming class-conscious, understanding that I am of the proletariat and becoming a revolutionary. How then am I to make this
change? The worker learns that other workers in a diﬀerent trade have,
after striking, obtained a wage-increase, and notices that subsequently
wages have gone up in his own factory. The appointed order with
which he was at grips is beginning to take on a clearer shape. The daylabourer who has not often seen workers in regular employment, who
is not like them and has little love for them, sees the price of manufactured goods and the cost of living going up, and becomes aware that
he can no longer earn a livelihood. He may at this point blame town
workers, in which case class-consciousness will not make its appearance. If it does, it is not because the day-labourer has decided to
become a revolutionary and consequently confers a value upon his
actual condition; it is because he has perceived, in a concrete way, that
his life is synchronized with the life of the town labourers and that all
share a common lot. The small farmer who does not associate himself
with the day-labourers, still less with the town labourers, being separated from them by a whole world of customs and value judgements,
nevertheless feels that he is on the same side as the journeyman when
he pays them an inadequate wage, and he even feels that he has

freedom

something in common with the town workers when he learns that the
farm owner is chairman of the board of directors of several industrial
concerns. Social space begins to acquire a magnetic ﬁeld, and a region
of the exploited is seen to appear. At every pressure felt from any
quarter of the social horizon, the process of regrouping becomes
clearly discernible beyond ideologies and various occupations. Class is
coming into being, and we say that a situation is revolutionary when
the connection objectively existing between the sections of the proletariat (the connection, that is, which an absolute observer would recognize as so existing) is ﬁnally experienced in perception as a common
obstacle to the existence of each and every one. It is not at all necessary
that at any single moment a representation of revolution should arise. For
example, it is doubtful whether the Russian peasants of 1917 expressly
envisaged revolution and the transfer of property. Revolution arises day
by day from the concatenation of less remote and more remote ends. It
is not necessary that each member of the proletariat should think of
himself as such, in the sense that a Marxist theoretician gives to the
word. It is suﬃcient that the journeyman or the farmer should feel that
he is on the march towards a certain crossroads, to which the road
trodden by the town labourers also leads. Both ﬁnd their journey’s end
in revolution, which would perhaps have terriﬁed them had it been
described and represented to them in advance. One might say at the
most that revolution is at the end of the road they have taken and in
their projects in the form of ‘things must change’, which each one
experiences concretely in his distinctive diﬃculties and in the depths
of his particular prejudices. Neither the appointed order, nor the free
act which destroys it, is represented; they are lived through in ambiguity.
This does not mean that workers and peasants bring about revolution
without being aware of it, and that we have here blind, ‘elementary
forces’ cleverly exploited by a few shrewd agitators. It is possibly in this
light that the prefect of police will view history. But such ways of
seeing things do not help him when faced with a genuine revolutionary situation, in which the slogans of the alleged agitators are immediately understood, as if by some pre-established harmony, and meet
with concurrence on all sides, because they crystallize what is latent in
the life of all productive workers. The revolutionary movement, like the
work of the artist, is an intention which itself creates its instruments

517

518 phenomenology of perception
and its means of expression. The revolutionary project is not the result
of a deliberate judgement, or the explicit positing of an end. It is these
things in the case of the propagandist, because the propagandist has
been trained by the intellectual, or, in the case of the intellectual,
because he regulates his life on the basis of his thoughts. But it does not
cease to be the abstract decision of a thinker and become a historical
reality until it is worked out in the dealings men have with each other,
and in the relations of the man to his job. It is, therefore, true that I
recognize myself as a worker or a bourgeois on the day I take my stand
in relation to a possible revolution, and that this taking of a stand is not
the outcome, through some mechanical causality, of my status as
workman or bourgeois (which is why all classes have their traitors),
but neither is it an unwarranted evaluation, instantaneous and
unmotivated; it is prepared by some molecular process, it matures in
co-existence before bursting forth into words and being related to
objective ends. One is justiﬁed in drawing attention to the fact that it is
not the greatest poverty which produces the most clear-sighted revolutionaries, but one forgets to ask why a return of prosperity frequently
brings with it a more radical mood among the masses. It is because the
easing of living conditions makes a fresh structure of social space possible: the horizon is not restricted to the most immediate concerns,
there is economic play and room for a new project in relation to living.
This phenomenon does not, then, go to prove that the worker makes
himself into worker and revolutionary ex nihilo, but on the contrary that
he does so on a certain basis of co-existence. The mistake inherent in
the conception under discussion is, in general, that of disregarding all
but intellectual projects, instead of considering the existential project,
which is the polarization of a life towards a goal which is both
determinate and indeterminate, which, to the person concerned, is
entirely unrepresented, and which is recognized only on being
attained. Intentionality is brought down to the particular cases of the
objectifying acts, the proletarian condition is made an object of
thought, and no diﬃculty is experienced in showing, in accordance
with idealism’s permanent method, that, like every other object of
thought, it subsists only before and through the consciousness
which constitutes it as an object. Idealism (like objective thought)
bypasses true intentionality, which is at its object rather than positing

freedom

it. Idealism overlooks the interrogative, the subjunctive, the aspiration,
the expectation, the positive indeterminacy of these modes of consciousness, for it is acquainted only with consciousness in the present
or future indicative, which is why it fails to account for class. For class
is a matter neither for observation nor decree; like the appointed order
of the capitalistic system, like revolution, before being thought it is
lived through as an obsessive presence, as possibility, enigma and
myth. To make class-consciousness the outcome of a decision and a
choice is to say that problems are solved on the day they are posed, that
every question already contains the reply that it awaits; it is, in short, to
revert to immanence and abandon the attempt to understand history.
In reality, the intellectual project and the positing of ends are merely
the bringing to completion of an existential project. It is I who give a
direction, signiﬁcance and future to my life, but that does not mean
that these are concepts; they spring from my present and past and in
particular from my mode of present and past coexistence. Even in the
case of the intellectual who turns revolutionary, his decision does not
arise ex nihilo; it may follow upon a prolonged period of solitude: the
intellectual is in search of a doctrine which shall make great demands
on him and cure him of his subjectivity; or he may yield to the clear
light thrown by a Marxist interpretation of history, in which case he
has given knowledge pride of place in his life, and that in itself is
understandable only in virtue of his past and his childhood. Even the
decision to become a revolutionary without motive, and by an act of
pure freedom would express a certain way of being in the natural and
social world, which is typically that of the intellectual. He ‘throws in
his lot with the working class’ from the starting point of his situation as
an intellectual and from nowhere else (and this is why even ﬁdeism, in
his case, remains rightly suspect). Now with the worker it is a fortiori the
case that his decision is elaborated in the course of his life. This time it
is through no misunderstanding that the horizon of a particular life
and revolutionary aims coincide: for the worker revolution is a more
immediate possibility, and one closer to his own interests than for the
intellectual, since he is at grips with the economic system in his very
life. For this reason there are, statistically, more workers than middle
class people in a revolutionary party. Motivation, of course, does not do
away with freedom. Working class parties of the most unmistakable

519

520 phenomenology of perception
kind have had many intellectuals among their leaders, and it is likely
that a man such as Lenin identiﬁed himself with revolution and eventually transcended the distinction between intellectual and worker. But
these are the virtues proper to action and commitment; at the outset, I
am not an individual beyond class, I am situated in a social environment, and my freedom, though it may have the power to commit me
elsewhere, has not the power to transform me instantaneously into
what I decide to be. Thus to be a bourgeois or a worker is not only to
be aware of being one or the other, it is to identify oneself as worker or
bourgeois through an implicit or existential project which merges into
our way of patterning the world and co-existing with other people. My
decision draws together a spontaneous meaning of my life which it
may conﬁrm or repudiate, but not annul. Both idealism and objective
thinking fail to pin down the coming into being of class consciousness,
the former because it deduces actual existence from consciousness, the
latter because it derives consciousness from de facto existence, and both
because they overlook the relationship of motivation.
It will perhaps be objected, from the idealist side, that I am not, for
myself, a particular project, but a pure consciousness, and that the
attributes of bourgeois or worker belong to me only to the extent that I
place myself among others, and see myself through their eyes, from the
outside, as ‘another’. Here we should have categories of For Others and
not For Oneself. But if there were two sorts of categories, how could I
have the experience of another, that is, of an alter ego? This experience
presupposes that already my view of myself is halfway to having the
quality of a possible ‘other’, and that in my view of another is implied
his quality as ego. It will be replied that the other is given to me as a fact,
and not as a possibility of my own being. What is meant by this? Is it
that I should not have the experience of other men if there were none
on the earth’s surface? The proposition is self-evidently true, but does
not solve our problem since, as Kant has already said, we cannot pass
from ‘All knowledge begins with experience’ to ‘All knowledge
derives from experience’. If the other people who empirically exist are
to be, for me, other people, I must have a means of recognizing them,
and the structures of the For Another must, therefore, already be the
dimensions of the For Oneself. Moreover, it is impossible to derive
from the For Another all the speciﬁcations of which we are speaking.

freedom

Another person is not necessarily, is not even ever quite an object for
me. And, in sympathy for example, I can perceive another as bare
existence and freedom as much or as little as myself. The-other-asobject is nothing but an insincere modality of others, just as absolute
subjectivity is nothing but an abstract notion of myself. I must, therefore, in the most radical reﬂection, apprehend around my absolute
individuality a kind of halo of generality or a kind of atmosphere of
‘sociality’. This is necessary if subsequently the words ‘a bourgeois’
and ‘a man’ are to be able to assume meaning for me. I must apprehend
myself from the onset as centred in a way outside myself, and my
individual existence must diﬀuse round itself, so to speak, an existence
in quality. The For-Themselves—me for myself and the other for
himself—must stand out against a background of For Others—I for the
other and the other for me. My life must have a signiﬁcance which I do
not constitute; there must strictly speaking be an intersubjectivity; each
one of us must be both anonymous in the sense of absolutely individual, and anonymous in the sense of absolutely general. Our being in
the world, is the concrete bearer of this double anonymity.
Provided that this is so, there can be situations, a direction* of history, and a historical truth: three ways of saying the same thing. If
indeed I made myself into a worker or a bourgeois by an absolute
initiative, and if in general terms nothing ever courted our freedom,
history would display no structure, no event would be seen to take
shape in it, and anything might emerge from anything else. There
would be no British Empire as a relatively stable historical form to
which a name can be given, and in which certain probable properties
are recognizable. There would not be, in the history of social progress,
revolutionary situations or periods of set-back. A social revolution
would be equally possible at any moment, and one might reasonably
expect a despot to undergo conversion to anarchism. History would
never move in any direction, nor would it be possible to say that even
over a short period of time events were conspiring to produce any
deﬁnite outcome. The statesman would always be an adventurer, that is
to say, he would turn events to his own advantage by conferring upon
them a meaning which they did not have. Now if it is true that history is
* ‘sens’ (Translator’s note).

521

522 phenomenology of perception
powerless to complete anything independently of consciousnesses
which assume it and thereby decide its course, and if consequently it
can never be detached from us to play the part of an alien force using us
for its own ends, then precisely because it is always history lived through we
cannot withhold from it at least a fragmentary meaning. Something is
being prepared which will perhaps come to nothing but which may,
for the moment, conform to the adumbrations of the present. Nothing
can so order it that, in the France of 1799, a military power ‘above
classes’ should not appear as a natural product of the ebb of revolution,
and that the rôle of military dictator should not here be ‘a part that has
to be played’. It is Bonaparte’s project, known to us through its realization, which causes us to pass such a judgement. But before Bonaparte,
Dumouriez, Custine and others had envisaged it, and this common
tendency has to be accounted for. What is known as the signiﬁcance of
events is not an idea which produces them, or the fortuitous result of
their occurring together. It is the concrete project of a future which is
elaborated within social coexistence and in the One* before any personal decision is made. At the point of revolutionary history to which
class dynamics had carried it by 1799, when neither the Revolution
could be carried forward nor the clock put back, the situation was such
that, all due reservations as to individual freedom having been made,
each individual, through the functional and generalized existence
which makes a historical subject of him, tended to fall back upon what
had been acquired. It would have been a historical mistake at that stage
to suggest to them either a resumption of the methods of revolutionary
government or a reversion to the social conditions of 1789, not
because there is a truth of history independent of our projects and
evaluations, which are always free, but because there is an average and
statistical signiﬁcance of these projects. Which means that we confer
upon history its signiﬁcance, but not without its putting that signiﬁcance forward itself. The Sinngebung is not merely centrifugal, which is
why the subject of history is not the individual. There is an exchange
between generalized and individual existence, each receiving and
giving something. There is a moment at which the signiﬁcance which
was foreshadowed in the One, and which was merely a precarious
* In the sense of das Man, the impersonal pronoun (Translator’s note).

freedom

possibility threatened by the contingency of history, is taken up by an
individual. It may well happen that now, having taken command of
history, he leads it, for a time at least, far beyond what seemed to
comprise its signiﬁcance, and involves it in a fresh dialectic, as when
Bonaparte, from being Consul, made himself Emperor and conqueror.
We are not asserting that history from end to end has only one meaning, any more than has an individual life. We mean simply that in any
case freedom modiﬁes it only by taking up the meaning which history
was oﬀering at the moment in question, and by a kind of unobtrusive
assimilation. On the strength of this proposal made by the present, the
adventurer can be distinguished from the statesman, historical imposture from the truth of an epoch, with the result that our assessment of
the past, though never arriving at absolute objectivity, is at the same
time never entitled to be arbitrary.
We therefore recognize, around our initiatives and around that
strictly individual project which is onself, a zone of generalized existence and of projects already formed, signiﬁcances which trail between
ourselves and things and which confer upon us the quality of man,
bourgeois or worker. Already generality intervenes, already our presence to ourselves is mediated by it and we cease to be pure consciousness, as soon as the natural or social constellation ceases to be an
unformulated this and crystallizes into a situation, as soon as it has a
meaning—in short, as soon as we exist. Every thing appears to us
through a medium to which it lends its own fundamental quality; this
piece of wood is neither a collection of colours and tactile data, not
even their total Gestalt, but something from which there emanates a
woody essence; these ‘sensory givens’ modulate a certain theme or
illustrate a certain style which is the wood itself, and which creates,
round this piece of wood and the perception I have of it, a horizon of
signiﬁcance. The natural world, as we have seen, is nothing other than
the place of all possible themes and styles. It is indissolubly an
unmatched individual and a signiﬁcance. Correspondingly, the generality and the individuality of the subject, subjectivity qualiﬁed and
pure, the anonymity of the One and the anonymity of consciousness
are not two conceptions of the subject between which philosophy has
to choose, but two stages of a unique structure which is the concrete
subject. Let us consider, for example, sense experience. I lose myself in

523

524 phenomenology of perception
this red which is before me, without in any way qualifying it, and it
seems that this experience brings me into contact with a pre-human
subject. Who perceives this red? It is nobody who can be named and
placed among other perceiving subjects. For, between this experience
of red which I have, and that about which other people speak to me, no
direct comparison will ever be possible. I am here in my own point of
view, and since all experience, in so far as it derives from impression, is
in the same way strictly my own, it seems that a unique and unduplicated subject enfolds them all. Suppose I formulate a thought, the God
of Spinoza, for example; this thought as it is in my living experience is
a certain landscape to which no one will ever have access, even if,
moreover, I manage to enter into a discussion with a friend on the
subject of Spinoza’s God. However, the very individuality of these
experiences is not quite unadulterated. For the thickness of this red, its
thisness, the power it has of reaching me and saturating me, are attributable to the fact that it requires and obtains from my gaze a certain
vibration, and imply that I am familiar with a world of colours of
which this one is a particular variation. The concrete colour red, therefore, stands out against a background of generality, and this is why,
even without transferring myself to another’s point of view, I grasp
myself in perception as a perceiving subject, and not as unclassiﬁable
consciousness. I feel, all round my perception of red, all the regions of
my being unaﬀected by it, and that region set aside for colours,
‘vision’, through which the perception ﬁnds its way into me. Similarly
my thought about the God of Spinoza is only apparently a strictly
unique experience, for it is the concretion of a certain cultural world,
the Spinozist philosophy, or of a certain philosophic style in which I
immediately recognize a ‘Spinozist’ idea. There is therefore no occasion to ask ourselves why the thinking subject or consciousness perceives itself as a man, or an incarnate or historical subject, nor must we
treat this apperception as a second order operation which it somehow
performs starting from its absolute existence: the absolute ﬂow takes
shape beneath its own gaze as ‘a consciousness’, or a man, or an incarnate subject, because it is a ﬁeld of presence—to itself, to others and to
the world—and because this presence throws it into the natural and
cultural world from which it arrives at an understanding of itself. We
must not envisage this ﬂux as absolute contact with oneself, as an

freedom

absolute density with no internal fault, but on the contrary as a being
which is in pursuit of itself outside. If the subject made a constant and
at all times peculiar choice of himself, one might wonder why his
experience always ties up with itself and presents him with objects and
deﬁnite historical phases, why we have a general notion of time valid
through all times, and why ﬁnally the experience of each one of us
links up with that of others. But it is the question itself which must be
questioned: for what is given, is not one fragment of time followed by
another, one individual ﬂux, then another; it is the taking up of each
subjectivity by itself, and of subjectivities by each other in the generality of a single nature, the cohesion of an intersubjective life and a
world. The present mediates between the For Oneself and the For
Others, between individuality and generality. True reﬂection presents
me to myself not as idle and inaccessible subjectivity, but as identical
with my presence in the world and to others, as I am now realizing it: I
am all that I see, I am an intersubjective ﬁeld, not despite my body and
historical situation, but, on the contrary, by being this body and this
situation, and through them, all the rest.
What, then, becomes of the freedom we spoke about at the outset, if
this point of view is taken? I can no longer pretend to be a nihilation
(néant), and to choose myself continually out of nothing at all. If it is
through subjectivity that nothingness appears in the world, it can
equally be said that it is through the world that nothingness comes into
being. I am a general refusal to be anything, accompanied surreptitiously by a continual acceptance of such and such a qualiﬁed form of
being. For even this general refusal is still one manner of being, and has its place in the
world. It is true that I can at any moment interrupt my projects. But what
is this power? It is the power to begin something else, for we never
remain suspended in nothingness. We are always in a plenum, in being,
just as a face, even in repose, even in death, is always doomed to express
something (there are people whose faces, in death, bear expressions of
surprise, or peace, or discretion), and just as silence is still a modality
of the world of sound. I may defy all accepted form, and spurn everything, for there is no case in which I am utterly committed: but in this
case I do not withdraw into my freedom, I commit myself elsewhere.
Instead of thinking about my bereavement, I look at my nails, or
have lunch, or engage in politics. Far from its being the case that my

525

526 phenomenology of perception
freedom is always unattended, it is never without an accomplice, and
its power of perpetually tearing itself away ﬁnds its fulcrum in my
universal commitment in the world. My actual freedom is not on the
hither side of my being, but before me, in things. We must not say that
I continually choose myself, on the excuse that I might continually
refuse what I am. Not to refuse is not the same thing as to choose. We
could identify drift and action only by depriving the implicit of all
phenomenal value, and at every instant arraying the world before us in
perfect transparency, that is, by destroying the world’s ‘worldliness’.
Consciousness holds itself responsible for everything, and takes everything upon itself, but it has nothing of its own and makes its life in the
world. We are led to conceive freedom as a choice continually remade
as long as we do not bring in the notion of a generalized or natural
time. We have seen that there is no natural time, if we understand
thereby a time of things without subjectivity. There is, however, at least
a generalized time, and this is what the common notion of time envisages. It is the perpetual reiteration of the sequence of past, present and
future. It is, as it were, a constant disappointment and failure. This is
what is expressed by saying that it is continuous: the present which it
brings to us is never a present for good, since it is already over when it
appears, and the future has, in it, only the appearance of a goal towards
which we make our way, since it quickly comes into the present,
whereupon we turn towards a fresh future. This time is the time of our
bodily functions, which like it, are cyclic, and it is also that of nature
with which we co-exist. It oﬀers us only the adumbration and the
abstract form of a commitment, since it continually erodes itself and
undoes that which it has just done. As long as we place in opposition,
with no mediator, the For Itself and the In Itself, and fail to perceive,
between ourselves and the world, this natural foreshadowing of a subjectivity, this prepersonal time which rests upon itself, acts are needed
to sustain the upsurge of time, and everything becomes equally a matter of choice, the respiratory reﬂex no less than the moral decision,
conservation no less than creation. As far as we are concerned, consciousness attributes this power of universal constitution to itself only
if it ignores the event which provides its infrastructure and which is its
birth. A consciousness for which the world ‘can be taken for granted’,
which ﬁnds it ‘already constituted’ and present even in consciousness

freedom

itself, does not absolutely choose either its being or its manner of
being.
What then is freedom? To be born is both to be born of the world
and to be born into the world. The world is already constituted, but
also never completely constituted; in the ﬁrst case we are acted upon, in
the second we are open to an inﬁnite number of possibilities. But this
analysis is still abstract, for we exist in both ways at once. There is,
therefore, never determinism and never absolute choice, I am never a
thing and never bare consciousness. In fact, even our own pieces of
initiative, even the situations which we have chosen, bear us on, once
they have been entered upon by virtue of a state rather than an act. The
generality of the ‘rôle’ and of the situation comes to the aid of decision, and in this exchange between the situation and the person who
takes it up, it is impossible to determine precisely the ‘share contributed by the situation’ and the ‘share contributed by freedom’. Let us
suppose that a man is tortured to make him talk. If he refuses to give
the names and addresses which it is desired to extract from him, this
does not arise from a solitary and unsupported decision: the man still
feels himself to be with his comrades, and, being still involved in the
common struggle, he is as it were incapable of talking. Or else, for
months or years, he has, in his mind, faced this test and staked his
whole life upon it. Or ﬁnally, he wants to prove, by coming through it,
what he has always thought and said about freedom. These motives do
not cancel out freedom, but at least ensure that it does not go unbuttressed in being. What withstands pain is not, in short, a bare consciousness, but the prisoner with his comrades or with those he loves
and under whose gaze he lives; or else the awareness of his proudly
willed solitude, which again is a certain mode of the Mit-Sein. And
probably the individual in his prison daily reawakens these phantoms,
which give back to him the strength he gave to them. But conversely, in
so far as he has committed himself to this action, formed a bond with
his comrades or adopted this morality, it is because the historical situation, the comrades, the world around him seemed to him to expect
that conduct from him. The analysis could be pursued endlessly in this
way. We choose our world and the world chooses us. What is certain,
in any case, is that we can at no time set aside within ourselves a
redoubt to which being does not ﬁnd its way through, without seeing

527

528 phenomenology of perception
this freedom, immediately and by the very fact of being a living
experience, ﬁgure as being and become a motive and a buttress. Taken
concretely, freedom is always a meeting of the inner and the outer—
even the prehuman and prehistoric freedom with which we began—
and it shrinks without ever disappearing altogether in direct proportion to the lessening of the tolerance allowed by the bodily and institutional data of our lives. There is, as Husserl says, on the one hand a
‘ﬁeld of freedom’ and on the other a ‘conditioned freedom’;7 not that
freedom is absolute within the limits of this ﬁeld and non-existent
outside it (like the perceptual ﬁeld, this one has no traceable boundaries), but because I enjoy immediate and remote possibilities. Our
commitments sustain our power and there is no freedom without
some power. Our freedom, it is said, is either total or non-existent. This
dilemma belongs to objective thought and its stable-companion, analytical reﬂection. If indeed we place ourselves within being, it must
necessarily be the case that our actions must have their origin outside
us, and if we revert to constituting consciousness, they must originate
within. But we have learnt precisely to recognize the order of phenomena. We are involved in the world and with others in an inextricable
tangle. The idea of situation rules out absolute freedom at the source of
our commitments, and equally, indeed, at their terminus. No commitment, not even commitment in the Hegelian State, can make me
leave behind all diﬀerences and free me for anything. This universality
itself, from the mere fact of its being experienced, would stand out as a
particularity against the world’s background, for existence both generalizes and particularizes everything at which it aims, and cannot ever be
ﬁnally complete.
The synthesis of in itself and for itself which brings Hegelian freedom
into being has, however, its truth. In a sense, it is the very deﬁnition of
existence, since it is eﬀected at every moment before our eyes in the
phenomenon of presence, only to be quickly re-enacted, since it does
not conjure away our ﬁnitude. By taking up a present, I draw together
and transform my past, altering its signiﬁcance, freeing and detaching
myself from it. But I do so only by committing myself somewhere else.
Psychoanalytical treatment does not bring about its cure by producing
7

Fink, Vergegenwärtigung und Bild, p. 285.

freedom

direct awareness of the past, but in the ﬁrst place by binding the subject
to his doctor through new existential relationships. It is not a matter of
giving scientiﬁc assent to the psychoanalytical interpretation, and discovering a notional signiﬁcance for the past; it is a matter of reliving
this or that as signiﬁcant, and this the patient succeeds in doing only by
seeing his past in the perspective of his co-existence with the doctor.
The complex is not dissolved by a non-instrumental freedom, but
rather displaced by a new pulsation of time with its own supports and
motives. The same applies in all cases of coming to awareness: they are
real only if they are sustained by a new commitment. Now this commitment too is entered into in the sphere of the implicit, and is therefore valid only for a certain temporal cycle. The choice which we make
of our life is always based on a certain givenness. My freedom can draw
life away from its spontaneous course, but only by a series of
unobtrusive deﬂections which necessitate ﬁrst of all following its
course—not by any absolute creation. All explanations of my conduct
in terms of my past, my temperament and my environment are therefore true, provided that they be regarded not as separable contributions, but as moments of my total being, the signiﬁcance of which I am
entitled to make explicit in various ways, without its ever being possible to say whether I confer their meaning upon them or receive it
from them. I am a psychological and historical structure, and have
received, with existence, a manner of existing, a style. All my actions
and thoughts stand in a relationship to this structure, and even a philosopher’s thought is merely a way of making explicit his hold on the
world, and what he is. The fact remains that I am free, not in spite of, or
on the hither side of, these motivations, but by means of them. For this
signiﬁcant life, this certain signiﬁcance of nature and history which I
am, does not limit my access to the world, but on the contrary is
my means of entering into communication with it. It is by being
unrestrictedly and unreservedly what I am at present that I have a
chance of moving forward; it is by living my time that I am able to
understand other times, by plunging into the present and the world, by
taking on deliberately what I am fortuitously, by willing what I will
and doing what I do, that I can go further. I can miss being free only if I
try to bypass my natural and social situation by refusing to take it up, in
the ﬁrst place, instead of assuming it in order to join up with the

529

530 phenomenology of perception
natural and human world. Nothing determines me from outside, not
because nothing acts upon me, but, on the contrary, because I am from
the start outside myself and open to the world. We are true through and
through, and have with us, by the mere fact of belonging to the world,
and not merely being in the world in the way that things are, all that we
need to transcend ourselves. We need have no fear that our choices or
actions restrict our liberty, since choice and action alone cut us loose
from our anchorage. Just as reﬂection borrows its wish for absolute
suﬃciency from the perception which causes a thing to appear, and as
in this way idealism tacitly uses that ‘primary opinion’ which it would
like to destroy as opinion, so freedom ﬂounders in the contradictions
of commitment, and fails to realize that, without the roots which it
thrusts into the world, it would not be freedom at all. Shall I make this
promise? Shall I risk my life for so little? Shall I give up my liberty in
order to save liberty? There is no theoretical reply to these questions.
But there are these things which stand, irrefutable, there is before you
this person whom you love, there are these men whose existence
around you is that of slaves, and your freedom cannot be willed without
leaving behind its singular relevance, and without willing freedom for
all. Whether it is a question of things or of historical situations, philosophy has no other function than to teach us to see them clearly once
more, and it is true to say that it comes into being by destroying itself
as separate philosophy. But what is here required is silence, for only the
hero lives out his relation to men and the world, and it is not ﬁtting
that another speak in his name. ‘Your son is caught in the ﬁre: you are
the one who will save him. . . . If there is an obstacle, you would be
ready to give your shoulder provided only that you can charge down
that obstacle. Your abode is your act itself. Your act is you. . . . You give
yourself in exchange. . . . Your signiﬁcance shows itself, eﬀulgent. It is
your duty, your hatred, your love, your steadfastness, your ingenuity. . . . Man is but a network of relationships, and these alone matter to
him.’8
