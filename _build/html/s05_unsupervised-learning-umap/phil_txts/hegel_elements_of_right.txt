Editor's introduction
Hegel was born on 27 August 1770 in Stuttgart, in the south German
state of Wiirttemberg, son of a middle-class civil servant. His pro­
fessional career, pursued entirely outside his home state, did not
begin until he was over thirty, and was interrupted between 1806 and
1816. His eventual rise to prominence was meteoric: Hegel was
offered a professorship at the University of Heidelberg in 1816,
followed by an appointment two years later to the prestigious chair in
philosophy at the University of Berlin which had had Fichte as its only
previous occupant. Hegel occupied this position until his death from
cholera on 14 November 1831. The influence of his philosophy
began to decline even before his death, but its impact on Prussian
academic life was perpetuated through the activity of some of his
students, especially Johannes Schulze, who was Privy Councillor in
charge of education from 1823 until the 1840sJ
Hegel's first lectures on right, ethics and the state were delivered in
1817, during his first autumn at Heidelberg. As his text he used the
paragraphs on 'objective spirit' from his newly published E1lcyclopaedia
of the Philosophical Sciences (1816). (EH §§400-452).2 His second
series of lectures came a year later in Berlin. He soon formed the
intention of expanding his treatment of this part of the system in a
longer text, which probably existed in draft well before his third series
of lectures on right and the state were delivered in 1819-1820.
A fateful tum of political events in Prussia forced him to delay
publication of this new work. Since the defeat of Prussia by Napoleon
in 1806-1807, a reform movement within the government had been
taking the country away from absolutism and toward constitutionalism.
VII

Editor's Introductio1l
After the defeat of Napoleon in ISIS, this made Prussia an object of
suspicion and alarm throughout the relatively less progressive con­
tinental states, especially Austria and Russia. In the summer of ISI9,
the cause of reform was decisively defeated by its opponents within
the feudal nobility (see Preface, note IS). In September there was a
conference of German states in Carlsbad. It imposed censorship on
all academic publications and set forth guidelines for the removal of
'demagogues' from the universities. This resulted in the dismissal of
several prominent academics, including Hegel's old personal enemy
J. F. Fries, but also in the arrest of some of Hegel's own students and
assistants (see Preface, notes 6, S, II, 1 2, IS, IS). In the light of the
new situation, Hegel revised his textbook on right, composing a new
preface in June, IS20. Published early in IS2I, it was to be his last
major work.

Images of Hegel's political thought
From the beginning the Philosophy ofRight was an object of contro­
versy. The earliest reviews, even those written by men Hegel had
counted among his friends, were almost uniformly negative.3 Hegel's
attack on Fries in the Preface was interpreted as showing unqualified
approval of the academic repression. His declaration: 'What is
rational is actual; and what is actual is rational' was read as bestowing
an unqualified blessing on the political status quo (see Preface, note
22). Many could see nothing in Hegel's book except an attempt to
ingratiate himself with the authorities. As Fries himself put it:
'Hegel's metaphysical mushroom has grown not in the gardens of
science but on the dunghill of servility.'4
The earliest attacks on the Philosophy of Right viewed it solely in
relation to the immediate political situation. Later critics in the liberal
tradition followed their interpretation, but gave to the image of Hegel
as conservative sycophant a broader philosophical significance.5
Right-Hegelian interpretations of Hegel's political thought under
Friedrich Wilhelm IV and German nationalist and statist interpreta­
tions during the Bismarck period tended only to confirm the idea that
Hegel's political thought consorts well with the spirit of absolutism
and the Prussian Machtstaat.6 In the first half of our century the same
image of Hegel naturally led critics to see him as a forerunner of
German imperialism and National Socialism.7 Together with the
viii

Editor's Introduction
thought that the roots of Marxism lie in Hegel's philosophy, this
secured for Hegel a prominent if unenviable place in the popular
demonology of totalitarianism.8
There were always those, however, who insisted that Hegel was
fundamentally a theorist of the modern constitutional state,
emphasizing in the state most of the same features which win the
approval of Hegel's liberal critics. This was always the position of the
Hegelian 'centre', including Hegel's own students and most direct
nineteenth-century followers.9 This more sympathetic tradition in
Hegel scholarship has reasserted itself decisively since the middle of
this century, to such an extent that there is now a virtual consensus
among knowledgeable scholars that the earlier images of Hegel, as
philosopher of the reactionary Prussian restoration and forerunner of
modern totalitarianism, are simply wrong, whether they are viewed as
accounts of Hegel's attitude toward Prussian politics or as broader
philosophical interpretations of his theory of the stateJo

Hegel and the Prus s ian s tate
Hegel's political thought needs to be understood in relation to the
institutions and issues of its own time. Yet this is something even
Hegel's contemporaries themselves were often unable to do. The
difficulty and obscurity of Hegel's writings posed problems for them,
just as they have for subsequent readers. The Preface of the Philo­
sophy ofRight, with its immediate relation to events of the day, pro­
vided the earliest critics with an easy and obvious way of grasping,
labelling, and categorizing its contents. From Hegel's attacks on Fries
and his evident attempt to placate the censors, they inferred that he
was an opponent of the Prussian reform movement, siding with the
reaction's repressive policies toward intellectual life generally and the
universities in particular. In the light of the-se conclusions,
judged (or prejudged) the political theory presented in the rest of the
book. Had the critics studied the actual contents of the Philosophy of
Right more closely, however, they could not have reconciled them
,vith the idea that Hegel's defence of the state is an apology either for
the conservative position or for the Prussian state as it existed in 1820.
In 1815, under the reform administration of Chancellor
Hardenberg, King Friedrich Wilhelm III solemnly promised to give his
people a written constitution. The political victory of the conservatives
ix

Editor's Introduction
in the summer of 1819 ensured that the promise would never be kept,
and it was a firm tenet of the conservative position that it never should
be kept, that it never should have been given in the first place. Yet
earlier in the year both Hardenberg and the progressive Interior
Minister Wilhelm von Humboldt drew up constitutional plans, pro­
viding for representative institutions, in the shape of a bicameral
estates assembly. These plans are strikingly similar to the Estates as
described by Hegel in PR §§298-314 (see §300, note I; §303, note
I; §312, note I).
The Prussian officer corps and the higher levels of the civil service
were open only to the hereditary nobility. Reformers under the
administration of Chancellor Karl Freiherr vom Stein (1808-1810)
had attempted without success to open them to the bourgeoisie. In
Hegel's rational state, all citizens are eligible for military command
and the civil service (PR § 271, note 2; §277, note I; §291 and note
I). Hegel advocates public criminal trials and trial by jury, neither of
which existed in Prussia during his lifetime (PR §228 and note I).
Hegel's rational state does strongly resemble Prussia, not as it ever
was, but Prussia as it was to have become under the reform
administrations of Stein and Hardenberg, if only they had been vic­
torious. Where Hegel's state does resemble the Prussia of 1820, it
provides for the liberalizing reforms which had been achieved
between 1808 and 1819 (PR §206 and note I; §219 and note 2;
§288 and note I; §289 and note I).
Hegel was no radical, and certainly no subversive. In relation to the
Prussian state of 1820 he represented the tendency toward moderate,
liberalizing reform, in the spirit of Stein, Hardenberg, Humboldt and
Altenstein (who had arranged for his appointment to his chair in
Berlin). Hegel did not have to be ashamed of publishing his views
(until the middle of 18 I9, most of them were even the official position
of the monarch and his chief ministers). But they were diametrically
opposed to the views of Prussian conservatives on some of the largest
and most sensitive political issues of the day.
If Hegel was not a conservative, does that mean that he was a
'liberal'? It does mean that Hegel was a proponent (usually a cautious
and moderate one) of many social and political policies and
tendencies that we now recognize as part of the liberal tradition. But
the term 'liberalism' normally connotes not only these policies, but
also a deeper philosophical rationale for them, or rather a plurality of
x

Editor's Introduction
rationales which to some degree share a common spirit and social
vision. The vision is individualistic, conceiving society as nothing but
the outcome of the actions and interactions of human individuals
pursuing their individual ends. The spirit is one which tends to be
suspicious of grand theories of human destiny or the good, preferring
instead to protect individual rights and freedoms, and living by the
faith that human progress is most likely if individuals are left to find
their own way toward whatever they happen to conceive of as the
good. In line with what has just been said, it is also a moralistic spirit,
for which individual conscience, responsibility and decency are
paramount values. The power of this vision and this spirit in modem
society can perhaps best be measured by the fact that 'liberalism' in
this sense is the common basis of both 'liberalism' and 'conservatism'
as those terms are now used in everyday political parlance, and by the
fact that liberalism's principles sound to most of us like platitudes,
which no decent person could think of denying.
Hegel does not see liberalism in this sense as a foe, since he sees its
standpoint as expressing something distinctive and valuable about the
modem world. But he does regard its standpoint as limited, and for
this reason potentially destructive of the very values it most wants to
promote. He regards this standpoint as salvageable only when placed
in the context of a larger "ision, which measures the subjective goals
of individuals by a larger objective and collective good, and assigns to
moral values a determinate, limited place in the total scheme of
things. In this sense, Hegel is a critic of liberalism, even its deepest
and most troubling modem critic. This is what gives the greatest
continuing interest to Hegel's ethical thought and social theory.

whatever we please (PR § 15,R) or with venting our particularity and
idiosyncrasy (PR § 15A). Hegel regards this view as�w and
immature; he insists that we are free o!!lY�u­
vely', according to the 'concept'
,larity:_�I!d
---�-�---- ------�
of the will (PR § 23).
'-.r-F�tion is action in which we deal with nothing that is external
to our own objective nature. That does not mean that freedom con­
sists in withdrawing from what is other than ourselves. On the con­
trary, Hegel insists that 'absence of dependence on an other is won
not outside the other but in it, it attains actuality not by fleeing the
other but by overcoming it' (EG § 382A). Thus Hegel describes
freedom as 'being with oneself in an other', that is, actively relating to
something other than oneself in suc� a way that this other becomes
integrated into one's projects, completing and fulfilling them so that it
counts as belonging to one's own action rather than standing over
against it. This means that freedom is possible only to the extent that
we act rationally, and in circumstances where the objects of our action
are in harmony with our reason. The most spiritual of such objects is
the social order in which we live: just as Hegel's treatment of
Jndi�ual �an psychology falls under the heading of 'subjective
spirit', so his treatment of the rational society, in the Philosophy of
Right, constitutes the sphere of��tive spirit' (EG § 385). Freedom
is actual, therefore, only in a rational society whose institutions can be
felt and known as rational by individuals who are 'with themselves' in
those institutions.
Hegel's name for a rational system of social institutions is 'ethical
life' (Siltlichkeit) (PR § § 144-145). Corresponding to 'objective' ethi­
cal life (the system of rational institutions) is a 'subjective' ethical life,
an individual character which disposes the individual to do what the
institutions require (PR §§ 146-148). The ethical disposition is
Hegel's answer to the Kantian separation of duty from inclination,
and more generally to the moralistic psychology which supposes that
unless we are moved by impartial reason to follow moral principles
adopted from a universalistic standpoint, we will inevitably adopt the
utterly selfish policy of maximizing our own interests. On the con­
trary, Hegel is convinced that the most potent, as well as the most
admirable, human dispositions follow neither of these two patterns. A
rational society is one where the demands of social life do not
frustrate the needs of individuals, where duty fulfils individuality

�

xii

Editor's Introduction
rather than suppressing it. In such a society rational individuals can

�rest to a satisfactory degree without having to

maximize it, and they need not make great sacrifices in order to give
priority to right and duty or to show concern for the good of others.
Because our social life is in harmony with our individuality, the duties
of ethical life do not limit our freedom but actualize it. \\!hen we
become conscious of this, we come to be \vith ourselves' in our
ethical duties. Such duties, Hegel insists, do not restrict us, but
liberate us (PR § 149).
We might put the point by saying that for Hegel I am free when I
'identify' myself with the institutions of my community, feeling myself
to be a part of them, and feeling them to be a part of me. But Hegel
would deny that such feelings constitute freedom unless they are a
'certainty based on tnltlz' (p R § 268). That is, the institutions of the
community must tndy harmonize the state's universal or collective
interest with the true, objective good of individuals; and individuals
must be C01lsciOllS of this harmony. Of course there is no freedom at all
in a society whose members 'identifi themselves with it only because
they are victims of illusion, deception, or ideology. II

Pers onhood and s ubjectivity
Liberals are usually proud of the fact that they mean by freedom what
most people mean by it, not what Hegel means. They usually think
treedom is the absence of obstacles to doing..as we like, whether our
choices are good or bad, rational or arbitrary. Confronted ,vith
Hegel's doctrines, they often think that his praise of freedom is a
dangerous deception; they fear that he wants to restrict freedom as
they mean it in the name of freedom as he means it. Such fears are
largely unfounded. Hegel's ethical theory is not based on freedom in
the ordinary sense, but it does not follow from this that Hegel's theory
is hostile or even indifferent to freedom in the ordinary sense. On the
contrary, Hegel thinks that in the modem world, people cannot be
free in his sense unless social institutions provide considerable scope
and protection forarbitrary freedom.
This is because Hegel thinks that, in the modem world, we are
conscious of ourselves in new ways, and that we cannot be "vith
,��
ourselves' in social institutions unless they provide for the actualization of our self-image in these respects. First, we think of ourselves as
xiii

Editor's Introduction

persons, indeterminate choosers, capable of abstracting from all our

desires and qualities (PR §5), and demanding an external sphere for
the exercise of our arbitrary freedom (PR §41). This sphere begins
with the person's external body and extends to all the person's prop­
erty (PR §§45-47). The category of 'abstract right' applies to such a
sphere of arbitrary freedom. It is called 'abstract right' because in
protecting the rights of persons we must abstract from the particular
use they make of these rights, even from its bearing on the person's
own interests (PR §37). Abstract right is a variety of freedom in the
Hegelian sense because it involves 'being with oneself' in the external
objects which one owns. The rationality of the modem state requires
that the abstract right of persons be safeguarded; this is the prim�
� (PR §209,R).
Modern individuals not only regard themselves as arbitrarily free
choosers, but they also see themselves as giving meaning to their lives
through the particular choices they make. So regarded, individuals
are subjects (PR §§105-106). Subjects derive what Hegel calls 'self­
satisfaction' from their role in determining for themselves what will
count as their own particular good or happiness (PR §§121-123).
Their sense of self-worth is bound up with the fact that they are aware
of leading a reflective life, shaped through their own deeds. Subjec�
tivity is also the sphere of morality, in which individuals measure their
choices by universal standards and reflect on their actions from the
standpoint of conscience.
Hegel gives the name 'subjective freedom' to the variety of 'being
with oneself in an other' in which the 'other' is the individual's own
actions and choices. Modern individuals cannot be free in the
Hegelian sense unless social institutions provide for subjective
freedom in several ways. Modem ethical life must provide for
individual self-satisfaction by enabling people to shape and actualize
their own determinate individualities (PR §187). Thus the state must
respect my right as an individual self to direct my own life, and
provide for this right in the fonn of its institutions (PR §§185R,
206R). It must also honour moral conscience (PR §137R) and hold
me responsible for my actions only in so far as the are the e)pressiOr!:..
of my subjectivity (PR §§115-120). A state which fails to do these
�'extent a state in which individuals cannot be free or
'with themselves'.
For modern individuals, Hegelian freedom cannot exist unless
xiv

L

Editor's Introduction
there is room for freedom in the ordinary sense. Hegel wants to
replace the ordinary concept of freedom with his concept not because
he is opposed to freedom in the ordinary sense, but because he thinks
that starting with his concept of freedom enables us to see why
freedom in the ordinary sense is objectively a good thing for people to
have. In that way, Hegel's view is not at odds ,vith those who value
freedom in the sense of the unhindered ability to do as we please. On
the contrary, Hegel's ethical theory shows how their position can be
justified.
At the same time, Hegel's view also proposes to tell us something
about when freedom in the ordinary sense is objectively valuable, and
when it is not. Like John Stuart Mill, Hegel thinks the ability to do as
we please is good not in itself but because it is required for the
achievement of other vital human goods. The chance to do as we
please is valuable when it is necessary for or conducive to freedom in
the Hegelian sense; otherwise, it may be worthless or even harmful.
Hegel's view implies that freedom in the ordinary sense should be
protected when it belongs to the rightful sphere of some person or
when it is conducive to a subject's self-satisfaction or to the actualiza­
tion of that subject's individuality. It also implies that in a case where
doing as we please is not conducive to these goods, there is no reason
to value such freedom at all.
Hegel does not believe that we can decide in the abstract and
irrespective of a structured social context when freedom in the ordi­
nary sense falls ,vithin our right and serves to actualize our individu­
ality. He does name certain things which are central to our
personality, and hence belong ,vithout exception to our inalienable
and imprescriptible rights: the right to our own body and free status
(PR § 57); the right to hold private property (PR §§ 45-49); and the
right over one's own ethical life, religion, and conscience (PR § 66).
But he does not agree with Kant that we should try to construct our
social institutions so that they maximize the amount of personal
freedom which everyone can enjoy according to a universal lawP
Instead, Hegel thinks that the precise content of our right as persons
and subjects depends on a system of rational institutions, apart from
which we cannot even b�at 'maximal personal freedom' might
mean, much less determine how it might be achieved.
It is the function of positive law, for example, to make right deter­
minate. Our rights as persons have validity only when they are expressed
xv

Editor's Introduction
in law. Conversely, however, Hegel holds that pOSItIVe laws are
obligatory only to the extent that they agree in content with what is in
itself right (PR §§ 209-213). Although personal rights are not deter­
minate except within a system of law, Hegel does think that some laws
(e.g. those establishing slavery or forbidding persons to hold private
property) are plainly unjust in the context of any system of law. In
such cases, he agrees with the natural law tradition that those laws do
not obligate us.
Hegel's liberal critics are in the habit of saying that he does not
believe in founding a social order on the conception of individual
rights. The element of truth in this assertion is that Hegel thinks
personal right, apart from a developed system of ethical life, is an
��n; he believes that a social order founded (as in
liberal political theory) on such abstractions will be unable even to
protect individual rights, much less to actualize the whole of concrete
freedom. In fact, Hegel thinks that the greatest enemy of personal and
subjective freedom is a 'mechanistic' conception 0 e state, which
views the state solely as an instrument for the enforcement of abstract
rights; for this sets the state up as an abstraction in opposition to
individuals. In Fichte's theory, for example, Hegel sees the state as a
police power whose only function is to supervise and regulate the
actions of individuals through coercive force (NR 5 19h24)' �
real arantee of freedom is a well-constituted ethical life, which
integrates the rights of persons and subjects into an organic system of
customs and institutions providing individuals with concretely fulfil­
ling lives.
Hegel is not an enemy of what liberals value in the name of
freedom, but his agenda regarding freedom is not the liberal one. He
believes there are limits to the state's legitimate power to interfere in
the conduct of individuals, but he insists that these limits cannot be
drawn precisely (PR § 234). This does not bother him because he
does not share the liberals' fear that the state will inevitably trespass
into the rightful territory of individual freedom unless we guard the
boundaries jealously. On the contrary, Hegel maintains that the
'enormous strength' of the modem state lies in the fact that the state's
'substantive unity' rests on the principles of 'subjectivity' and 'per­
sonal particularity' (PR § 260). An inevitable tendency to violate these
principles could belong only to a state which is inherently self­
destructive, out to destrov the source of its own power.

Editor's Introduction
From Hegel's point of view, a more serious threat to freedom in
modem society is what he calls the 'principle of atomici!y', the
tendency in modem life for individuals to be only abstract persons
and subjects, who fail to actualize their personality and subjectivity in
a fulfilling social context. If people insist too stubbornly on their rights
or withdraw too far into their subjectivity, Hegel believes that they
become alienated from the-coiliffion social life, ,vithout which nothing
they do has any significance for them. This is a threat to people's
freedom because it means that they cannot be 'with themselves' in
their social life; it renders them powerless to make their lives their
own. Where this is so, people's options, however vast and unhindered
they may be, are all alike hollow and meaningless to them; wider
choices only confront them with an emptiness more vast and
appalling.
Hegel's primary aim in the Philosophy oj Right is to show how
personal right and subjective freedom can receive real content
through the institutions of the modem state. In other words, it is to
show us how the modem state is after all the actuality of concrete
freedom (PR § 258). This state as Hegel describes it differs little
from the state which liberal theories try to justify, but Hegel's state is
not the same as theirs because his justification is different. Hegel's
state is about different things, serves different human needs, sets
itself different ends.
Civil s ociety
Human beings have not always known themselves as persons and
subjects. These conceptions, according to Hegel, are historically
quite recent, and are still geographically restricted. They are products
of European culture, deriving from the tradition of Greek ethical life
and Christian spirituality. But they','uid not become actual even in
European culture as long as there was slavery or serfdom, or property
and economic relationships were bound by feudal fetters and encum­
brances, or states were subject to ecclesiastical authorities or treated
as the private property of an individual or a family. Personality and
subjectivity were not actual in the democratic Greek polis, or the
medieval Church, or the feudal state of the early modem era. They
have become actual only in the modem state which arose out of the
Lutheran Reformation and the French Revolution.
xvii

Editor's Introduction
The modem state contains one specific institution which separates
it decisively from earlier and less developed social orders: Hegel's
name for it is 'civil society'. Prior to Hegel, the term 'civil society'
(biirger/iclze GeSdlschafi, and its cognates in Latin, French, and other
languages) was generally interchangeable with the term 'state'. 'Civil'
society was the realm of citizens (Biirger, cives, citoyens), in contrast to
'natural' society or the family.13 Hegel, however, distinguishes civil
society from both the family, the private socie!}' based on love (PR
§ 158), and from the state, i.e. the public community based explicitly
on reason and aiming at collective or universal ends. Civil society is
the realm in which individuals exist as persons and subjects, as
owners and disposers of private property, and as choosers of their own
life-activity in the light of their contingent and subjective needs and
interests. In civil society, people's ends are in the first instance purely
private, particular and contingent (PR § 185), not communal ends
shared with others through feeling (as in the family) or through
reason (as in the state).
In other words, civil society is the realm of the market economy.
Hegel holds that individuals are given their due as free persons, and
achieve actuality as subjects, only when they depend on themselves
for their own livelihood and welfare (PR § 182). He is a strong
partisan of the view that the collectivized or state-run econom is a
pre-modem institution, incompatible with the modem principle of

�

At the same time, civil society is not simply identical with the
market economy. As a member of civil society, the individual has a
determinate social identity signified by the term BUrger, not in the
sense of the French word citoyen but in the sense of the French word
bourgeois (PR § I90R). A bourgeois for Hegel is much more than a self­
interested, calculating homo eC01l0miCllS. Hegel's study of the science of
political economy (in the writings of people such as Adam Smith, Say
and Ricardo) convinces him that people's collective market behaviour
possesses a kind of collective rationJ!!!ty, which is none the less real
for being unintended (PR § I89R). This 'inner necessity' forms the
unconscious basis of genuine social relationships between people, and
gives rise to a 'principle of universality' within civil society, harmoniz­
ing with the principle of free individuality (pR §§ 182-184). Civil
society is not merely the natural result of people's free and self­
interested behaviour (a conception Hegel had earlier satirized under
xviii

Editor's Itztroduaion
the title 'the spiritual animal kingdom' (phG � 397)). It is a genuine
fonn of society, a 'universal family' which makes collective demands
on its members and has collective responsibilities toward them (PR
§ 239)·
As members of this society, individuals have the duty to support
themselves through labour which benefits the whole, while civil
society as a whole owes each individual the opportunity to labour in a
way which provides a secure, respected and self-fulfilling mode of life
(PR § 238). This means that civil society is charged with the educa­
tion of individuals for membership in it (PR § 239), and also collec­
tively responsible for preventing them from falling into poverty,
whether through their own improvidence (P R § 240) or through the
contingencies of the market system. The poor in civil society are
victims not of some natural misfortune, but of a social wro1lg (P R
§ 241).
Though the market economy has a tendency toward rationality,
Hegel sees that it is the scene of systematic conflicts of interest
between producers and consumers, and also of occasional imbalances
which adversely affect everyone; the activities of civil society must be
consciously supervised if it is to remain just and stable (PR § § 235236). Thus he regards state-run economy and complete freedom of
trade and commerce as extremes; the health of civil society requires a
middle course (PR § 236R). The responsibility for overseeing and
regulating civil society's economic activities belongs to what Hegel
calls the state's 'police' function (see P R § 231, note I).

Estates and corporations
Individual freedom in civil society involves much more than simply
being left alone to find our way through life in a market system. If we
are to be 'with ourselves' as members of civil society, we must also
achieve a determinate social identity, a specific trade or profession
(Gewerbe), conferring upon us a determinate social estate, standing or
status (Sta1ld) (P R § 207). Through membership in an estate, our
economic activity ceases to be mere individual self-seeking. It
becomes a determinate kind of contribution to the welfare of civil
society as a whole, recognized for what it is by, others.
In the case of the urban trades and professions, Hegel thinks this
calls for the organization of civil society into 'corporations' xix

/

/
Editor's Introduction

professional associations or guilds, recognized by the state. A cor­
poration provides its members with a collective responsibility and aim
within civil society: to look after the special business of their pro­
fession, to train new people to work in it, and to set standards for the
work it does. Corporations also look after their own interests, provid­
ing assistance to members who are out of work, \vithout undermining
their dignity as tends to happen when they depend on either private
charity or public assistance (PR § 253R). In Hegel's state, as in the
constitutional proposals of Humboldt and Hardenberg, corporations
are also the chief vehicles for popular political representation (see PR
§ 303, note I). Probably the only reform of the Stein or Hardenberg
administrations about which Hegel had serious reservations was the
abolition of guild monopolies, which were terminated in the interests
of free trade (see PR § 255, note 2).
Above all, corporation membership provides individuals with a
sense of concrete social identity. Civil society provides for subjective
freedom by offering individuals a wide variety of different lifestyles
between which to choose. But Hegel does not sympathize with Mill's
notion that society should encourage individuals to engage in all sorts
of eccentric experiments \vith their lives, in the hope that by trial and
error they may occasionally find something worth imitating.H He
thinks their choices must be between recognized ways of life,
systematically integrated into the organic system of modem ethical
life; the various ways of life should be known to provide dignity and
fulfilment to those who lead them. Corporation membership helps
indh�duals to achieve a recognized estate or status (Stand) of this
kind. Without this, indh�duals \vill be isolated from others, alienated
from ch� society, and lacking in any determinate standards for suc­
cess in life. They \vill gauge their self-worth in civil society not by
ethical standards, but only by the selfish pursuit of wealth, which can
never satisfy them because it has no determinate measure (PR § 253).
In Hegel's state, however, corporation membership is open mainly
to the male urban middle class. Hegel argues that civil servants do not
need corporations since the place of corporations for them is taken by
the organization of the government service; he also thinks that the
unreflective ethical disposition of the rural population is unsuited to
the corporate spirit (PR § 250). But he also recognizes that wage­
labourers are not eligible for corporation membership (pR § 252R).

Editor's Introduction
Hegel is disturbed by civil society's systematic tendency toward
extremes of wealth and poverty. He notes that the economic processes
of civil society themselves produce a class which is systematically
excluded from civil society's wealth, its spiritual benefits, and conse­
quendy even from its ethical life (PR § § 243-244). Hegel's treatment
of this topic is characteristically hard-headed, perceptive and unsen­
timental. His main concern is with the social causes of poverty and
with its consequences for the ethical health of civil society. He sees
the fundamental cause of poverty as the process of 'universalization'
applied both to people's needs (through the standardization. and
mass-marketing of commodities) and to their labour (through mass­
production). The greatest profits come as a result of employing cheap
mass-labour, so that the wealthy have an interest in the existence of a
poor class, whose bargaining power is weak in relation to capital (PR
§ 243). 'When there is great poverty, the capitalist finds many people
who work for small wages, which increases his earnings; and this has
the further consequence that smaller capitalists fall into poverty'
(VPR IV, 610). For Hegel, poverty in civil society is not an accident,
or a misfortune or the result of human error or vice; rather, 'the
complications of civil society itself produce poverty' (VPRI7 138),
which (along ,vith personal right and subjective freedom) is a special
characteristic of modern civil society. 'The emergence of poverty is in
general a consequence of civil society; from which on the whole
poverty arises necessarily' (VPRI9 193).
Hegel refuses to blame either the wealthy or the poor, as individu­
als, for the fact of poverty. But he does regard poverty as a cause of
moral degradation, turning those subject to it into a 'rabble' (Pabel).
Since Hegel thinks every member of civil society has a right to earn an
adequate living as a member of a recognized estate, he regards the
poor as victims of wrong at society's hands. The basis of the 'rabble
mentality' (PObellzaJtigkeit) is the outrage of the poor (against the rich,
civil society, and the state) at the wrong they suffer (PR § 241). Under
the conditions of life to which the poor are subject, however, the
effect of this justified outrage is to produce a disposition which is
fundamentally at odds with the ethical principles of civil society.
Because they have no chance of the dignity and self-sufficiency
afforded by recognized labour in civil society, the rabble lose both a
sense of self-respect and a sense of right and wrong as applied to their

[

Editor's Introduction
own actions. They cease to recognize the rights of others, and the
only right they are interested in is their own imagined right to live at
civil society's expense without working at all.
Thus the rabble mentality becomes a criminal mentality. Hegel
suggests that a similar attitude may also develop among the wealthy.
The rich find that they can buy anything, that they do not need to
work, that no one's personality or subjectivity is immune to the power
of their wealth. The rich and the poor equally come to regard the
ethical principles of civil society with scorn (see PR § 244, note 1).
'Hence wealth can lead to the same mockery and shamelessness as we
find among the rabble. The disposition of the master over the slave is
the same as that of the slave' (VPRI9 196).
For Hegel's student and colleague Eduard Gans (to whom Hegel
left the task of lecturing on the Philosophy ofRight in Berlin during the
last half of the 1820S), the philosophical proposition that the modern
state is rational entails the conclusion that the problem of poverty
must be soluble, that it must be possible to prevent the formation of a
rabble. 'Hence the police must be able to bring it about that there is
no rabble. [The rabble] is a fact, not a right. We must be able to go to
the basis of this fact and abolish it.'J5 Hegel's own reflections on the
problem of poverty are less aprioristic, and less optimistic. Poverty
provides plenty of occasion for exercise of morally good intentions,
but Hegel thinks that private charity is no solution to the problem of
poverty, and often even makes it worse (see PR § 242, note 1). The
state, in its action on civil society (which Hegel calls the state's 'police
power') is the agency responsible for preventing poverty; but Hegel
considers the various means at its disposal for doing so, and argues
that none of them can solve the underlying social problems (PR
§ 245). Hegel holds that poverty and the rabble mentality are system­
atic products of civil society, but he does not pretend that civil society
has any remedy for the ills it creates.
The political s tate
As the distinctively modern social institution, civil society is decisive
for the form of the other institutions of modern ethical life. Because
modern individuals are persons \vith rights of property, there is no
longer a place for the extended family as an economic organization. In
modern society, 'family' can refer only to the patriarchal bourgeois

)

nuclear family; the feudal family, the 'clan' or wider kinship group
(Stamm) celebrated by some of Hegel's Romantic contemporaries as
the model for all social relations - no longer has any legitimacy (PR
§ § 172, 177)·
The family's sole remaining function is to enable individuals to find
a haven from the harsh interaction of independent persons in civil
society, by participating in bonds of substantial unity on the level of
immediate feeling. For this reason, Hegel argues that property within
the family should be held in common, administrated by the husband
-"2 and father. He alone, under normal circumstances, exercises the
rights of personality in the sphere of civil society (PR § § 170-171);
the wife and mother is naturally confined to the sphere of the family,
as the guardian of its principle (PR § 166). She and the children
'"'7
exercise their personal rights in their own name only at those POints
where the family reaches its limit and dissolution: when a marriage
ends in divorce (PR § 176), when the children leave the family to
found new families of their own (PR § 177), or when the father dies
(PR § 178).
Civil society in Hegel's theory also determines the political form of
the modern state. Hegel argues that the form most suited to the
modern state is constitutional monarchy (PR § 273). Only there does
a political system� explicit and rational come to be personified
in an individual, who thus gives the state the form of subjective
freedom (PR § 279). The offices of the state must no longer be (as in
the feudal state, and in the Prussia of Hegel's time) the property or
the personal prerogatives of individuals or families; the civil service
must be a body of qualified professionals, open to all members of
society irrespective of birth (PR § 291).
In a society which emphasizes the dignity of free subjectivity,
individuals are naturally interested in the conduct of the state's
affairs, and they want a voice in determining its policies. Conse­
quently, the modern state must have representative institutions (PR
§ 301). Hegel argues that deputies to the Estates (StiiTzde) should be
chosen not by popular election from geographical districts but (as
their name implies) they should represent determinate groups (cor­
porations) within civil society. Otherwise, individuals, who are con­
nected to the political process only through the casting of one vote in
an immense multitude, will be alienated from the state by the very
process whose function is to connect them to it (PR § 3IIR).

Editor's Introduction
In a Hegelian constitutional monarchy, the hereditary prince or
sovereign represents the 'moment of ultimate decision' (PR § 275).
But Hegel intends this only in a 'formal' or 'subjective' sense; 'objec­
tively', he says, the sovereign is bound by his ministers, so that in a
well-constituted state the individual qualities of the sovereign will be
of no consequence (PR §§ 279A, 280A). Hegel plainly intends real
political power to be in the hands neither of the prince nor of the
people, but of an educated class of professional civil servants.
For Hegel, as for Mill, the function of representative institutions is
not to govern, but to advise those who govern, and to determine who it
is that governs.16 Hegel expects deputies to the Estates to be ordinary
citizens, not professional politicians. One evident reason for this is
that he wants the Estates to be close to the people, and to represent its
true sentiments; another reason (unstated, but quite evident) is that
he does not want the Estates to be politically strong enough to chal­
lenge the power of the professionals who actually govern. But he does
not intend the Estates to be powerless either. In his lectures, Hegel
describes a multi-party system in the Estates, and he insists that the
government's ministry must always represent the 'majority party';
when it ceases to do so, he says, it must resign and a new ministry,
representing the majority in the Estates, must take its place (see PR
§ 301, note 2). This idea takes the Hegelian constitutional monarchy
most of the way toward presently existing parliamentary systems with
a nominal hereditary monarch (as in Britain, Holland, Belgium, or
Sweden).

The s tate and the individual
To be absolutely and substantively free, individuals must be 'with
themselves' in their social life. One aspect of this is the satisfaction of
their subjectivity, in that ample scope is allowed for arbitrary choice
and the satisfaction of individual welfare. As rational and thinking
beings, however, we relate ourselves universally to the whole of the
social world. Our freedom is not fully actual until we are with our­
selves in ends which are universal in scope. We cannot be free (in
Hegel's sense) unless we successfully pursue ends larger than our
own private good, indeed larger than anyone's private good.
Through corporations, individuals in civil society acquire ethical
ends which go beyond their self-interest. These ends, Hegel says,
xxiv

Editor's Introduction
pass over in turn into the absolutely universal end: the state (PR
§ 256). Hegel distinguishes 'the political state proper' from the state
in a broader sense, the community as a whole with all its institutions
(PR § 267). He regards the state in the latter sense as the individual's
final end.
Hegel asserts that the individual's highest freedom consists in
membership in the state (PR § 258). Accordingly, the highest con­
sciousness of freedom is the consciousness of this membership, in
what he calls the 'political disposition' or 'patriotism'. Hegel denies,
however, that tru;Patriotism consists in the willingness to do heroic
deeds and make extraordinary sacrifices for the sake of one's country.
Instead, he says patriotism is nothing more than a habit of leading
one's normal life and doing one's ethical duty, while taking the state
as one's 'substantial basis and end' (PR § 268).
Hegel locates the absolutely universal end in the state because it
alone is a self-sufficient individuality, not part of any larger whole. To
those who would relate their actions to some still larger entity
('humanity at large', a 'cosmopolitan world society' or 'all sentient
creation') Hegel points out that such entities are
t real,�
abstractions.
e do not actualize our freedom by entertaining the
�nings of moralists, but only by relating ourselves to some­
thing real which truly actualizes the power of reason in the world. The
state, Hegel says, is 'the absolute power on earth' (PR § 33I).
For the same reason, the state is also the fundamental vehicle of
world history. Human history for Hegel is a progressive succession of
spiritual principles, which actualize themselves successively in the
political constitution and spiritual culture of nation states (PR § 344).
Thus human actions gain universal, cosmopolitan significance not
through their relation to abstract moral principles, but only in so far as
they are the actions of someone culturally and historically situated,
and give existence to the ethical life of a determinate people at a given
stage of its history. If I want to see my actions in their universal
historical significance, I must regard myself as the child of my age and
people, and my deeds as the expression of the principle embodied in
my state and my time.
The state, for Hegel, is an 'absolute end'; indh'iduals should place
it above their own private interests. '[The state has] the highest right
in relation to individuals, whose highest duZy is to be members of the
state' (PR § 258). But the state is an absolute end only because it is
XlI:V

Editor's l1ltroduction

ratiollal; Hegel describes 'rationality' as the 'unity and interpenetra­
tion of universality and individuality' (PR § 2S8R). In other words,
what makes the state an end in itself is the way in which it systemati­
cally harmonizes the personal right, subjective freedom and happiness
of its individual members. The state is an 'infinite' end distinct from
and higher than its members' rights and happiness only because it
systematically unifies these finite ends.
This is why patriotism, for Hegel, is not a disposition to do extra­
ordinary deeds on the state's behalf, but only the 'certainty, based on
truth' that in pursuing all my other ends (in my personal, family or
professional life) I thereby always relate myself at the same time to the
state as my universal and ultimate end. That consciousness is what
makes the state 'the actuality of concrete freedom' (PR § 260).
[patriotism is] the consciousness that my substantial and par­
ticular interest is preserved and contained in the interest and end
of an other (in this case, the state), and in the latter's relation to
me as an individual. As a result, this other immediately ceases to
be an other for me, and in my consciousness of this, I am free.
(PR § 268)
This makes it a gross distortion to associate Hegel's view with the
image of individuals having to sacrifice themselves to the ends of the
state. Such sacrifices may be required in some circumstances, but it is
precisely the abllonllality of such circumstances which makes the state
an end in itself.
The principal such circumstance for Hegel is war. It is mainly here,
Hegel thinks, that the universal interest of the state can for once be
clearly distinguished from the lesser interests of individuals. Although
war is an abnormal condition in the life of nations, Hegel thinks that
occasional wars are inevitable, even that they are necessary to
preserve the ethical health of peoples (PR § 324R).
We badly misunderstand Hegel's view if we think it implies that
wars are a good thing, or that we should not try our best to avoid
them. Even during war, Hegel says, war always has the character of
something that ought to cease (pR § 338). It may help us to under­
stand Hegel's view of war if we realize that what he believes about war
is closely analogous to what we all believe about human mortality
generally. We know we cannot live forever, and we realize that if we
all could, then this would eventually have disastrous consequences for
xxvi

Editor's Introduction
the human race as a whole. Hegel's views about war no more imply
that wars are a good thing, which we should not try our best to avoid,
than our views about human mortality imply that our own death is a
good thing, which we should not try our best to avoid.

Hegel's l egacy
Hegel is an important philosopher; his penetrating analysis of the
human predicament in modern society is perhaps unsurpassed among
social observers of the past two centuries. At the same time, his
thought is subtle and complex; his writings are difficult, even infuri­
ating - laden with impenetrable and pretentious jargon from which
his meaning can be separated only with skilled and careful surgery,
even then usually not without risk of mortal injury.
The inevitable result is that Hegel is cited much more frequently
than he is read, and discussed far oftener than he is understood.
Some of those who discourse on Hegel with the greatest sophistica­
tion know him only through warped, inaccurate or bowdlerized
second-hand accounts (for instance, accounts of the Hegelian dialec­
tic as 'thesis-antithesis-synthesis').J7 The 'Hegelian' ideas which
capture the popular imagination are often not present in Hegel at all,
or have only the most tenuous and dubious connection with what
Hegel actually thought or wrote. Before it gains currency, a fact about
Hegelian doctrine has often been so distorted by oversimplification
and misunderstanding that the truth from which it started is almost
impossible to recognize.
This is the case with the traditional images of Hegel as reactionary,
absolutist, totalitarian. Taken literally, of course, these images have
been long discredited. Yet in our liberal culture they nevertheless
possess a kind of symbolic truth, because they represent this culture's
self-doubts projected with righteous venom into its iconography of
the enemy. Hegel is especially unappealing to that dogmatic kind of
liberal who judges past social and political thinkers by the degree to
which they articulate the views which (it has been decided before­
hand) all people of good will must share. The value of Hegel's social
thought will be better appreciated by those who are willing to question
received views, and take a deeper look at the philosophical problems
posed by modern social life.
Hegel leaves the liberal's state pretty much intact, but his social
XXVII

Editor's Introduction
theory is mercilessly critical of the ahistorical, individualistic and
moralistic rationale which liberalism provides for it. In its place,
Hegel gives us an alternative interpretation of modern social life, of
modern economic and political institutions, of modern humanity's
conception of the human good, of the meaning of its fundamental and
insatiable drive for freedom.
This means that although Hegel's theory was put forward as a
rational defence of the modern state, his true legacy belongs rather to
the critics of modern society. The basic tendency of Hegel's social
thought is to undermine modern society's liberal self-interpretation;
to the extent that its institutions have been shaped by this interpreta­
tion, its tendency is even to criticize those institutions themselves. He
presents a communitarian rather than an individualistic rationale for
modern economic and political institutions and of the freedom they
seek to actualize. This provides the basis for an indictment of any
society which tries to call itself 'free' even though it fails to offer its
members any rationally credible sense of collective purpose, leaves
them cynically discontented with and alienated from its political
institutions, deprives them of a socially structured sense of self-iden­
tity, and condemns many of them to lives of poverty, frustration and
alienation. It leads us to question the value of the formalisms representative democracy, the market economy, the protection of
individual liberties - with which liberals wish to identifY 'freedom',
and to emphasize instead the social contents and consequences which
liberals would usually prefer to leave 'open' by excluding them from
the domain of collective concern and control.
Once we realize this, we can understand why it is that Hegel's most
bitter twentieth-century foes have been those who want to save the
liberal state from its radical opponents on the right or the left. We can
also see through the ironic deception they perpetrate when they avail
themselves of the distorted nineteenth-century image of Hegel as
quietist and conservative apologist. What they fear in Hegel's thought
is not quietism, but the very opposite - subversion of the liberal status
quo.
Clearly, Hegel's social thought is now outdated in important
respects. As Hegel writes about them, the family, civil society, and the
state are clearly institutions of the early nineteenth century. Hegel
insists on the one hand that all human individuals are persons and
xxviii

Editor's Introduction
subjects who must be treated universally as such; on the other hand,
he defends a state which excludes women from public life entirely,
and large segments of the population from all political participation.
With hindsight, it is easy for us to perceive an irreconcilable antagon­
ism between these two positions. We are just as unlikely to be persu­
aded by Hegel's defence of hereditary monarchy, or his version of a
representative legislature. Even more fundamentally, the nation state
itself was probably never able to play the lofty role in human life which
Hegel assigned it.
Yet at a deeper level, Hegel's philosophy may not be dated at all. It
is not clear that we have in any way surpassed Hegel's conception of
modem human beings, their history, their needs and aspirations, and
the general social conditions required for their self-actualization.
Without denying the right of persons and subjects, Hegel asserts
against liberal orthodoxy the vital necessity for modem humanity of
concrete social situatedness and integration. He reminds us that
without this, the formal freedom to make arbitrary choices and
express our subjectivity leads in the direction of alienation rather than
self-actualization. He stresses the point that we cannot be free unless
our social life is self-transparent. We must be able to gain rational
insight into it, and live consciously in the light of this self-awareness.
Hegel remains an important social thinker largely because these
ideas, products of the age of German idealism, are still central to our
aspirations as reflective social beings. Hegel is also current because
these same aspirations are still radically unfulfilled. This can add only
urgency to Hegel's idea that the value of those freedoms liberals most
prize, though real and important, is nevertheless only conditional,
since it casts serious doubt on the eAtent to which the conditions are
really satisfied. Hegel meant the Philosophy oj Right to afford its
readers a joyous reconciliation with the social world around them. But
for us the actual effects of studying Hegel's book may be very dif­
ferent from what its author intended.

IO In the early twentieth century, this position was represented by
scholars such as Franz Rosenzweig and Hans Heimsoth (Franz
Rosenzweig, Hegel 111ld der Staat (1 920); Hans Heimsoth, Politik 111ld
Moral ill Hegels Gesclliclztsphilosophie (193 5) ). After the Second World
War, the 'centrist-reformist:' image of Hegel's political philosophy was
powerfully defended by three influential scholars: Joachim Ritter,
Eric Weil, and T. M. Knox. See Knox, 'Hegel and Prussianism'
(1935) (reprinted in Walter Kaufmann (ed.), Hegel's Political Philo­
sophy (New York: Atherton, 1 970)), and also the editorial material in
Knox's 1 942 translation of The Philosophy ojRight (Oxford University
Press, 1 967); Eric Weil, Hegel et I'itat (1950); and Joachim Ritter,
Hegel alld the Fretlch Revolt/tiotl (1 957), tr. R. D. Winfield (Cambridge,
MA: M I T Press, 1 982). A list of prominent Hegel scholars since the
1 950S who share the basic view of Knox, Weil, and Ritter would have
to include virtually every responsible scholar of Hegel's thought in the
past two generations. See especially: Shlomo Avineri, Hegel's TlleoT)' oj
the Modem State (Cambridge University Press, 1 972); Jacques
d'Hondt, Hegel ill His Tillie (1 973), translated by John Burbidge
(Le\viston, NY: Broadview, 1 988). Once again, for a reliable account
of the tradition which views Hegel as part of the 'mainstream of
Western political theory' see Ottmann, IlIdividt/1I1lI lwd Gesellscllaji,
pp. 224-378. A debate between proponents of the new consensus and
the older tradition of liberal criticism can be found in Walter Kauf­
mann (ed.), Hegel's Political Philosophy. The recent publication of
transcriptions of Hegel's lectures between 1 8 1 7 and 1 83 1 has further
confirmed such interpretations. See the editors' introductions to
these texts by Karl-Heinz Hting (VP R I, 25-126, V P R 1 7 17-34) and
Dieter Henrich (VP R I 9 9-39).

This particular triadic piece of jargon was actually used by both
Fichte and Schelling (each for his own purposes), but to my know­
ledge it was never used, not even once, by Hegel. We owe this way of
presenting the Hegelian dialectic to Heinrich Moritz Chalybaus, a
bowdlerizer of German idealist philosophy (see G. E. Mueller, 'The
Hegel Legend of "Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis" ', JOllnlal of the
HistoIJ' of Ideas 19 (1958), pp. 41 1-414. To use this jargon in
expounding Hegel is almost always an unwitting confession that the
expositor has little or no first-hand knowledge of Hegel.

Translator's preface
This translation is based on the text of the first edition of the Rechts­
(1 820), as reproduced in Volume VII of Hegel's Werke,
edited by Eva Moldenhauer and Karl Markus Michel and published
by the Suhrkamp Verlag (Frankfurt am Main, 1 970). I have compared
the text throughout with the variorum edition of the work in Volume II
of Karl-Heinz TIting's edition of Hegel's Vorlesungen iiber Rechts­
philosophie 1818-1831 (referred to as VP R II, see key to abbrevia­
tions, p. xlviii) , whose readings I have at times adopted in preference
to those of the Suhrkamp edition; in all such cases, and on those
occasions when I have encountered errors in the Suhrkamp text, I
have supplied explanatory footnotes.
To the main numbered paragraphs of his text, Hegel frequendy
adds elucidatory comments, often of considerable length, which he
describes as Anmerkungen a term which I have translated (both in
the singular and in the plural) as 'Remarks'. These Remarks are
indented throughout the translated text, as they are in the German
original, to distinguish them from the main text of the numbered
paragraphs to which they are appended. Many of these paragraphs are
further augmented by 'Additions' (Zusiitze) consisting of additional
material from lectures on the Rechtsphilosophie delivered by Hegel
after the first edition of the work had appeared. These Additions are
not indented, but printed in smaller type and prefixed in each case by
the word 'Addition' in order to distinguish them from Hegel's basic
text and Remarks. The Additions were not in fact compiled by Hegel,
but by his pupil Eduard Gans, who incorporated them in his own
edition of the Rechtsphilosophie, first published in 1 833 and reissued in

philosophie

-

Translator's preface
1 840; they have also been included in more recent editions such as
those of Bolland (1902) and Lasson (1 91 I), as well as that of the
Suhrkamp Verlag (1 970). Gans derived the Additions not from
manuscripts of Hegel himself, but from the lecture notes of two other
pupils, namely H. G. Hotho, who attended Hegel's lectures of 1 8221 823, and K. G. von Griesheim, who attended the lectures of 1 8241 825. They are included in this translation rather because of their
long traditional association with Hegel's text than because of any
claim they might have to scrupulous philological accuracy. They
should, in fact, be treated ·with caution, not so much because they are
based on the notes of students (which actually seem to be conscien­
tious and reasonably accurate in this case), but because Gans's
extracts are highly selective, combining material from two distinct
lecture series and consisting largely of paraphrase rather than ver­
batim quotation. The complete original texts of Hotho's and
Griesheim's notes have been available since 1 974 in Volumes III and

IV respectively of Hting's edition of the Vorleslmgetl iiber Reclzts­
plzilosoplzie (VPR), in which Hting helpfully encloses in curly brackets
those sections drawn upon by Gans for the Additions. To facilitate
comparison between Gans's versions and the original lecture notes as
published by Hting, I have identified the source of each Addition by
prefixing to it the letter H (Hotho; see V P R III), G (Griesheim; see

V P R IV), or both. I have checked Gans's Additions against their
sources throughout, and while I have made no attempt to indicate the
content of those large sections of Hotho's and Griesheim's notes
which Gans has simply ignored, or to record the numerous modifica­
tions of phrasing and terminology which he has himself introduced, I
have drawn attention in footnotes to those occasions on which he
appears to have misread or seriously misrepresented the text of
Hotho's and/or Griesheim's notes, or added comments of his own for
which there is no precedent in the sources.
Gans also had at his disposal Hegel's own manuscript annotations
to § § I-1 8o of the first edition of the

Reclztspltilosopltie.

These anno­

tations, which are reproduced in Hoffineister's (1 955) and Hting's
editions of the work and in that of the Suhrkamp Verlag, are not
included here, because they consist for the most part not of con­
tinuous prose but of highly condensed jottings whose value for an
understanding of the text is limited; besides, they are frequently
xxxvi

Translator's preface
cryptic, so that any translation of them would have to rely heavily on
conjecture.
In those sections of the text for which he was himself responsible,
Hegel uses two distinct means in order to indicate paragraph divi­
sions, and I have retained this distinction in my translation. Major
divisions - of which there are relatively few - are indicated by the
conventional device of starting a new line and indenting the beginning
of the new paragraph. Less important diVisions are marked only by a
dash before the beginning of the next sentence (or group of
sentences).
I have also attempted to reproduce, in the English translation,
Hegel's frequent use of italics for emphasis. These italics are an
important pointer not only to those terms or ideas on which Hegel
wished to lay particular stress, but even at times to his meaning (see,
for example, the first sentence of § 1 67, in which the italics make it
clear that the words in parenthesis refer only to the noun 'inward­
ness', and not to the noun 'truth' as well). Hegel's use of italics for
titles of books is likewise retained, although I have not followed his
(by no means consistent) practice, in which he was influ enced by
printing conventions of his day, of italicizing personal names and both
real and hypothetical quotations; in keeping with modern usage,
names are set in normal type and quotations are identified as such by
quotation-marks alone. Only on very rare occasions (for example, on
two occurrences of the word 'this' in the Addition to § 70) have I
introduced italics of my own to indicate necessary emphasis in
English.
A word must now be said concerning the principles underlying this
translation, and about the ways in which it differs from the well­
known version by T. M. Knox (Oxford, 1 942).
The Rechtsphilosophie is characterized by a high level of abstraction
and density of expression, and makes frequent use of technical terms
and phrases of uniquely Hegelian significance. I could not therefore
hope to attain that degree of readability and naturalness of English
expression at which I aimed in my translation of Hegel's

the Philosophy of World History (ImTodllction)

Lectllres on

(Cambridge, 1 975), for

the latter work is for the most part considerably less abstract and
technical in character than the Reclztsplzilosophie. But I have attempted,
as in the previous translation, to achieve a high degree of literalness,
xxxvii

Translator's preface
especially in conveying the conceptual basis of Hegel's thought; on
the present occasion, however, I have been more conscious of the
need to maintain consistency in translating technical terms and words
which Hegel uses particularly frequently, or which have a particular
significance within his thought. To cite two examples, I translate
terms such as

an und for sich ('in and for itself) literally throughout,
Bestimmung as 'determination'

and render Hegel's much-used term

wherever possible, supplying the original in brackets in cases where
sense and usage call for alternative renderings. I considered it less
essential, on the other hand, to try to reproduce Hegel's sentence
structure exactly where this would have made for unduly cumbersome
or unidiomatic English.
The term

Recht, which occurs in the title of Hegel's work and on

numerous occasions throughout the text, also calls for comment. Its
range of meaning, which is closely akin to that of the Latin term ius, is
much wider than that of the English word 'right', for it encompasses
not only the rights of specific individuals and groups of people, but
also the entire realm oflaw and justice, both as philosophical concepts
(cf. Naturrecht, English 'natural law') and actual institutions (cf. riimis­
ches Recht, English 'Roman law'). For the sake of consistency, I have
translated it as 'right' whenever possible, and on those (relatively
infrequent) occasions when I have had to translate the word Recht - as
distinct from its compounds - as 'law' or 'justice', I have added the
original in square brackets.
T. M. Knox's translation has been of considerable assistance to
me. On many occasions, I found myself indebted to his solutions to
daunting problems which confront the reader and translator of
Hegel's text. Where Knox's renderings seemed incapable of signifi­
cant improvement - as was not infrequently the case - I made no
attempt to look for alternatives simply for the sake of being different.
On the other hand, Knox's language is often excessively formal by
today's standards, and even at times archaic (which is scarcely sur­
prising after almost half a century); in such cases, I have tried to adopt
a less stilted idiom.
The main difference between my translation and Knox's, however,

is that his general strategy is almost the reverse of my own as des­
cribed at the top of this page. Knox declares in his preface (pp. xi-xii)

that he has aimed at a literal translation. This literalness is more
conspicuous, however, in his attempts to reproduce Hegel's sen-

xxxviii

Translator's preface
tence-structure and turns of phrase, even at the expense of English
idiom, than in his treatment of Hegel's network of concepts. He tends
to paraphrase technical expressions (for example, by rendering an lmd
fiir sich as 'absolute(ly)'), and to translate the same conceptual term in
numerous different ways according to context (for example, by
employing over twenty-five different translations for the term Bestim­
mung - admittedly an extreme and problematic case); and in particu­
larly abstract passages, he tends to abandon even his customary
adherence to Hegel's sentence-structure in favour of free paraphrase
(comparison of our respective renderings of § 183, for example, or of
the first sentence of § 1 73 should make the latter difference
apparent). In view of these differences of approach, Knox's render­
ings have on many occasions struck me as too loose or imprecise, and
I have duly endeavoured to improve on them. But I must again
acknowledge with gratitude that Knox's general understanding of
Hegel's German is of a high order, with the result that the number of
outright errors I have been able to identify in his translation (around
seventy-five) is remarkably small for a work as long and complex as
the Rechtsphilosophie.
Some of Knox's solutions to problems posed by Hegel's technical
terminology are now so well established in English-speaking Hegel
scholarship that I have simply taken them over, as I did in my previous
translation. These include his translations of real and wirkliclz as 'real'
and 'actual', and of moralisclz and sittliclz as 'moral' and 'ethical'. (The
latter translation, incidentally, is sanctioned by a manuscript gloss of
Hegel's on the expression ethisclze Pflichtenlehre ('ethical theory of
duties') in § 1 48: the gloss reads 'Ethisclz - statt moralisch - sittlich' (i.e.
'not mdral, but ethical or sittlich') see VPR II, 55 7.)
The pairs of words just cited are, however, only two instances of a
phenomenon which occurs with bewildering frequency in Hegel's
writings and which confronts the translator with formidable diffi­
culties - namely his tendency to employ pairs, or even triads, of terms
which were virtually synonymous in the German of his day and to
invest them at times - but by no means invariably - with nuances of
difference or even with contrasting meanings; some of these dif­
ferences of meaning will indeed be apparent only to those who are
familiar with the connotations of the terms in question in other parts
of Hegel's philosophical system. Examples of such couplings (in addi­
tion to the two already mentioned) include Dasein and Existenz, Ding
-

xxxix

Translator's prefoce
and

Sache, Objekt and Gegenstand, Bezielllmg and Relation (also
Verhiiltnis), Grenze and Sdlratlke, Gejiilzl and Empfindtmg, and Nation
and Volk. It is sometimes possible to find equivalent (if at times
somewhat arbitrarily chosen) pairs of words in English, such as
'reference' and 'relation' for
and 'limit' for

Bezielllmg and Verhiiltnis, or 'boundary'
Grenze and Sdlratlke. But on many occasions, the only

natural translation for both German words will be the same English
word, as with 'existence' for both Dasein (very awkwardly rendered by
some earlier translators as 'determinate being') and
for Ding and

SadIe,

and 'object' for

E:dstetIZ, 'thing'
Objekt and Gegenstatld. My solu­

tion in such cases has usually been to employ the same English word
for both, adding the German originals in square brackets; the wider
associations and range of meaning of such terms, as used by Hegel,
can then be followed up in the glossary at the end of the volume.
When both of the words in such a coupling occur with great
frequency, I have supplied the originals of both (as with

ExistetlZ, Ding and Sache).

Dasein

and

But where one of the two is used with

greater frequency, or adheres consistently to a shared meaning from
which its partner at times deviates, I have supplied the original only of
the less frequent or more variable term, as with the adjectives besonder
(frequently used) and partikular (less frequently used) for 'particular',
and the nouns

Objekt

(consistent meaning) and

Gegenstatld

(more

variable meaning) for 'object'. This arrangement has the advantage of
reducing the number of German interpolations needed in the text. To
the same end, I have normally supplied such words, where they are
required, only on their first occurrence within each of Hegel's num­
bered paragraphs (including any subsequent Remarks or Addition),
except where the interval between successive occurrences is so long
as to justifY a repetition; later occurrences of the relevant English
term within the same paragraph and its appendages can normally be
assumed to translate the German term already supplied on the
previous occasion. When the near-synonym of the German term in
question also occurs within a given paragraph and its appendages, I
have continued to supply the German originals of both in all instances
where the two might otherwise be confused. In a few cases where I
have been unable to detect any semantic difference between such
terms - as with the pairings Gnmdsatz and Prinzip ('principle') or
Jurist and Rechtsgelehrter ('jurist'), for example, and on some occasions
with Berechtigmlg and Redltftrtigmlg ('justification') - I have used the

xl

Translator's prefizce
same English word for both without supplying the original of either.
But in all cases where significant distinctions might otherwise be
missed, or where conceptually significant German terms are
translated in an unconventional or anomalous manner, I have added
the original in brackets. The obvious disadvantage of interrupting the
English text with parentheses of this kind is, to my mind, outweighed
by the greater precision and insight into Hegel's usage which this
procedure makes possible.

All of the German terms so far mentioned are to be found, \vith

their English translations, in the glossary. In this glossary, those
English renderings which, in the text, are normally accompanied by
the German original are identified by an asterisk, and cross­
references to their synonyms, near synonyms, and apparent synonyms
are also supplied. The glossary makes no claim to comprehensive­
ness; it includes only key terms, and in particular those which present
difficulties of translation. Its chief purpose, apart from listing the
standard translations employed, is to elucidate, by means of cross­
references to related terms and by including most secondary as well as
primary English renderings of the German words listed, those clus­
ters of concepts which are of vital importance to an understanding of
Hegel's thought. It is, of course, impossible to apply a list of standard
English equivalents mechanically in translating a work as complex as
the

Rechtsphilosophie,

or to use the glossary in reverse as a key to the

German originals of every English term listed in it. Two examples
may illustrate the difficulties involved. First, two or more completely
different German words, which are in no way synonyms, may have to

be translated by the same English term which happens to have two or
more distinct meanings. Thus, the words
certain contexts), and

U1ltertan,

Subjekt, Gegenstand

(in

may all be translated as 'subject', as

applied respectively to mind as distinct from its object, to the topic of
a treatise or discourse, and to one who owes allegiance to a sovereign

or state. But in the absence of full dictionary-style definitions of each
distinct usage - and such definitions are beyond the scope of a
glossary of translations - only the context \vithin the work itself can
make the different senses intelligible. And secondly, in cases where
literal translation is impossible - as with many of Hegel's adjectival
nouns, whose English translation requires a noun to be added to the
adjective in question (for example, in the second sentence of § 1 70,
where

ein Gemeinsames

is translated 'a common purpose', or in the

xli

Translator's prefoce
third sentence of § I 1 8, where

ganz afzderes

is translated as 'things

quite different') - words may be generated ('purpose' and 'things' in
the examples just cited) for which no precise equivalent is present in
the original. In those (relatively few) instances of this kind where
confusion or serious ambiguity seemed likely to result, I have supplied
the original German in brackets. It must, however, be emphasized
that, in any systematic study of Hegel's linguistic usage, there is no
substitute for consulting the original text.
Another class of terms which present the translator with difficulties
are those which Hegel on some occasions invests with a sense
peculiar to his own system, but on other occasions continues to use in
one or more of the senses which they possess in everyday usage. The
most familiar of these is perhaps the verb

aufheben,

which I have

normally translated as 'to supersede' when it is used in its technical
sense (which itself encompasses the meanings 'to remove (or cancel)',
'to raise', and 'to preserve'); when translating it in other ways (for
example, as 'to overcome'), I have added the original in brackets.
Similarly,

Vorstelltmg

often denotes that mode of 'representational

thought' or 'representational thinking' which, for Hegel, deals not in
concepts but in images raised to the form of universality; but on other
occasions, it signifies no more than a 'notion' or 'idea' in the everyday
senses of these words. The range of this particular term - like the
term Besti71l11ltmg - is exceptionally wide and variable in Hegel's writ­
ings, and I have supplied the original in brackets on those occasions
where translations other than 'representational thought' or 'represen­
tational thinking' are required. Hegel's use of the term /dee, however,
is more consistent. He uses it almost invariably in its technical sense,
to denote the full development (or 'truth') of the Begriff or concept.
To indicate this special significance, I have translated it throughout
with a capital, as 'Idea'.
Certain other terms cause difficulties because the institutions to
which they refer do not have precise counterparts in present-day
society, or because the German term in question has no precise
equivalent in English. Thus, Hegel's

Polizei has a much wider sense

than the English 'police', since it refers to an authority whose
responsibility extends beyond the upholding of law and order to such
matters as price control, public works, and welfare provisions; for this
reason, Knox and others have translated it as 'public authority'. To
this I would object that Hegel's

Polizei

xlii

is just as alien to modem

Translator's prefoce
German-speakers as the translation 'police' is to modem English­
speakers, because the word

Polizei in modem

German has much the

same range of meaning as 'police' has in modem English. I have
accordingly used the translation 'police' throughout. The term Stiinde
poses two distinct problems, first because the institutions to which it
refers have changed in character since Hegel's day, and secondly
because it has not just one but two (albeit closely related) meanings.
The Stiillde were, in the first place, the Estates (or Etats) of feudal and
absolutist society, whose representatives might constitute a formal
assembly or parliament. The identity of these Estates was grounded in
supposedly natural divisions within society (such as nobility, clergy,
and commoners), and the term could accordingly be used in a wider
sense (as the singular

Stand regularly was)

to denote other naturally

distinct social groups such as the practitioners of different trades or
professions. In the former, predominantly political sense, I have
translated

Stiinde as 'Estates' (with a capital). And in the latter, wider

sense, I have translated it as 'estates' (with a small letter), in order to
distinguish it from Hegel's term

Klasse,

which I have in tum

translated as 'class' and which corresponds more closely to the
modem concept of class as a socio-economic category. The term

Wissenschaji,

in Hegel's day as in the present, has no precise

equivalent in English, the nearest approximation being the term
'science', which I have accordingly used to translate it.

Wissenschaji in

German denotes any branch of knowledge or scholarly activity which
is pursued and cultivated in a systematic manner, and in Hegel's case,
it is associated in particular with philosophy as he himself understood
it. The English term 'science', on the other hand, at least since the
first half of the nineteenth century, has carried a more circumscribed
meaning, being associated first and foremost with the explanation of
natural phenomena.
Even the commonest of German verbs, the verb

sein

('to be'), can

cause considerable problems, chiefly because Hegel often uses it in
an absolute sense (i.e. without a predicate). Such usage (as in 'To be,
or not to be') is rare in English, so that literal translation is not always
possible. Where

sei1z in the absolute sense is coupled with an sich {'in

itself), flir sich ('for itself), etc., I have translated it as 'to have being'
(for example, 'to have being in and for itself for Hegel's

sidz sein). Where it means

an 1111d flir

'to exist', I have at times rendered it as 'to

be present' in order to avoid confusion with 'to exist' as a translation

xliii

Translator's preface
of Hegel's existieren, although 'to exist' is sometimes feasible where no
confusion with existieren is possible.
A word must be said in conclusion on the issue of gender-specific
language. By present-day standards, Hegel's views on women, like
those of many of his contemporaries, are highly discriminatory and
even offensive (see, for example, § 1 66 of the Reclltsphilosophie).
Accordingly, he regularly uses masculine pronouns, adjectival forms,
etc. either to include the feminine, or to exclude it altogether because
he considers the female sex irrelevant to whatever political or social
institution he is discussing. In the interests of accuracy, I have
wherever possible translated such forms literally. I have, however, in
most cases translated the word Mensch as 'human being', although in a
minority of contexts where this would have sounded unduly awkward
or necessitated a misleading use of the plural, I have translated it as
'man' or 'mankind' (see, for example, § 1 8 and the Addition to § 1 39).
Square brackets are used throughout to indicate material inter­
polated by the editor or translator. Such material includes both orig­
inal German terms where these are supplied, and words or phrases
which I have added for ease of reading or comprehension, but which
have no equivalents in the original. Works frequently cited in the
footnotes are referred to by short title or abbreviation, followed
(where applicable) by volume-number in Roman numerals and page­
number: e.g. V P R III, 100; Werke, VII, 200.
Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to Professor Allen Wood for
his scrutiny of my translation and for many helpful suggestions, and to
Mrs Ema Smith for fitting into an already busy schedule the time­
consuming task of typing the manuscript.

Preface
The immediate occasion for me to publish this outline is the need to
provide my audience \vith an introduction to the lectures on the
Philosophy ojRight which I deliver in the course of my official duties. J
This textbook is a more extensive, and in particular a more systematic,
exposition of the same basic concepts which, in relation to this part of
philosophy, are already contained in a previous work designed to
accompany my lectures, namely my Ellcyclopaedia oj the Philosophical
Sciences (Heidelberg, 1 8 1 7).2
The fact that this outline was due to appear in print and thus to
come before a wider public gave me the opportunity to amplifY in it
some of those Remarks whose primary purpose was to comment
briefly on ideas [Vorstelltmgell] akin to or divergent from my own, on
further consequences of my argument, and on other such matters as
would be properly elucidated in the lectures themselves. I have ampli­
fied them here so as to clarifY on occasion the more abstract contents
of the text and to take fuller account of related ideas [Vorstellzmgen]
which are current at the present time. As a result, some of these
Remarks have become more extensive than the aim and style of a
compendium would normally lead one to el!.'Pect. A genuine com­
pendium, however, has as its subject-matter what is considered to be
the entire compass of a science; and what distinguishes it - apart,
perhaps, from a minor addition here or there - is above all the way in
which it arranges and orders .the essential elements [Momente] of a
content which has long been familiar and accepted, just as the form in
which it is presented has its rules and conventions which have long
been agreed. But a philosophical outline is not expected to conform to

9

Philosophy ojRight
this pattern, if only because it is imagined that what philosophy puts
forward is as ephemeral a product as Penelope's weaving, which is
begun afresh every day.3
It is certainly true that the primary difference between the present
outline and an ordinary compendium is the method which constitutes
its guiding principle. But I am here presupposing that the philosophi­
cal manner of progressing from one topic to another and of conduct­
ing a scientific proof - this entire speculative mode of cognition - is
essentially different from other modes of cognition.4 The realization
that such a difference is a necessary one is the only thing which can
save philosophy from the shameful decline into which it has fallen in
our times. It has indeed been recognized that the forms and rules of
the older logic - of definition, classification, and inference - which
include the rules of the understanding's cognition [Ver­

standeserkenntnis],

are inadequate for speculative science. Or rather,

their inadequacy has not so much been recognized as merely felt, and
then the rules in question have been cast aside, as if they were simply
fetters, to make way for the arbitrary pronouncements of the heart, of
fantasy, and of contingent intuition; and since, in spite of this, reflec­
tion and relations of thought inevitably also come into play, the
despised method of commonplace deduction and ratiocination is
unconsciously adopted. - Since I have fully developed the nature of
speculative knowledge in my Science ofLogic,5 I have only occasionally
added an explanatory comment on procedure and method in the
present outline. Given that the subject-matter is concrete and
inherently of so varied a nature, I have of course omitted to
demonstrate and bring out the logical progression in each and every
detail. But on the one hand, it might have been considered super­
fluous to do so in view of the fact that I have presupposed a familiarity
with scientific method; and on the other, it will readily be noticed that
the work as a whole, like the construction

[Ausbi/dullg]

of its parts, is

based on the logical spirit. It is also chiefly from this point of view that
I would wish this treatise to be understood and judged. For what it
deals with is

science, and in science, the content is essentially insepar­

able from the flrol.
It is true that we may hear it said by those who seem to adopt the
most thorough approach that form is a purely external quality, indif­
ferent to the matter

[Sac/ie]

itself, which is alone of consequence;

furthermore, the task of the writer, especially the philosophical writer,
10

Preface
may be said to consist in the discovery of tmths, the statement of
tmths, and the dissemination of tmths and correct concepts.6 But if we
consider how this task is actually performed, we see on the one hand
how the same old brew is reheated again and again and served up to

all and sundry - a task that may not be without its merits in educating

and arousing the emotions, though it might sooner be regarded as the
superfluous product of over-zealous activity - 'for they have Moses
and the prophets; let them hear them'.7 Above all, we have ample
opportunity to wonder at the tone and pretentiousness that can be
detected in such writers, as if all that the world had hitherto lacked
was these zealous disseminators of truths, and as if their reheated
brew contained new and unheard-of truths which ought, as they
always claim, to be taken particularly to heart, above all 'at the present
time'. But on the other hand, we can see how whatever truths of this
kind are handed out by one party are displaced and swept away by
truths of precisely the same kind dispensed by other parties. And if,
amidst this jumble of truths, there is something that is neither old nor
new but enduring, how can it be extracted from these formlessly
fluctuating reflections - how can it be distinguished and verified other

scientific means?
tmth concerning right, ethics, alld the state is at any rate as old as
its expositioll alld promulgatioll in public laws alld in public morality alld
religioll. What more does this truth require, inasmuch as the thinking
mind [Geist] is not content to possess it in this proximate manner?
What it needs is to be comprehended as well, so that the content which
than by
The

is already rational in itself may also gain a rational form and thereby
appear justified to free thinking. For such thinking does not stop at

what is given, whether the latter is supported by the external positive

authority of the state or of mutual agreement among human beings, or
by the authority of inner feeling and the heart and by the testimony of
the spirit which immediately concurs with this, but starts out from
itself and thereby demands to know itself as united in its innermost
being with the truth.
The simple reaction

[Verhalten]

of ingenuous emotion is to adhere

with trusting conviction to the publicly recognized truth and to base
one's conduct and fixed position in life on this firm foundation. But
this simple reaction may well encounter the supposed difficulty of
how to distinguish and discover, among the

illfillite variety ojopilliolls,

what is universally acknowledged and valid in them; and this perplexII

Philosophy ofRight
ity may easily be taken for a just and genuine concern with the matter

[Sachrj itself. But in fact, those who pride themselves on this perplex­
ity are in the position of not being able to see the wood for the trees,
and the only perplexity and difficulty that is present is the one they
have themselves created ; indeed, this perplexity and difficulty is
rather a proof that they want something other than what is universally
acknowledged and valid, something other than the substance of the
right and the ethical. For if they were genuinely concerned with the
latter and not with the

vanity and particularity of opinions and being,

they would adhere to the substantial right, namely to the command­
ments of ethics and of the state, and regulate their lives accordingly. A further difficulty arises, however, from the fact that human beings

think and look for their freedom and the basis of ethics in [the realm
of] thought. But however exalted, however divine this right may be, it
is nevertheless transformed into wrong if the only criterion of thought
and the only way in which thought can know itself to be free is the
extent to which it

valid and

diverges from what is universally acknowledged and

manages to invent something particular for itself.

The notion

[Vorstelltmg]

that freedom of thought, and of spirit in

general, can be demonstrated only by divergence from, and even
hostility towards, what is publicly acknowledged might seem to be
most firmly rooted nowadays in

relation [Beziell1mg] to the state; for this

very reason, it might seem to be the essential task of a philosophy of
the state to invent and propound yet

another theory, and specifically a
[VorstellU11g] and

new and particular theory. If we examine this notion

the activity that is associated with it, we might well imagine that no
state or constitution had ever previously existed or were in existence
today, but that we had

now (and this 'now' is of indefinite duration) to

start right from the beginning, and that the ethical world had been
waiting only for such intellectual constructions, discoveries, and

now available. As far as nature is concerned, it is readily
as it is, that the philo­
sopher's stone lies hidden somewhere, but withitl Ilature itself, that
nature is rational within itself, and that it is this actual reason present

proofs as are

admitted that philosophy must recognize it

within it which knowledge must investigate and grasp conceptually not the shapes and contingencies which are visible on the surface, but
nature's eternal harmony, conceived, however, as the law and essence

immane1lt within it. The ethical world, on the other hand, the state, or
reason as it actualizes itself in the element of self-consciousness, is
12

not supposed to be happy in the knowledge that it is reason itself
which has in fact gained power and authority

[Gewalt] within this ele­

ment, and which asserts itself there and remains inherent within it.'"

"Additioll (H). There are two kinds of laws, laws of nature and laws of
right: the laws of nature are simply there and are valid as they stand: they
suffer no diminution, although they may be infringed in individual cases.
To know what the law of nature is, we must familiarize ourselves with
nature, for these laws are correct and it is only our notions [Vorstel!tI1lgell]
concerning them which may be false. The measure of these laws is
external to us, and our cognition adds nothing to them and does not
advance them: it is only our cognition of them which can expand. Know­
ledge [Kell1lt1lis] of right is in one respect similar to this and in another
respect different. We get to know the laws of right in just the same way,
simply as they are; the citizen knows them more or less in this way, and
the positive jurist also stops short at what is given. But the difference is
that, with the laws of right, the spirit of reflectiona comes into play and
their very diversity draws attention to the fact that they are not absolute.
The laws of right are something laid dowlI/ something derivedfrom human
beings. It necessarily follows that our inner voice may either come into
collision with them or concur with them. The human being does not stop
short at the existent [dem Daseielldell], but claims to have within himself
the measure of what is right; he may be subjected to the necessity and
power of external authority, but never in the same way as to natural
necessity, for his inner self always tells him how things ought to be, and he
finds within himself the confirmation or repudiation of what is accepted
as valid. In nature, the highest truth is that a law exists at all; in laws of
right, however, the thing [Sac/Ie] is not valid because it exists; on the
contrary, everyone demands that it should match his own criterion. Thus
a conflict may arise between what is and what ought to be, between the
right which has being in and for itself, which remains unaltered, and the
arbitrary determination of what is supposed to be accepted as right. A
disjunction and conflict of this kind is found only in the sphere [Bodell] of
the spirit, and since the prerogative of the spirit thus seems to lead to
discord and unhappiness, we often tum away from the arbitrariness oflife
to the contemplation of nature and are inclined to take the latter as a
model. But these very discrepancies [Gegellsiitze] between that right which
has being in and for itself and what arbitrariness proclaims as right make
it imperative for us to learn to recognize precisely what right is. In right,

tion, simply read Geist ('spirit'): see VP R Ill, 93.

word Gmt:; (law) and Geset:;tes (something laid down or posited).
13

Philosophy ofRight
The spiritual universe is supposed rather to be at the mercy of
contingency and arbitrariness, to be god-forsakell, so that, according to
this atheism of the ethical world,

tntth lies outside it, and at the same
also supposed to be present in it,

time, since reason is nevertheless

truth is nothing but a problem. But, we are told, this very circum­
stance justifies, indeed obliges, every thinker to take his own initiative,
though not in search

ofthe philosopher's stone, for this search is made

superfluous by the philosophizing of our times and everyone,
whatever his condition, can be assured that he has this stone in his
grasp. Now it does admittedly happen that those who live within the
actuality of the state and are able to satisfY their knowledge and
volition within it - and there are many of them, more in fact than

basically this includes everyone - or at least those
consciously find satisfaction within the state, laugh at such initiat­

think or know it, for
who

ives and assurances and regard them as an empty game, now more
amusing, now more serious, now pleasing, now dangerous. This rest­
less activity of vain reflection, along with the reception and response it

the human being must encounter his own reason; he must therefore
consider the rationality of right, and this is the business of our science, in
contrast with positive jurisprudence, which is often concerned only with
contradictions. Besides, the present-day world has a more urgent need of
such an investigation, for in olden times there was still respect and
veneration for the existing [bestehenden] law, whereas the culture [Bildlll/g]
of the present age has taken a new direction, and thought has adopted a
leading role in the formation of values. Theories are put forward in
opposition to what already exists [dem Daseienden], theories which seek to
appear correct and necessary in and for themselves. From now on, there
is a more special need to recognize and comprehend the thoughts of right.
Since thought has set itself up as the essential form, we must attempt to
grasp right, too, in terms of thought. If thought is to take precedence over
right, this would seem to throw open the door to contingent opinions; but
genuine thought is not an opinion about something [die Sadie], but the
concept of the thing [Sadie] itself. The concept of the thing does not
come to us by nature. Everyone has fingers and can take a brush and
paint, but that does not make him a painter. It is precisely the same \vith
thinking. The thought of right is not, for example, what everybody knows
at first hand; on the contrary, correct thinking is knmving [das Kellllen]
and recognizing the thing, and our cognition should therefore be
scientific.
14

Preface
encounters, might be regarded as a separate issue [SadIe], developing
independently in its own distinct way, were it not that philosophy in
general has incurred all kinds of contempt and discredit as a result of
such behaviour. The worst kind of contempt it has met with is, as
already mentioned, that everyone, whatever his condition, is con­
vinced that he knows all about philosophy in general and can pass
judgement upon it. No other art or science is treated with this
ultimate degree of contempt, namely the assumption that one can take
possession of it outright.
In fact, what we have seen the philosophy of recent times proclaim­
ing with the utmost pretension in relation to the state has no doubt
entitled anyone who wishes to have a say in such matters to the belief
that he could just as well do the same thing on his own account, and
thereby prove to himself that he was in possession of philosophy. In
any case, this self-styled philosophy has expressly stated that truth
itselfcamlOt be ktlOW11 [erkannt], but that truth consists in what wells up
from each individual's heart, emotion, and enthusiasm in relation to ethi­
cal subjects, particularly in relation to the state, government, and
constitution. What has not been said in this connection to flatter the
young in particular?8 And the young have certainly taken note of it.
The saying 'for he giveth to his own in sleep' has been applied to
science, so that all sleepers have counted themselves among the
chosen; but the concepts they have acquired in their sleep have of
course borne the marks of their origin.9 - A leader of this superficial
brigade of so-called philosophers, Herr Fries,t had the temerity, at a
solemn public occasion which has since become notorious,!} to put
forward the following idea [Vorstellung] in an address on the subject of
the state and constitution: 'In a people among whom a genuine
communal spirit prevails, all business relating to public affairs would
gain its lift from below, from the people itself; living societies, steadfastly
united by the sacred bOtld offriendship, would dedicate themselves to
every single project of popular education and popular service'; and so
on. - The chief tendency of this superficial philosophy is to base
science not on the development of thought and the concept, but on
immediate perception and contingent imagination; and likewise, to
reduce the complex inner articulation of the ethical, i.e. the state, the
architectonics of its rationality - which, through determinate distinctHegel's llOle: I have testified elsewhere to the superficiality of his science: see my Science

tions between the various spheres of public life and the rights [Berech ­

tigU1Zge11]

they are based on, and through the strict proportions in

which every pillar, arch, and buttress is held together, produces the
strength of the whole from the harmony of its parts - to reduce this
refined

[gebildeten]

structure to a mush of 'heart, friendship, and

enthusiasm'.'2 According to this notion

[Vorstellung],

the ethical

world, like the universe of Epicurus, should be given over to the
subjective contingency of opinions and arbitrariness; but of course
this is not the case.13 By the simple household remedy of attributing to
jeeli1zg what reason and its understandirig have laboured to produce
over several thousand years, all the trouble involved in rational insight
and cognition, guided by the thinking concept, can of course be
avoided. Goethe's Mephistopheles - a good authority - says much the
same thing in lines which I have also quoted elsewhere:
Do but despise reason and science,
The highest of all human gifts Then you have surrendered to the devil
And must surely perish. /4
The next step is for this view to assume the guise of piety as well; for
what lengths has such behaviour not gone to in order to lend itself
authority! By means of godliness and the Bible, however, it has
presumed to gain the supreme justification for despising the ethical
order and the objectivity of the laws. For it is surely also piety which
envelops in the simpler intuition of feeling that truth which, in the
world itself, is diversified into an organic realm. But if it is the right
kind of piety, it abandons the form of this [emotional] region as soon
as it emerges from [the condition of] inwardness into the daylight of

the Idea's full development

[Entfolttmg] and manifest abundance, and

it brings \vith it, from its inner worship of God, a reverence for the
laws and for a truth which has being in and for itself and is exalted
above the subjective form of feeling.
The particular form of bad conscience which betrays itself in the
vainglorious

eloquence

of this

superficial

philosophy may be

remarked on here; for in the first place, it is precisely where it is at its­

most spiritless that it has most to say about spirit, where its talk is driest
and most lifeless that it is freest with the words 'life' and 'enliven', and

where it shows the utmost selfishness of empty arrogance that it most
often refers to the 'people'. But the distinctive mark which it carries
I6

I

L

Preface
on its brow is its hatred of law. That right and ethics, and the actual
world of right and the ethical, are grasped by means of thoughts and
give themselves the form of rationality - namely universality and
determinacy - by means of thoughts, is what constitutes

the law; and it

is this which is justifiably regarded as the main enemy by that feeling
which reserves the right to do as it pleases, by that conscience which
identifies right with subjective conviction. The form of right as a
and a

law is felt by it to be a dead, cold letter and a shackle;

duty

for it does

not recognize itself in the law and thereby recognize its own freedom
in it, because the law is the reason of the thing

[Sache]

and reason

does not allow feeling to warm itself in the glow of its own particu­
larity

[Partikularitiit].

The

law

is therefore, as I have remarked

elsewhere in the course of this textbook, IS the chief shibboleth by

which the false brethren and friends of the so-called 'people' give
themselves away.

Since this arbitrary sophistry has usurped the name of philosophy
and persuaded a wide public that such activities are philosophy, it has
almost become dishonourable to continue to speak philosophically
about the nature of the state; and right-minded

[reelltfiche]

men can­

not be blamed if they grow impatient as soon as they hear talk of a
philosophical science of the state. There is even less cause for sur­
prise that governments have at last directed their attention to such
philosophizing, for philosophy with us is not in any case practised as a
private art, as it was with the Greeks, for example, but has a public
existence

[Existenz], impinging upon the public,

especially - or solely

- in the service of the state. Governments have had enough con­
fidence in those of their scholars who have devoted themselves to this
subject to leave the development

[Ausbildlwg]

and import of philo­

sophy entirely to them - granted that here and there, they may have
done so not so much out of confidence in science as out of indif­
ference towards it, retaining teaching posts in philosophy only for
reasons of tradition Gust as in France, to the best of my knowledge,
chairs of metaphysics at least have been allowed to lapse). But their
confidence has frequendy been ill repaid, or alternatively, if they are
thought to be motivated by indifference, the resultant decay of
thorough knowledge

[Erkentzt1Iis]

should be regarded as the penalty

for this indifference. It may initially appear that this superficial philo­
sophy is eminendy compatible at least ,vith outward peace and order,
in that it never manages to touch the substance of things
17

[Sachen], or

Philosophy ofRight
even to suspect its existence; it would thus have no cause to fear
police intervention, at least initially, if it were not that the state also
contained the need for a deeper education and insight, and demanded
that this need be satisfied by science. But superficial philosophy leads
automatically, as far as the ethical [world] and right and duty in
general are concerned, to those principles which constitute super­
ficiality in this sphere, namely the principles of the Sophists as we find
them so clearly described by Plato.J6 These principles identifY what is
right with subjective ends and opinions, with subjectivefeeling and particu­
lar [partikuliire] conviction, and they lead to the destruction of inner
ethics and the upright conscience, of love and right among private
persons, as well as the destruction of public order and the laws of the
state. The significance which such phenomena

[Erschei1llmgen]

must

acquire for governments can scarcely be reduced, for example, by the
claim that the very confidence shown by the state and the authority of
an official position are enough to warrant the demand that the state
should accept and give free rein to what corrupts the substantial
source of all deeds, namely universal principles, and should even
allow itself to be defied, as if such defiance were entirely proper. 'If
God gives someone an office, he also gives him sense

[Verstand]'/i is

an old chestnut which will scarcely be taken seriously by anyone
nowadays.
In the importance which circumstances have again led governments
to attach to the way in which philosophers conduct their business,
there is no mistaking the fact that the study of philosophy now seems
in many other respects to require an element

[Mome1lf]

of protection

and encouragement. For in so many publications in the field of
the positive sciences, as well as in works of religious edification and
other indeterminate literature, the reader encounters not only that
contempt for philosophy which I have already referred to, in that
the very people who reveal that their intellectual development

[Gedatzkenbildll1lg]

is extremely retarded and that philosophy is com­

pletely alien to them also treat it as something they have finished and
done with; beyond this, we also find that such writers expressly

God and of physical and spiritual nature, the cognition oJtmth, to be a
foolish, indeed sinful presumption, and that reason, and again reaS01l,
and in endless repetition reason is arraigned, belittled, and con­

impugn philosophy and declare its content, the

demned. Or at the very least, they let us see how, for a large propor-

18

Preface
tion of those engaged in supposedly scientific study, the claims of the
concept constitute an embarrassment from which they are neverthe­
less unable to escape. If, I say, one is confronted with such
phenomena [Erscheimmget/], one might almost begin to suspect that
tradition is from this poillf oJ view no longer worthy of respect nor
sufficient to guarantee tolerance and a continued public existence
[Existet/z] to the study of philosophy.ti8 - The declamations and
presumptuous outbursts against philosophy which are so common in
our time afford the peculiar spectacle on the one hand of being in the
right, by virtue of that superficiality to which philosophical science has
been degraded, and on the other of themselves being rooted in the
very element against which they so ungratefully turn. For by declaring
the cognition of truth to be a futile endeavour, this self-styled
philosophizing has reduced all thoughts and all topics to the same level,
just as the depotism of the Roman emperors ret/loved all distinaions
between patricians and slaves, virtue and vice, honour and dishonour,
and knowledge [Ket/ntnis] and ignorance.2o As a result, the concepts
of truth and the laws of ethics are reduced to mere opinions and
subjective convictions, and the most criminal principles - since they,
too, are conviaio1lS are accorded the same status as those laws; and in
the same way, all objects, however barren and particular [partikular],
and all materials, however arid, are accorded the same status as what
constitutes the interest of all thinking people and the bonds of the
ethical world.
-

It should therefore be considered a stroke ofgoodfortune for science
- although in fact, as I have already mentioned,2i it is a necessary
consequet/ce of the thing [Sache] itself - that this philosophizing, which
could well have continued to spin itself into its own web of scholastic
wisdom, has come into closer contact with actuality, in which the
principles of rights and duties are a serious matter, and which lives in
tHegel's nole: I was reminded of such views on reading a letter ofJohannes von Muller
(Werke [Tubingen, 1 8 1 0-19], Part VIII, p. 56), where he says of the condition ofRome in
1803 when the city was under French rule: 'Asked how the public educational institu­
tions were faring, a professor replied: "On les tolere comme les bordels." " 19 One can
still even hear people recommenditlg so-called 'rational theory' [Vernunfilehre], i.e. logic,
'

perhaps in the belief that no one in any case bothers about it any longer as a dry and
unfruitful science, or that, if this does happen now and again, those who study it will find
only vacuous formulae, neither beneficial nor detrimental, so that the recommendation
cannot possibly do any harm, even if it does no good either.

the light of its consciousness of these principles, and that a public split

has consequently resulted between the two. It is

this vet)' relation of
philosophy to actuality which is the subject of misunderstandings, and I
accordingly come back to my earlier observation that, since philo­

sophy is

exploration ofthe rational, it is for that very reason the compre­
hetlsion ofthe presetlt and the actual, not the setting up of a world beyond

which exists God knows where - or rather, of which we can very well

say that we know where it exists, namely in the errors of a one-sided
and empty ratiocination. In the course of the following treatise, I have
remarked that even Plato's Republic, a proverbial example of an empty
ideal, is essentially the embodiment of nothing other than the nature
of Greek ethics; and Plato, aware that the ethics of his time were
being penetrated by a deeper principle which, within this context,
could appear immediately only as an as yet unsatisfied longing and
hence only as a destructive force, was obliged, in order to counteract
it, to seek the help of that very longing itself. But the help he required
had to come from above, and he could seek it at first only in a
particular

external form of Greek ethics.

By this means, he imagined

he could overcome the destructive force, and he thereby inflicted the
gravest damage on the deeper drive behind it, namely free infinite
personality. But he proved his greatness of spirit by the fact that the
very principle on which the distinctive character of his Idea turns is
the pivot on which the impending world revolution turned.
What is rational is actual;
and what is actual is rational.22
This conviction is shared by every ingenuous consciousness as well as
by philosophy, and the latter takes it as its point of departure in
considering both the

spiritual and the natural universe. If reflection,
teJ�ling,Jlr-wh� r form the sub' 've consciousness �e
---:.' regards the presetlt as vain and looks beyond it m a spm of superior

knowledge, it finds itself in a vain position; and since it has actuality

only in the present, it is itself mere vanity. Conversely, if the
seen as 'only an idea', a representation

[Vor.stelltmg]

Idea is

in the realm of

opinion, philosophy affords the opposite insight that nothing is actual
except the Idea. For what matters is to recognize in the semblance of
the temporal and transient the substance which is immanent and the
eternal which is present. For since the rational, which is synonymous

with the Idea, becomes actual by entering into external existence
20

T
I

Prefoce
[Existenz], it emerges in an infinite wealth of forms, appearances, and
shapes and surrounds its core with a brightly coloured covering in
which consciousness at first resides, but which only the concept can
penetrate in order to find the inner pulse, and detect its continued
beat even within the external shapes. But the infinitely varied circum­
stances which take shape within this externality as the essence
manifests itself within it, this infinite material and its organization, are
not the subject-matter of philosophy. To deal with them would be to
interfere in things [Di1lge] with which philosophy has no concern, and
it can save itself the trouble of giving good advice on the subject. Plato
could well have refrained from recommending nurses never to stand
still with children but to keep rocking them in their arms; and Fichte
likewise need not have perfected his passport regulations to the point of
'constructing', as the expression ran, the requirement that the pass­
ports of suspect persons should carry not only their personal descrip­
tion but also their painted likenessP In deliberations of this kind, no
trace of philosophy remains, and it can the more readily abstain from
such ultra-wisdom because it is precisely in relation to this infinite
multitude of subjects that it should appear at its most liberal. In this
way, philosophical science will also show itself furthest removed from

This treatise, therefore, in so far as it deals with political science,
shall be nothing other than an attempt to comprehend a1ld portray the

must distance itself as far as possible from the obligation to construct
a state as it ought to be; such instruction as it may contain cannot be
aimed at instructing the state on how it ought to be, but rather at
showing how the state, as the ethical universe, should be recognized.

his own time or leap over Rhodes.25 If his theory does indeed
transcend his own time, if it builds itself a world as it ought to be, then
it certainly has an existence, but only within his opinions - a pliant

With little alteration, the saying just quoted would read:

Here is the rose, dance here.26
What lies between reason as self-conscious spirit and reason as
present actuality, what separates the former from the latter and
prevents it from finding satisfaction in it, is the fetter of some abstrac­
tion or other which has not been liberated into [the form of] the
concept. To recognize reason as the rose in the cross of the present;27
and thereby to delight in the present - this rational insight is the

reconciliation with actuality which philosophy grants to those who have
to comprehend, to preserve their subjective

received the inner call

freedom in the realm of the substantial, and at the same time to stand
with their subjective freedom not in a particular and contingent situa­
tion, but in what has being in and for itself.
This is also what constitutes the more concrete sense of what was
described above in more abstract terms as the

unity offonn arId cotltent.

For flrol in its most concrete significance is reason as conceptual
cognition, and

content

is reason as the substantial essence of both

ethical and natural actuality; the conscious identity of the two is the
philosophical Idea. - It is a great obstinacy, the kind of obstinacy
which does honour to human beings, that they are unwilling to
acknowledge in their attitudes

[Gesimlzmg]

anything which has not

been justified by thought - and this obstinacy is the characteristic
property of the modem age, as well as being the distinctive principle
of Protestantism. What Luther inaugurated as faith in feeling and in
the testimony of the spirit is the same thing that the spirit, at a more
mature stage of its development, endeavours to grasp in the

CotlCept so

as to free itself in the present and thus find itself therein. It has
become a famous saying that 'a half-philosophy leads away from God'
- and it is the same half-measure which defines cognition as an
approximation to the truth - 'whereas true philosophy leads to God' /8
the same applies to philosophy and the state. Reason is not content
with an approximation which, as something 'neither cold nor hot', it
'spews out of its mouth' /9 and it is as little content with that cold
despair which confesses that, in this temporal world, things are bad or

Preface
at best indifferent, but that nothing better can be expected here, so
that for this reason alone we should live at peace with actuality. The
peace which cognition establishes with the actual world has more
warmth in it than this.

A further word on the subject of

issuing instroctions

on how the

world ought to be: philosophy, at any rate, always comes too late to
perform this function. As the

thought of the world, it appears only at a

time when actuality has gone through its formative process and
attained its completed state. This lesson of the concept is necessarily
also apparent from history, namely that it is only when actuality has
reached maturity that the ideal appears opposite the real and
reconstructs this real world, which it has grilsped in its substance, in
the shape of an intellectual realm.30 When philosophy paints its grey
in grey, a shape of life has grown old, and it cannot be rejuvenated,
but only recognized, by the grey in grey of philosophy; the owl of
Minerva begins its flight only with the onset of dusk.31

But it is time to conclude this foreword; as a foreword, its function
was in any case merely to make external and subjective comments on
the point of view of the work to which it is prefaced. If a content is to
be discussed philosophically, it will bear only scientific and objective
treannent; in the same way, the author will regard any criticism
expressed in a form other than that of scientific discussion of the
matter

[Sache]

itself merely as a subjective postscript and random

assertion, and will treat it with indifference.

Introduction

§ I
The subject-matter of the philosophical science ofright is the Idea ofright

- the concept of right and its actualization.

I

�

Philosophy has to do with Ideas and therefore not with what
are commonly described as mere COllcepts. On the contrary, it
shows that the latter are one-sided and lacking in truth, and
that it is the COllcept alone (not what is so often called by that
name, but which is merely an abstract determination of the
�ding)
and in such a way that it
gives actuality to itself. Everything other than(tliisacfiTIilitp
(wlllC1:l1SPOsite-d-brthln:oncept ItselD is transitory existence
[Daseill], external contingency, opinion, appearance without
essence, untruth, deception, etc. The shape which the concept
assumes in its actualization, and which is essential for cogni­
tion of the COllcept itself, is different from its jOnn of being
purely as coIicept, and is the other essential moment of the
Idea.

�,

.

Additioll (H). The concept and its existence [Existt'1lz] are two aspects [of
the same thing], separate and united, like soul and body. The body is the
same life as the soul, and yet the two can be said to lie outside one
another. A soul without a body would not be a living thing, and vice versa.
Thus the existence [Daseill] of the concept is its body, just as the latter
so�h_I!roduced it. The buds have the tree within t11Ciand
il
coiitain its entire strength, although they are not yet the tree itself. The
tree corresponds entirely to the simple image of the bud. If the body does

not correspond to the soul, it is a wretched thing indeed. �f existence [Daseill] and the concept, of bod and soul, is the Idea. It is not !
just a armony, �. Nothing lives which is
not in some way Idea. �j2L�ht is fr�dom, and in order to be (
truly apprehended, it must be recognizable in its concept and in the )
concept's existence [Daseill].

�h

§2
The science of right is a part o.fphilosophy. It has therefore to develop
the Idea, which is the reason within an object [Gegetlstalld], out of the

concept; or whatCC;;es to the same thing,it must observe the proper
immanent development of the thing [Sache] itself. As a part [of philo�as a determinate starti1lg poi1lt, which is the result and truth
of what preceded it, and what preceded it is the so-called proof of that
result. Hence the concept of right, so far as its comi1lg i1lto bei1lg is
concerned, falls outside the science of right; its deduction is presup­
posed here and is to be taken as givetl.1

Additio1l (G). Philosophy forms a circle.2 It has an initial or immediate

point - for it must begin somewhere - a point which is not demonstrated
and is not a result. But the starting point of philosophy is immediately
relative, for it must appear at another end-point as a result. Philosophy is
a sequence which is not suspended in mid-air; it does not begin immedi­
ately, but is rounded off within itself.

According to the formal, non-philosophical method of the
sciences, the first thing which is sought and required, at least
for the sake of external scientific form, is the !!J1!;1iJjJl.1l. The
positive science of right cannot be much concerned with this,
however, since its chief aim is to state3h�gh�1
i
[Rechtetls], i.e. what the particular legal determinations are.
I
�
This is the reason for the warning: 'omnis definitio in iure
.l civili periculosa.'a3 And in fact, the more incoherent and inter; nally contradictory the determinations of a [system of] right
are, the less possible it will be to make definitions within it; for

visible in all its nakedness. Thus, in Roman law [das romisc/le
Recht], for example, no definition of a huma1l bei1lg would be

possible, for the slave could not be subsumed under it;
indeed, the status [Stalll!] of the slave does violence to that
concept. The definitions of 'property' and 'proprietor' would
seem equally hazardous in many situations. - But the deduc­
tion of the definition may perhaps be reached by means of
etymology, or chiefly by abstraction from particu�
� ultim�teIy baseaon the ��or;tel­
lung] of human beings. The correctness of the definition isl
then made to depend on its agreement \vith prevailing ideasJ
[Vorstellll1lgen]. This method leaves out of account what is
alone essential to science - with regard to content, the necessity
ofthe thing [Sac/Ie] in and for itself (in this case, of right), and
with regard to form, the nature of the concept. In philosophical cognition, on the other hand, the chief concern is the
and the route by which it has become a
res/ITt [is]1ts proof and deduction. Thus, given that its COTltent is
necessary for itself, the second step is to look around for what
corresponds to it in our ideas [Vor;tellll1lgen] and language.
But this concept as it is for itself in its tn/th may not only be
different from our repre5e1ltatio1l [Vor;tellll1lg] of it: the two
must also differ in their form and shape. If, however, the
representation is not also false in its content, the concept may
well be shown to be contained in it and present in essence
within it; that is, the representation rna be raised to the form
of the concept. But it is so far from being the measure and
'�
criterion of the concept which is necessary and true for itself
that it must rather derive its truth from the concept, and
recognize and correct itself with the help of the latter. - But if,
on the other hand, the former manner of cognition with its
formal definitions, inferences, proofs, and the like has now
virtually disappeared, the other mode which has replaced it is
a bad substitute: that is,-Ideas in general, and hence also the
Idea of right and its further determinations, are taken up and
asserted in immediate fashion as foCfS ofconsciouS1less, and our

method of all, it is also the least philosophical not to mention

here other aspects of this view, which has immediate
relevance [Beziehzl1Ig] to action and not just to cognition.
Whereas the first - adrruttedly formal - method does at least
require the flnn of the concept in its definitions and the flrnl
of lIecessary cognition in its proofs, the mode of immediate
consciousness and feeling makes the subjectivity, con­
tingency, and arbitrariness of knowledge into its principle. - A
familiarity with the nature of scientific procedure in philo­
sophy, as expounded in philosophical logic, is here
presupposed.

"�

Right is in genera!� (a)-lJ:!rough itsfornl ofhaving� within
a [particular] state; and this � is the principle which
underlies knowledge [Kezmtllis] of right, i.e. the positive sciezlce ofright.
(b) In terms of collfezzt, this right acquires a positive element (a)
through the particul�a�iollal clla1"a :OI�yeople, its stage of lzistori­
cal development, and the whole context of relations governed by
1latural llecessity;f (�) through the necessity whereby a system of legal
right must contain the application of the universal concept to the
particular and externally given characteristics of objects [Gegezzstallde]
and instances - an application which is no longer [a matter of] specu­
lative thought and the development of the concept, but [of] subsump­
tion by the understanding; (y) through the fillal deternllnations
required for makillg decjsiolls in actuality.

If the feelings of the heart, [personal] inclinations, and
arbitrariness are set up in opposition to positive right and
laws, philosophy at least cannot recognize such authorities.
That force and tyranny may be an element in positive right is
contingent to the latter, and has nothing to do with its nature.

concept - and another to depict their historical emergence
and the circumstances, eventualities, needs, and incidents
which led to their introduction. This kind of demonstration

shall, however, cite an example of Caecilius' further attempts
to justifY the Twelve Tables against Favorinus, because in so
doing, he employs the eternally deceptive method of the
understanding and its mode of ratiocination, namely by sup­

(a clause which would have benefited Shakespeare's Shylock
in The Merchant a/Venice and which he would most gratefully
have accepted).1l In support of this law, Caecilius puts
forward the good reason that it provided an additional guaran­
tee of good faithand-that, given the abominable nature of the
law, it wa5iiever intended that it should be enforcedY In his
thoughtlessness, he not only fails to reflect that this latter
provision [Bestimmu1Ig] frustrates the former intention, namely
that the law should guarantee good faith, but also overlooks
the fact that he hiiriselfciteSailexample immediately after­
wards of how the law on false witness was rendered ineffec­

Hugo means wheiil1e says that Favorinus did not understand
the law; any schoolboy is capable of understanding it, and
Shylock would have understood better than anyone else the
clause in question, which would have been of so much advan­
tage to him; by 'understanding, Herr Hugo must have meant

if a good reason can be found for such a law. - Incidentally, a
further misunderstanding of which Caecilius convicts
Favorinus in the same context is one to which a philosopher
may readily confess without blushing - namely his failure to
realize that iumentum, which the law specified, 'as distinct
from arcera', as the only mode of transport to be provided to
bring a sick man as witness to the court, should be understood
to signifY not only a horse but also a coach or wagonP Cae­
cilius was able to derive from this legal determination a fur­
ther proof of the excellence and precision of the old laws, for
in determining how a sick witness was to be summoned to
testifY in court, they even went so far as to distinguish not just
between a horse and a wagon, but even between different
kinds of wagon - between a covered and upholstered wagon,
as Caecilius explains, and a less comfortable one. We would
thus be left with a choice between the severity of the original
law and the triviality of such determinations; but to describe
such things, let alone learned eXpositions of them, as 'trivial',
would be among the greatest possible affronts to scholarship
of this and other kinds.
But in the textbook cited above, Herr Hugo also has occa­
sion to speak of rationality in connection with Roman law, and
I was particularly struck by the following points. In his treat­
ment of the pen'odfrom the origin ofthe state to the Twelve Tables
(§§ 3 8 and 3 9), he says that 'people (in Rome) had many
needs and were obliged to work, requiring the assistance of
draught animals and beasts of burden such as we ourselves
possess, that the territory of Rome consisted of alternate hills
and valleys, that the city stood
on a hill, etc. -�
allusions which
were perhaps meant to fulfil the intentions of Montesquieu,
but which will scarcely be found to have captured the latter's
spirit. He then points out (§ 40) 'that the position with regardl !f­
to right was still very far from satisfYing the highest demands o d '
reason'. (This is quite correct; Roman family law
[Familienrecht], slavery, etc. do not satisfY even the most
modest demands of reason.) But in dealing with later periods,
Herr Hugo forgets to tell us in which of them, if any, Roman
law satisfied the highest demands of reason. In § 289, however,
Herr Hugo says of the classical jurists in the period of the
33

highest development [Ausbildzmg] ofRomall law as a science 'that it
has long since been noticed that the classical jurists had a
philosophical education'; but 'few people are aware' (although
the many editions of Herr Hugo's textbook have ensured that
more people are now aware) 'that no category of writers is so
eminently deserving as these same Roman jurists to be likened
to the mathematicians in respect of logical deduction from
first principles or to the new founder ofmetaphysics in respect
of the strikingly distinctive way in which they develop their
concepts - the latter being confirmed by the renzarkable fact
that there are nowhere so many trichotomies as in the classical
jurists and in Kant'. - That logical consistency which Leibniz
praises is certainly an essential characteristic of the science of
right, as of mathematics and every other science of the under­
standing; but this logical consistency of the understanding has
nothing to do with the satisfaction of the demands of reason
and with philosophical science.14 Apart from this, however,
the very il1C01lsistency of the Roman jurists and praetors should
be regarded as one of their greatest virtues, for it enabled
them to,. ����.b.JN le

stitutions, although they were at the same time compelled to
illv tYerbal distinctions on the ' �y" (as when they called
bOllomm'posuSJit! what nevertheless amounted to an
inheritance)15 and even silly excuses (and silliness is equally
an inconsistency) in order to preserve the letter of the Twelve
Tables, for example by the fiction or pretenceb that a daughter
was a son( (see U. G.] Heineccius, A1ltiquitatum Romallanl11z
. . . liber I [Frankfurt, 1 77 I], tit. II, § 2 4).16 - But it is ludicrous
to see the classical jurists lumped together with Kant because
of a few trichotomous divisions - particularly those cited in
Note 5 to Herr Hugo's remarks - and to see this kind of thing
called 'development of concepts'.

Introduaion

The basis [Boden] of right is the realm of spirit in general and its
precise location and point of departure is the will; the will is free, so
that freedom constitutes its substance and destiny [Bestimmullg] and
the system of ri ht is the realm of actualized freedom, the world of
spirit produced from within itself as a second nature.

Additi01l (H,G). The freedom of the will can best be explained by

reference to physical nature. For freedom is just as much a basic
determination of the will as weight is a basic determination of bodies. If
matter is described as heavy, one might think that this predicate is merely
contingent; but this is not so, for nothing in matter is weightless: on the
contrary, matter is weight itself. Heaviness constitutes the body and is the
body. It is just the same with freedom and the will, for that which is free is
the will. Will without freedom is an emp word, just as freedom is actual
only as .rillor as subject. But as for the connection between the will and
thought, the following remarks are necessary. Spirit is thought in general,
and the human being is distinguished from the animal by thought But it
must not be imagined [sich vorstellro] that a human being thinks on the
one hand and wills on the other, and that he has thought in one pocket
and volition in the other, for this would be an empty representation
[Vorstelltl1lg]. The distinction between thought and will is simply that
petween theo�tical and ractical attitudes. But they are not two separate
faculties; on the contrary the will is a articular way of thinking - thinking
translating itselfinto existence [ aseill], thinking as e drive to give itself
existence. This distinction between thought and will can be expressed as
follows. When I think of an object [Gegrostalld], I make it into a thought
and ��; ,�
� �e. For it is only when I think that I am
with myself [bei mir], and it is only by com rehendin it that I can
penetrate an object; it then �o . onger stanas Oil osed to me and I have
" eprived it of that uality of its own which it had for itself in op osition to
me. ust as Adam says to Eve: 'You are flesh of my flesh and bone of my
botie'/ so does spirit say: 'This is spirit of my spirit, and its alien character
has disappeared.' 9:'-��entation [Vorstelltl1zgl)s a gem:ralizati,9)1,
and this is inherent in thought. To generalize somethin means to think
it. 'I' is thought and l�se the�l.JY!!�!�L��_L.�

Philosophy ofRight

[atlj7zebe] its opposition and make its content my own. 'I' is at home
in the world when it knows it, and even more so when it has compre­
hended it. So much for the theoretical attitude. The practical attitude, on
the other hand, begins with thought, with the I itself, and seems at first
to be opposed [to the world] because it immediately sets up a separation.
In so far as I am practical or active, Le �
myself, and to determine myself means redsel to osit a difference. But
these differences whic I posit are nevertheless also mine, the determina­
tions apply to me, and the ends to which I am impelled belong to me. Now
even if I let go of these determinations and differences, Le. ifI posit them
in the so-called external world, they still remain mine: they are what I
have done or made, and they bear the imprint of my mind [Geist]. This,
then, is the distinction between theoretical and practical attitudes; the
relationship between them must now be described. De theoretica!Js
essentially contained within the practical; the idea [Vorstelltmg] that the
two are separate must be reJecte , or one cannot have a will without
intelligence. On the contrary, . the��
,�. The will determines itself,�d this determination is primarily of an
inward nature, for what I will I represent to myself as my object [Gegetl­
stalld]. The animal acts by instinct, it is �d by something inward and
is therefore also practical; but it has no will, because it does not represent
to itself what it desires. It is equally impossible to adopt a theoretical
attitude or to think without a will, for in thinking we are necessarily active.
The content of what is thought certainly takes on the form of being; but
this being is something mediated, something posited by our activity.
These distinct attitudes are therefore inseparable: they are one and the
same thing, and both moments can be found in every activity, of thinking
and willing alike.
'

'

With regard to the freedom of the will, we may recollect the
older method of cognition. It simply presupposed the represe1/­
tatioll [Vorstellzmg] of the ,vill and attempted to set up a defini­
tion of the will by extracting it from this representation; then,
in the manner of the older empirical psychology, the so-called
proofof the will's freedom was derived from the various feel­
ings and phenomena [Empfilldlmge1/ zwd Erscheitltmgell] of
ordinary consciousness, such as remorse, guilt, and the like,
which could allegedly be explailled only in terms of a free ,vill .
But it is more convenient simply to adhere to the notion that
freedom is give1/ as a foct of consciousness in which we must
simply believe.2 The deduction that the will is free and of what
the will and freedom are - as already remarked in § 2 above -

L

Introduction
is possible only within the context of the whole [of philo­
sophy]. The basic featu�at spirit is
initially intelligence and that the detenninations through which
it proceeds in its development,l!���l
thinking [Vomellen] to thou ht are the way by which it prod.
uces Itsel as will - w ch, as practical spirit in general, is the
proximate truth of intelligence. I have given an account of
these matters in my Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences
(Heidelberg, 1 8 1 7), § § 363-3 99, and hope to deal with them
in greater detail on a future occasion.3 It is all the more
necessary for me to contribute in this way to what I hope will
be a more thorough cognition of the nature of spirit, because,
as I pointed out in the Encyclopaedia (Remarks to § 367), it is
hard to imagine that any philosophical science can be in so
bad and neglected a condition as that doctrine ofspirit which is
usually called 'psychology'.4 - And as for those elements
[Momente] of the concept of the will which are mentioned in
this and the following paragraphs of the Introduction and
which result from the premise referred to above, it is possible
to form an idea [Vorstellen] of them by consulting the self­
consciousness of any individual. In the first place, anyone can
discover in himself an ability to abstract from an
what­
soever, and likewise to determine himself, to posit any content
������----��----���
in himself by his own agency; and he will likewise have examples of the further detenninations [of the will] within his self­
consciousness.

always contains within itself an essential determination and should there­"
'
fore not be dismissed; but the defect of the understandin is that it treats
a one-sidedCIeteITiiinanon as unique and elevates it to su reme status. i r.­
­
This form of freedom occurs frequen y m IStOry. The Hindus, for
example, place the highest value on mere persistence in the knowledge of
one's simple identity with oneself, on remaining within this empty space
of one's inwardness like colourless light in pure intuition, and on
renouncing every activity of life, every end, and every representation
[Vorstelltmg]. In this way, the human being becomes Brahman. There is no
longer any distinction between the finite human being and Brahman;
instead, every difference [Dijfrrenz] has disappeared in this universality.
This form [of freedom] appears more concretely in the active fanaticism
of both political and religious life. An example of this was the Reign of
Terror in the French Revolution, during which all differences of talents
and authority were supposed to be cancelled out [atljgehoben]. This was a
time of trembling and quaking and of intolerance �
particular. For fanaticism wills only what is abstract, not what is artiCUra:ted,so that whenever differences emerge, it finds them incompatible
,vith its own in ete
acy an cancels ern [he t sle atif]. his is why the
people, urmg the Frenc
evo ution, destroyed once more the institutions they had themselves created, because all institutions are incompatible with the abstract self-consciousness of equality.

(�) In the same way, 'J' is the transition from undifferentiated
indeterminacy to dijftrentiation, detemlination, and e oSltmg of a

or the concrete universality of the concept, but only something
detemlinate and one-sided. For since it is abstraction from all
determinacy, it is itself not without determinacy; and the fact

that it is abstract and one-sided constitutes its determinacy,
deficiency, and finitude. - The differentiation and determina­

the understanding). Consequently, . this abstract 'I' for itselfis

general, whether as a given external limit or as an activity of

The further step which speculative philo­
sophy had to take was to apprehend the negativity which is
immanent within the universal or the identical, as in the 'J' - a
step the need for which is not perceived by those who fail to
apprehend the dualism of infinity and finitude, even in that
immanent and abstract form in which Fichte understood it.

freedom in the form of feeling [Empfilldllllg], for example in fiiendshiJ>
and love.2 �ne-sidedly within ourselves�

limits itself exclusively to a this is the \vill of the stubborn person who

separately [{tir sich] considered any further here.
Additioll (H). The consideration of the \viU's determinacy is the task of the
understanding and is not primarily��e. The will is determined by
no means only in the sense of content, but also in the sense of form. Its
determinacy with regard to form is its end and the accomplishment of its
end. At first this end is only subjective and internal to me, but it should also
become objective and throw off the deficiency of mere subjectivity. One
may ask here why it has this deficiency. If that which is deficient does not
at the same time stand above its deficiency, then its deficiency does not
exist for it. For us an animal is deficient, but not for itself. In so far as an
end is still only ours, it is for us a deficiency, for to us, freedom and will
are the unity of the subjective and the objective. Hence the end must be
posited objectively, and it thereby attains not a new one-sided determina­
tion but only its realization.

aTranslator's tlote: The distinction between the adjective fom/al and the precediogfonnell
appears to carry no particular sigoificance. On subsequent occasions io the Rechts­
philosophie (for example, § 1 23 and Hegel's Remarks to § § 13, IS, I 1 S, 135, 1 39, 261,

This content, or the distinct detennination of the will, is primarily

Two points should be noted in this connection: first that,
because the true is simply the Idea, we do not yet possess an
object or detennination in its truth if we grasp it only as it is in
itselfor in its concept; and secondly, that something as concept
or in itself likewise exists, and this existence [Eristenz] is a
shape proper to the object (as with space in the above exam­
ple). The separation which is present in the finite world
between being-in-itself and being-for-itself at the same time
constitutes the finite world's mere

(immediate examples of this will arise in connec-

tion with the natural will and then with formal right, etc.). The
understanding stops at mere

freedom in accordance . with this being-in-itself a

�

[Veml0ge71], since it is indeed in this case
[Moglichkeit]. But the understanding regards this

detennina­

tion as absolute and perennial, and takes the relationship

[Beziehtl71g]

of freedom to what it wills, or in general to its

reality, merely as its

application

to a given material, an appli­

cation which does not belong to the essence of freedom itself.
In this way, the understanding has to do with the abstract
alone, not with the Idea and truth of freedom.1

Addition (G). The will which is a will only in accordance with its concept is

free in itselfbut at the same time unfree, for it would be truly free only as
a truly determinate content; in the latter case, it is free for itself, has
freedom as its object, and is freedom. Whatever is still only in accordance
with its concept, whatever is merely in itself, is only immediate, only
natural. We are also familiar with this in representational thought [iTl der

§ II
The will which is free as yet only

iTz itselfis

the

immediate or natural /

will. The determinations of the difference which is posited within the

will by the self-determining concept appear within the immediate will
as an

immediately present content: these are the drives, desires, and
inclinations by which the will finds itself naturally determin�d. This

content, along with the determinations developed within it, does

)

indeed originate in the will's rationalilX and-it IS thus rational in itself

but expressed in so immediate a form, it does not yet have the form of
rationality.1

�

For me,

this content is admittedly entirely

mine; but this
a finite will

form and that content are still different, so that the will is

within itself.
Empirical psychology relates- and describes these drives and
inclinations and the needs derived from them as it encounters
them, or believes it encounters them, in experience, and

attempts to classifY this given material in the usual way. We
shall discuss below what the

objective element of these drives

is, what shape this element assumes in its truth (without the
form of irrationality which it possesses as drive), and also what

[Existenz].

Addition (H). The anintal, too, has drives, desires, and inclinations, but it
has no will and must obey its drive if nothing external prevents it. But the
human being, as wholly indeterminate, stands above his drives and can
determine and posit them as his own. The drive is part of nature, but to
,
posit it in this '! depends upon my will, which therefore cannot appeal to
the fact that the drive is grounded in nature.

universal and indeterminate which has all kinds of objects [Gegm­

in this double indeterminacy, gives itself the form of il1dividuality
[Eil1zelheit] (see § 7), it is a resolving will, and only in so far as it makes
any resolutions at all is it an actual will.

itself, as something neutral yet infinitely fruitful, the original
seed of all existence [Dasein], contains its determinations and
ends within itself, and merely brings them forth from within.

universality upon its ends that the will cancels [aufhebt] the

infinite will. Thus those who believe that the human being is
infinite in the realm of the will in general, but that he - or
reason itself - is limited in the realm of thought, have little
understanding of the nature of thinking and willing. 1 In so far
as thinking and willing are still distinct, it is rather the con­
verse which is true, and thinking reason, as will, is [reason]
deciding [sicll entschliej1en] on its own finitude.
A will which resolves on nothing is not an actual will; the
characterless man can never resolve on anything. The reason [Gnmd] for
such indecision may also lie in an over-refined sensibility which knows
that, in determining something, it enters the realm of finitude, imposing a
limit on itself and relinquishing iiiliIiftJ;" yet it does not wish to renounce

§§ 6 and I I); but since it is indeterminate, it is not restricted to this or
that content in particular. To this extent, this content is only a poss­

something else, of choosing between these determinations which the 'I'
must in this respect regard as external. I

§ 15
The freedom of the will, according to this determination, is arbitrari­
ness, in which the following two factors are contained:---free reflection,--which abstracts from everything, and dependence on an inwardly or
� given content and material. Since this content, which is
necessaryfuitser
�the same time determined as a
possible content in opposition to free reflection, it follows that
arbitrariness is cotltingetlCY in the shape of will.
The commonest idea [Vorstellung] we have of freedom is that
of arbitrariness - the mean position of reflection between the
will as determined solely by natural drives and the will which
is free in and for itself. When we hear it said that freedom in
general consists in l!!JEg�s, such an idea
[Vorstelltmg] can only be taken to indicate a complete lack of
intellectual culture [Bildtmg des Cedarlke1ls]; for it shows not
the least awareness ofwhat constitutes the will which is free in
and for itself, or right, or ethics, etc. Reflection, the fomlal

Instead of being the will in its truth, arbitrariness is rather the

actually free or whether our knowledge of its freedom is
merely a delusion, it was arbitrariness which people had in

's��O{free self-determination is
immanent within arbitrariness, whereas the other element is
something given to it, arbitrariness may indeed be called a
delusion if it is supposed to be equivalent to freedom. In all

� as in that of Kant and subsequently in

Fries's utterly superficial revision of it, freedom is nothing
other than this formal self-activity.2

niversality of the will, whereby I can make this or that [thing]

mine. This [thing] which is mine is a particular content and is therefore
incompatible with me; thus it is separate from me and is only potentially
mine, just as I am only the potentiality of uniting with it. The choice
therefore lies in the indeterminacy of the '1' and the determinacy of the
content. gecauseor this content, the
aIthOugh it has in itself the aspect of infinity in a fonnal sense. None of
these contents is�eping with it, and it does not truly have itself in any
of them. It is inherent in arbitrariness that the content is not determined
as mine by the nature of my will, but by contingency; thus I am also
dependent on this content, and this is the contradiction which underlies·.
@ibi!rariness. The common man thinks that he is free when he is allowed
to act arbitrarily, but this very arbitrariness implies that he is not free.
When I will what is rational, I act not as a particular [partikuiares]
individual, but in accordance with the concepts of ethics in general: in an
ethical act, I vindicate not myself but the thing [die Sache]. But a person
who does so�perverse

ticularity [Partikuia

follows and where no one stands out from the rest. When great artists
complete a work, we can say that it had to be so; that is, the artist's
particularity has completely disappeared and no matmerism is apparent in
it. Phidias has no mannerisms; the shape itself lives and stands out. But
� poorer� artist is,!h.e more we see of himself, of his particularity and
arbitrariness.3 If we stop our enquiry at arbitrariness, at the human
being's ability to will this or that, this does indeed constitute his freedom;
but if we bear firmly in mind that the content of what he wills is a given
one, it follows that he is determined by it and is in this very respect no
longer free.

§ 16
Whatever the will has decided to choose (see § 1 4), it can likewise
relinquish (see § 5 ). But with this possibility of proceeding in turn
beyond any other content which it may substitute for the previous
one, and so on ad infinitum, it does not escape from finitude, because
every such content is different from the form [of the will] and there­
fore finite; and the opposite of determinacy namely indeterminacy,
indecision, or abstraction - is only the other, equally one-sided
moment.

That contradiction which is the arbitrary will (see § I S) makes its
appearance as a dialeaic of drives and inclinations which conflict with
each other in such a way that the satisfaction of one demands that the
satisfaction of the other be subordinated or sacrificed, and so on; and
since a drive is merely the simple direction ofits own determinacy and
therefore has no yardstick within itself, this determination that it
should be subordinated or sacrificed is the contingent decision of
arbitrariness - whether the latter is guided by calculations of the
understanding as to which drive ,vill afford the greater satisfaction, or
by any other consideration one cares to name.
Addition (H). Drives or inclinations are primarily a content of the will, and
only reflection stands above them; but these drives [Triebe] themselves
become impelling [treibelld], pres� upon each other, and conflict with each
other, andallOf them wish to b.e satisfied. · If, then, I put all the others
aside and comffiit myself to only one.of them, I find myself in a destructive

a system of all' drives; But'it is of just as little help merely to subordinate
certain drives [to others] - the course of actiop. to which the understand­

man i s said to be by nature good. But
detenllinati01zs o{nature, opposed to freedom and
to the concept of the spirit in general and therefore negative, they must

decision in favour of one assertion or the other likewise depends on

subjective arbitrariness.

I

Addition (H). The Christian doctrine that man is by nature evil is superior
to the other according to which he is good. Interpreted philosophically,
this doctrine should be understood as. follows. As spirit, man is a free
being [Wesen] who is in a position not to let himself be determined by
natural drives. When he exists in an immediate and uncivilized
[/I1zgebildetetl] condition, he is therefore in a situation in which he ought
not to be, and from which he must liberate himself. This is the meaning
·
of �e doctrine of original sin, without which Christianity would not be
the religion of freedom.

§ I9
Underlying the demand for the purification
idea

[Vorstellung]

of the drives is the general

that they should be freed from the

fomz

of their

immediate natural determinacy and from the subjectivity and con­
tingency of their

colllent,

and restored to their substantial essence.

The truth behind this indeterminate demand is that the drives should
become the rational system of the will's determination; to grasp them
thus in terms of the concept is the content of the science of right.
The content of this science can be expounded, with reference
to all its individual moments sU(::h as right, property, morality,
family, the state, etc., in the following form: man has by nature

and also a drive towards property and
and also a drive towards sexual love, a drive towards

a drive towards right,

morality,

sociability, etc.

I

If one prefers to accord the dignity of a

philosophical shape to this form of empirical psychology, then
this, in the light of what has passed in recent times for philo­
sophy (as was earlier noted) and continues to pass for it, can
be achieved

at low cost

within himself, as a ftct

simply by declaring that man finds

ofhis consciousness, that he wills right,

property, the state, etc. This same content, which appears
here in the shape of 2drives, will recur later in another form,
namely that of duties.

In happiness, thought already has some power over the
natural force of the drives, for it is not content with the instantaneous, but
requires a whole of happiness. This is connected with education to the
extent that education likewise implements a universal. But two moments
are present in the ideal of happiness: the first is a universal which is
superior to all particularities; but secondly, since the content of this
universal is in turn merely universal pleasure, the individual and particu­
lar, i.e. a finite quantity, reappears at this point, and we are compelled to
return to the drive. Since the content of happiness lies in the subjectivity
and feeling [Empfilldtmg] of everyone, this universal end is itself particular
fpartiklllar], so that no true unity of content and fonn is yet present within
it.

seded and raised to the universal is what is called the activity
'Of thought. The self-consciousness which purifies and raises
its object, content, and end to this universality does so as
thought asserting itself in the will . Here is the point at which it
becomes clear that it is only as thinking intelligence that the will
is truly itself and free. The slave does not know his essence,
his infinity and freedom; he does not know himself as an
essence - he does not know himself as such, for he does not
think himself. This self-consciousness which comprehends
Itself as essenc�gh thought and thereby divests itself of
me contingent and the untrue constitutes the principle of
right, of morality, and of all ethics. Those who speak
philosophically of right, morality, and ethics and at the same
time seek to exclude thought, appealing instead to feeling,
heart, emotion, and inspiration, bear witness to the profound
contempt into which thought and science have fallen; for in
their case, science itself, having sunk into despair and total
lassitude, even adopts barbarism and thoughtlessness as its
principle and does everything it can to rob mankind of all
truth, worth, and dignity.

speaking only of the predispositi011 towards freedom or of the
natural and finite will (see § I I), and therefore not - whatever
one may say and believe - of the free will. - When the under­
standing regards the infinite merely as something negative
and hence as beyond its sphere, it believes that it is doing the
infinite all the more honour by pushing it ever further away
and distancing it as something alien. In the free will, the truly

§§ 22-26

The first thing which the expression 'universality' suggests to
representational thought [dem Vorstellen] is an abstract and
external universality; but in the case of that universality which
has being in and for itself, as defined here, we should think
neither of the universality of reflection - i.e. communality or
totality - nor of that abstract universality which stands outside
and in opposition to the individual - i.e. the abstract identity
of the understanding (see Remarks to § 6). The universality in
question is concrete within itself and consequently has being
for itself, and it is the substance of the self-consciousness, its
immanent generic character [Gattung] or immanent idea; it is
the concept of the free will as the universal which extends beyond
its object, which permeates its determination and is identical
"
with itself in this determination. - The universal which haS )
bein in and for itself is in eneral �
and it can be understood only in this speculative way.

The subjective, as far as the will in general is concerned, denotes the

_, � [Einzelheit] (see § 7)

as

distinct rom its conce t which has bein ill itself. The subjectivity of
the will therefore denotes (a)��
pure ./2ml, the absolute unity of the self-

consciousness with itself, in which the self-consciousness, as�,
is
totally inward and abstractly dependent upon itself - i.e. the pure
�
certainty of itself, as distinct from truth; (�) the particulan�ty of the will
as arbitrariness and as the co tingent con�

belonging to the self-consciousness, an unaccomplished end.

(y) finally, objectivity is the one-sided form opposed to the subjective
�
determination of the will, and is thus ;the
immediacy of existence
[Daseil1] as extemal existence [Existenz]
objective �until its end'"Sare�
These logical determinations of subjectivity and objectivity
have been listed here in order that we may expressly note in
relation to them - since they will often be employed in what
follows - that, like other distinctions and antithetical
determinations of reflection, they pass over into their
opposites on account of their finitude and hence of their
dialectical nature. Other such antithetical determinations,
however, � a fixed significance for representational
thought [Vorstelltlng] and for the understanding, because their
identity is still only of an inward kind. In the will, on the other
hand, such antitheses - which are supposed to be abstract, yet
at the same time determinations of the will which can be
known- only as the concrete - lead by themselves to their own
identity and to a confusion of their meanings, a confusion into
which the understanding quite unwittingly falls. - Thus the
will, as freedom with inward being, is subjectivity itself; subject­
ivity is accordingly the will's concept and hence its objectivity;
but its subjectivity, as opposed to objectivity, is finitude; yet in
this very opposition, the will is not with itself but involved with
the object, and its finitude consists just as much in the fact
that it is not subjective, etc. - Thus, the significance to be
attached in what follows to the subjective or objective aspects
of the will should in each case be apparent from the context,
which defines their position with reference to the totality.

Addition (1-1). It is usually believed that the subjective and objective are
finnly opposed to one another. But this is not the case; they in fact pass
over into one another, for they are not abstract determinations like posi­
tive and negative, but already have a more concrete significance. If we
first consider the term 'subjective'" this may denote an end peculiar to a
specific subject. In this sense, a veryb�rk�
�its purpose [Saclze] is purely subjective. But the same term may also be
applied to the content of the will, and it is then roughly synonymous with
�: a.!��t�� to the subject.
Thus bad actions, for exam Ie, are merely subjective. - �n,

since everything which I am to recognize also has the task of becoming

are mere thoughts which we set up in opposition to ourselves. But we also
comprehend [under objectivity] the immediacy of existence [Dasehz] in
which the end is to be realized: even if the end is itself wholly particular
[partikular] and subjective, we nevertheless call it objective as soon as it
makes its appearance. But the objective will is also that in which truth is
present. Thus the will of God, the ethical will, is objective. Finally, we
may also aescn'be as objective the will which i�completely immersed inits
object [Objekt], such as the Will of the child, which is founded on trust and

���� The absolute determination or, if one prefers, the absolute drive, of
the free spirit (see § 21) is to make its freedom into its object [Gege1l­

rational system of the spirit itself, and in the sense that this system
becomes immediate actuality (see § 26). This enables the spirit to be
for itself, as Idea, what the will is in itself. The abstract concept U

In the Kantian definition [Bestimmzmg] of right (see the
introduction to Kant's Theory ofRight [Metaphysische Allfimgs­
grihzde der Reelztslehre, 1 797]), which is also more widely
accepted, the essential element [Momelll] is 'the /imitatioll of
my freedom or arbitrary will in such a way that it may coexist
with the arbitrary will of everyone else in accordance with a
universal law'.2 On the one hand, this definition contains only
a llegative determination - that of limit�tion; and on the other
hand, the positive [element] - the universal law or so-called
'law of reason', -the consonance of the arbitrary will of one
individual with that of the other - amounts simply to the
familiar [principle of] formal identity and the law of contradic­
tion. The definition of right in question embodies the view,
especially prevalent since Rousseau, according to which the
substantial basis and primalY factor is supposed to be not the
will as rational will which has being in and for itself or the
spirit as true spirit, but will and spirit as the particular
individual, as the will of the .iliig���-tde�is
distinctive arbitrariness.3 Once this principle is accepted, the
rational can of course appear only as a limitation on the
freedom in question, and not as an immanent rationality, but
only as an external and formal uruverSaf. This view is devoid
of any speculative thought and is refuted by the philosophical
concept, and has at the same time produced phenomena [Er­
sclzeimmgen] in people's Ininds and in the actual world whose
terrifYing nature is matched only by the shallowness of the
thoughts on which they are based.4

Introduction

Right is something utterly sacred, for the simple reason that it is the
existence [Daseill] of the absolute concept, of self-conscious freedom.
- But the fomlalism of right and also of duty! - arises out of the
different stages in the development of the concept of freedom. In
opposition to the more formal, i.e. more abstract and hence more
limited kind of right, that sphere and stage of the spirit in which the
spirit has determined and actualized within itself the further moments
contained in its Idea possesses a higher right, for it is the more COllcrete
sphere, richer within itself and more truly universal.
Each stage in the development of the Idea of freedom has its

�t, because it is the existence of freedom in one

/

of its own determinations. When we speak of the opposition
between morality or ethics and right, the right in question is
merely the initial and formal right of abstract personality.
Morality, ethics, and the interest of the state - each of these is
a distinct variety of right, because each of them gives determi­
nate shape and existence to freedom. They can come into
collisioll only in so far as they are all in equal measure rights; if
the moral point of view of the spirit were not also a right - i.e.
freedom in one of its forms - it could not possibly come into
collision with the right of personality or with any other right,
because every right embodies the concept of freedom, the
highest d�termination of spirit, in relation to which everything
else is without substance. But a collision also contains this
further moment: it imposes a limitation whereby one right is
subordinated to another; only the right of the world spirit is
absolute in an unlimited sense.

The method whereby the concept, in science, develops out of itself
and is merely an immallent progression and production of its own
determinations is likewise assumed to be familiar from logic. Its pro­
gress does not depend on the assertion that various circumstances are
prese1lt or on the subsequent applicatioll of the universal to such
material of extraneous origin.

Philosophy ofRight
The�� the �t, �����s
the particularizations of ilieuniversal but also produces them,
is w at I call dialectic. I consequently do not mean that kin of
-al� an object [Gegetlsta1ld], proposition, etc.
given to feeling or to the immediate consciousness in general,
and dissolves it, confuses it, develops it this way and that, and
is solely concerned with deducing its opposite - a negative
mode which frequently appears even in Plato. I Such dialectic
may regard as its final result the . opposite of a given idea
[Vorstellu1lg], or, as in the uncompromising manner of ancient
scepticism, its contradiction, or, in a lame fashion, an approx­
imatio1l to the truth which is a modem half-mea��e
l:iigher dialectIc of the concept consIsts not mere y ill produc­
ing and apprehending the detemIination as an opposite and
linIiting factor, but in producing and apprehending th�e
content and result which it co tains; and it is this alone which
. makes it a developmetlt and immanent pro ession. This
- ialectic, then, is not an extema activity of subjective thought,
but the very soul of the content which puts forth its branches
and fruit organically. This development of the Idea as the
activity of its own rationality is something which thought,
since it is subjective, merely observes, without for its part
adding anything extra to it. To consider something rationally
means not to bring reason to bear on the object from outside
in order to work upon it, for the object is itself rational for
itself; it is the spirit in its freedom, the highest apex of self­
conscious reason, which here gives itself actuality and
engenders itself as an existing world; and the sole business of
science is to make conscious this work which is accomplished
by the reason of the thing [Sache] itself.

The detemlil1atiotlS in the development of the concept are on the one
hand themselves concepts, but on the other hand, since the concept is
essentially Idea, they have the form of existence [Daseil1], and the
series of concepts which results is there ore at the same time a series
o�; this is how science should regard them.

are one and the same thing. But it

should be noted that the moments, whose result is a further­
determined form [of the concept], precede it as determina­
tions of the concept in the scientific development of the Idea,
but do not come before it as shapes in its temporal develop­
ment. Thus the Idea, in its determination as the family,
presupposes those determinations of the concept from which,
in a later section of this work, it [i.e. the Idea]

will be shown to

result. But the other side of this development is that these
inner presuppositions should also be present for themselves as

shapes,

such as the right of property, contract, morality, etc.,

and it is only at a more advanced stage of culture

[Bildzmg] that

the moments of development attain this distinctive shape of
existence.

�ons

concept remains the soul which holds everything together and which
arrives at Its own differentiation only through an immanent ocess.-ane
cannOt therefore say that the concept arrives at anything new; on the

pr

contrary, the last determination coincides in unity with the first. Thus,

even if the concept appears to have become fragmented in its existence,
this is merely a semblance, as is subsequently confirmed when all its
details finally return in the concept of the universal. In the empirical
sciences, it is customary to analyse what is found in representational
thought [Vorstellzmg], and when the individual instance has been reduced
to the common quality, this common quality is then called the concept.
This is not how we proceed, for we merely wish to observe how the
concept determines itself, and we force ourselves not to add anything of
our own thoughts and opinions. What we obtain in this way, however, is a
series of thoughts and another series of existent shapes, in which it may
happen that the temporal sequence of their actual appearance is to some
extent different from the conceptual sequence. Thus, we cannot say, for
example, that property existed before the family, although property is
nevertheless dealt with first. One might accordingly ask at this point why
We do not begin with the highest instance, that is, with the concretely true.
The answer will be that we \vish to see the truth precisely in the form of a

result, and it is essential for this purpose that we should first comprehend
the abstract concept itself. What is actual, the shape which the concept
assumes, is therefore from our point of view only the subsequent and
further stage, even if it should itself corne first in actuality. The course we
follow is that whereby the abstract forms reveal themselves not as existing
for themselves, but as untrue.

principle which determines the above subdivisions is likewise
presupposed/ The subdivisions may also be regarded as a

of the parts [of the book], for the various

stages must generate themselves from the nature of the con­

tent itself as moments in the development of the Idea.
Philosophical subdivisions are certainly not an external classi­
fication - i.e. an outward classification of a given material
based on one or more extraneous principles of organization but the immanent differentiation of the concept itself. -

Morality

and

ethics,

which are usually regarded as roughly

synonymous, are taken here in essentially distinct senses.2 Yet

even representational thought

[Vorstellung]

seems to dis­

tinguish them; Kantian usage prefers the expression

morality,

as indeed the practical principles of Kant's philosophy are
confined throughout to this concept, even rendering the point
of view of ethics impossible and in fact expressly infringing and

destroying it. But even if morality and ethics were etymologi­

cally synonymous, this would not prevent them, since they are
now different words, from being used for different concepts.

Addition (H). When we speak here of right, we mean not merely civil right,

which is what is usually understood by this term, but also morality, ethics,
and world history. These likewise belong here, because the concept
brings thoughts together in their true relationship. If it is not to remain
abstract, the free will must first give itself an existence [Dasein], and the
primary sensuous constituents of this existence are things [Sac/Iet/], i.e.
external objects [Dinge]. This first mode of freedom is the one which we
should know as property, the sphere of formal and abstract right; property
in its mediated shape as contract, and right in its infringement as crime and

punishme1lt, are no less a part of this sphere. The freedom which we have
here is what we call the person, that is, the subject which is free, and
indeed free for itself, and which gives itself an existence [Dasein] in the
realm of things [Sad/en]. But this mere immediacy of existence is not in

Philosophy ofRight
keeping with freedom, and the negation of this determination is the
sphere of morality. I am then free no longer merely in this immediate
thing [Sadie], but also in a superseded immediacy - that is, I am free in
myself, in the subjective realm. In this sphere, everything depends on my
insight, my intention, and the end I pursue, because externality is now
regarded as indifferent. But the good, which is here the universal end,
should not simply remain with me; on the contrary, it should be realized.
For the subjective will demands that what is internal to it - that is, its end
- should attain an external existence [Dasei11], and hence that the good
should be accomplished in external existence [Existe1/z]. Morality and the
earlier moment of formal right are both abstractions whose truth is
attained only in ethical lifo. Thus, ethical life is the uni of the will in its
, conce{>t and the will of the individual [des Eirlzelrle11], that IS, of the
e
ethiIrg
�f love and feeling [Empfi1Idll1lg] - the fo11lily; here, the individual
[das ltldividl1ll11l] has overcome [atifkehobell] his personal aloofuess and
finds himself and his consciousness within a whole. But at the next stage,
we witness the disappearance of ethical life in its proper sense and of
substantial unity: the family becomes fragmented and its members behave
towards each other as self-sufficient individuals, for they are held
together only by the bond of mutual need. This stage of civil society has
often been equated with the state. But the state emerges only at the third
stage, that of ethical life and spirit, at which the momentous unification of
self-sufficient individuality with universal substantiality takes place. The
right of the state is therefore superior to the other stages: it is freedom in
its most concrete shape, which is subordinate only to the supreme
absolute truth of the world spirit.

Abstract Right

L

The will which is free in and for itself, as it is in its abstraa concept, is
in the determinate condition of immediacy. Accordingly, in contrast
with reality, it is its own negative actuality, whose reference to itself is
purely abstract - the inherently individual [i11 sidl einzelner] will of a
subjea. In accordance with the moment of particularity of the will, it
has in addition ,a content consistin!LQf de..!enninat�s, and as
exclusive individuality [Einzelheit], it simultaneously encounters this
content as an external world immediately confronting it.

Addition (H). When I say that the will which is free in and for itself, as it is
edia�, this
in its abstract concept, is in the determinate ondition of '
should be understood as follows. The completed Idea of the will is that
condition in which the concept has fully realized itself and in which its
existence [Dasehl] is nothing but the concept's own development. Initially,
however� the concept is abstract - that is, although all its determinations
are conta�e no more than contained in it: they have
being only in themselves and have not yet developed into a totality in their
own �at I am free, 'I' is still this being-within-itself
[Insichsehz] without any opposition. In morality, on the other hand, there is
already an o�is sphere, I am present as an individual
will, whereas the good is the universal, even though it is within me. Thus, 5'

sality within itseJf, and is consequently determinate.�n
i�y, for there is no progression or mediation at the first
stage of abstract unity, where the will has the form of immediacy, of
being. The essential insight to be gained here, then, is that this initial
indeterminacy is itself a determinacy. For indete�e
eing no stinction as yet between the will and its content; but
indeterminacy itself, when opposed to the determinate, takes on the
determination of being something determinate; it is abstract identity
which here constitutes its determinacy; the will thereby becomes an
individual will - the person.

Additioll (H). The \vill which has being for itself, or the abstract will , is the

person. The highest achievement of a human being is to be a Person; yet
in spite of this, the simple abstraction 'person' has something con­
temptuous about it, even as an expression.3 The person is essentially
different from the subject, for the subject is only the possibility oCper­

In formal right,

therefore, it is not a question of particular interests, of my advantage
or welfare, and just as little of the particular ground by which my will

Since particularity, in the person, is not yet present as
freedom, everything which depends on particularity is here a matter of
indifference. If someone is interested only in his formal right, this may be

Consequently, a determination of right gives me a warrant, but it is not
absolutely necessary that I should pursue my rights, because this is only
one aspect of the whole relationship. For possibility is being, which also
has the significance of not being.

3 . The resolving and immediate individuality [Einzelheit] of the person

relates itself to a nature which it encounters before it. Hence the
personality of the will stands in opposition to nature as subjective. But
since personality within itself is infinite and universal the limitatiollOf
being merely subjective is in contradiction with it and is mill and void.
fusonality is that which acts to overcome [auftuheben] this limitation
and to give itself reality - or, what amounts to the same thing, to posit
that existence [Daseill] as its own.

(c) The will which, as in (a), is differentiated within itself in its self­
reference rather than distinguished from another person as in (b),
is, as a particular will, different from and opposed to itself as the
will which has being in and for itself. This constitutes wrong and

cnme.

The division of right into the right of persons and things

divisions of this kind, aims primarily to �

chief characteristic of this division is the confused way in
which it jumbles together rights which presuppose substantial
relations, such as family and state, with those which refer only
to abstract personality. Kant's division of rights, which has
since round favour with others, into the right oJthings, tP
the right

example of this confusion. To enlarge upon the lop-sidedness
and conceptual poverty of the division into the right ojpersons

no place in this classification), would take us too far. Here, it

Philosophy ofRight
That so-called philosophy which ascribes reality - in the
sense of self-sufficiency and genuine being-for-and-in-itself
- to immediate individual things [Dingm], to the non-personal
realm, as well as that philosophy which assures us that spirit
cannot recognize truth or know what the thing-in-itselfis/ is
immediately refuted by the attitude of the free will towards
these things [DiTzge]. If so-:called external things have a
semblance of self-sufficiency for consciousness, for intuition
and representational thought, the free will, in contrast, is the
idealism and truth of such actuality.

Addition (H). All things [Dinge] can become the roperty of human bein ,

because the 'numan � and, as such, exists in and for
himself, whereas that which confronts him does not have this quality.
Hence everyone has the right to make his will a thing [Sache] or to make
the thing his will, or, in other words, to supersede the thing and transform
it int�wn:; fo�thin�
��

(the animal) is also exte�s way and is to that exten�
[Sache]. The will alone is infinite, absoillte in relation to everything else,
whereas�ther, for its part,
is merely relative.
Thus to appropriate
.
-\\ something means basically only to manifest ---the supremacy of my will in
f relation to the thing [Sache] and to demonstrate that the latter�
� and for itself and �f. This manifestation
occurs through my conferring upon the thing an end other than that
which it immediately possessed; I give the living creature, as my property,
a soul other than that which it previously had; I give it my soul. The free
will is consequendy that idealism which does �gs [Dinge],
as they are, to be in and for themselves, whereas realism declares them to
be absolute, even if they are found only in the form of finitude. Even the
animal has gone beyond this realist philosophy, for it consumes things
[Dilzge] and thereby proves that they are not absolutely self-sufficient.2

will by this means constitutes the genuine and rightful element in
possession, the determination of property.!
In relation to needs - if these are taken as primary - the
possession of property appears as a means; but the true posi­
tion is that, from the point ofview of freedom, property, as the
first existence [Dasein] of freedom, is an essential end for itself.
2

Since my will , as personal and hence as the will of an individual [des
Einzelnen], b��i!LJ�,�� the latter takes on the
character of private property; and common property, which may by its
nature be owne<royseparate individuals, takes on the determination
of an inherently [an sich dissolvable communi in which it is in itself
ffiir sichl a matter [Sache] for the arbitrary will whether or not I retain
my share in It.

.,�

The utilization of elementary objects is, by its nature, incapable
of being particularized in the form of private possession. The agrarian laws of Rome embody a conflict between com­
munity and priva�e ownership of land; the latter, as the more
rational moment, had to retain its supremacy, albeit at the
expense of other rights.! - Entailed ]amily property contains a
moment which is opposed to the right of personality and
hence of private pfoperly:rBI;:t�
rminations which
concern private property may have to be subordinated to
higher spheres of right, such as a community or the state, as is
the case with private pr��t.IlePfOperty of
a so-called corporate person [moralische Person] or property in
mortmain. Nevertheless, SUCh exceptions cannot be grounded
in contingency, private arbitrariness, or private utility, but only
in the rational organism of the state. - The Idea of Plato's
republic contains as a universal principle a wrong against the
person, inasmuch as the person is forbidden to own �
,g�Q��]r/ The idea [Vorstelltmg] of a pious or friendly or even
compulsory brotherhood of men with communal property and a
ban on the principle of private property may easily suggest
itself to that disposition which misjudges the nature of the

77

�

Philosophy ofRight
freedom of spirit and right and does not comprehend it in its
determinate moments. As for the moral or religious dimen­

sion, when Epicurus' friends planned to establish such an
association with communal property, he prevented them from
doing so for the simple reason

[Grutld]

that their plan dis­

played distrust, and that those who distrust one another are
not friends (Diogenes Laertius, I.x.6).

Additioll (H). In property, my will is personal, but the person is a specific
entity [eitZ Dieses]; thus, property becomes the personal aspect of this
specific will. Since I give my will existence [Daseill] through property,

property must also have the determination of being this specific entity, of
being mine. This is the important doctrine of the necessity of private
property. Even if exceptions may be made by the state, it is nevertheless the
state alone which can make them; but frequendy, especially in our own
times, private property has been restored by the state. Thus, for example,
many states have righdy dissolved [atifkehobetl] the monasteries, because a
community does not ultimately have the same right to property as a
person does.

The fact that, from the point of view that I exist not as the

concept of life and on the concept of the spirit as soul moments which are taken over from the philosophy of nature

It is only because I am alive as a free entity within my body

feel through it. It is therefore only a sophistical understand­

If we may speak here of more than one person where no such
distinction has yet been made, we may say that, in terms of

this demand is all the more vacuous and superficial in that this

infinite particularity and differentiation and in its organically
developed reason. - One cannot speak of an injustice ofnature
in the unequal distribution of possessions and resources, for

That all human beings should have their livelihood [Auskom111e1l] to meet their needs is, on the one hand, a moral wish;
and when it is expressed in this indeterminate manner, it is
indeed well intentioned, but like everything that is merely well
intentioned, it has no objective being. On the other hand, a
livelihood is something other than possession and belongs to
another sphere, that of civil society.

sions. Accordingly, everyone ought to have property.2 Ifwe therefore wish
to speak of equality, It IS this equality which we sh�uld consider. But this
equality is distinct from the determination ofparticularity, from the ques­
tion of how much I possess. In this context, it is false to maintain that

§ 50
That a thing [Sache] belongs to the person who happens to be thefirst to
take possession of itl is an immediately self-evident and superfluous
determination, because a second party cannot take possession of what
is already the property of someone else.

Addition (H). The above determinations have chiefly concerned the prop­
osition that the personality must have existence [Daseill] in property. That
the first person who takes possession of something is also its owner is,
then, a consequence of what has been said. The first is not the rightful
owner because he is the first, but because he is a free will, for it is only the
fact that another comes after him which makes him the first.

My inner idea [Vorstellzl1Ig] and will that something should be mine is
not enough to constitute property, which is the existence [Dasein] of
personality; on the contrary, this requires that I should take possession
of it. The existence which my willing thereby attains includes its ability
to be recognized by others. - That a thing of which I can take
possession �hould be ownerless is (see § 5 0) a self-evident negative
condition; o�o the anticipated relation to others.
�

Addition (H,G). The concept of property requires that a person should
place hiS will in a thing [Sache], and the next stage is precisely the

realization of this concept. My inner act ofwill which says that something
is mine must also become recognizable by others. In make a thing mine, I
give it this prerucate which must appear in it in an external form, and must
not simply remain in my inner will . It often happens that children
emphasize their prior volition when they oppose the appropriation of
81

something by others; but for adults, this volition is not sufficient, for the
form of subjectivity must be removed and must work its way out to
ObJectlVlty.
-------

§ 52
Taking possession of a thing [Sache] makes its matter my property,
�atter in itself [fUr siehl does not own itself.
Matter offers resistance to me (and it consists solely in offer­
ing resistance to me). That is it shows its abstract bein -for­
�tself to me onl in my uality as abstract spirit, namel as
sensuous spirit. (Sensuous representation [Vorstellen] wrongly
�nsuous being of the spirit as concrete and its
rational being as abstract.) But in relation [Beziehung] to the
will and to property, this being-for-itself of matter has no
truth. Taking possession of something, as an external aaivity
whereby the universal right to appropriate natural objects
[Naturdinge] is actualized, falls under the conditions of h sia of ose means whereby
we a��� physical ownership of things. Given the��e
differences�ere are infinitely' varied
senses in which one can take control and poss�ssion of them,
and doing so is subject to equally varied kinds of limitation
and contingency. In any case, the generic and elemental
aspects of something are not as such the objea [Gegenstand] of

�

object and be taken possession of, they must first be individu':t ed (e.g. as a breath 0 air or a 'rfuk of water). With regard
lO1J.ie impossibility of taking possession of an external genus
as such, or of the elemental, the ultimate consideration is not
the external physical impossibility of doing so, but the fact that
the person, as will, determines himself as an individual
[Einzelheit] and, as a person, is at the same_�
imm
�ate
individuality; hence he is also related, as a person, to the
eXternal world as to individual things [Einzelheiten] (see my
Remarks to § 1 3 ; also § 43). The control and external pos­
session [of things] thus becomes, in infinite ways, more or less
indeterminate and incomplete. Matter, however, is never
without an essential form, and it is only by virtue of this form
-

82

1

Abstract Right
that it is something. The more I appropriate this form, the
more I come into actual possession of the thing [Sache]. The
consumption of foodstuffs is a penetration and alteration of
their qualitative nature by virtue ofwhich they were what they
were before they were consumed. The training [AusbildIl71g] of
my organic body in various skills, like the education of my
spirit, is likewise a more or less complete penetration and
taking possession thereof; the spirit is what I can appropriate
most completely. But this actuality of taking possession is dif­
ferent from property as such, which is completed by the free
will. In face of the free will, the thing does not retain any
distinct property for itself" even if possession, as an external
relationship, still retains an external aspect. The empty
abstraction .of a matter without attributes which, in the case of
property, is supposed to remain external to me and the prop­
erty ofthe thing itself, is something which thought must get
the 'better of.
,_

Addition (G). Fichte has raised the question of whether the matter also

belongs to me ifI give it form.I From what he says, it follows that, if I have
made a cup out of gold, anyone else is at liberty to take the gold provided
that he does not thereby damage my handiwork. However separable the
two may be in terms of representation [Vorstefltmg], this distinction is in
fact an empty piece of hair-splitting; for if I take possession of a field and
cultivate it, not only the furrow is my property, but the rest as well, the
earth which belongs to it. For I wish to take possession of this matter as a
whole: it therefore does not remain ownerless or its own property. For
even if the matter remains external to the form which I have given to the
object [Gegensta1ltJ], the form itself is a sign that the thing is to be mine;
the thing therefore does not remain external to my will or outside what I
have willed. Thus, there is nothing there which could be taken possession
of by someone else.

Mechanical forces, weapons, and instruments extend the
range of my power. Connections between my pro�
s�uts upon it may make it more easily poss­
ible for me than for another owner, or even exclusively so for
me, to take possession of something or to make use of it; or
the addition to my property may be regarded as a non-self­
sufficient accident of the thing to which it has been added.1
Such connections may include the fact that my land is beside

T
Abstract Right

§§ 5 3-5 6

the sea or a river, that my fixed property borders on land
suitable for hunting, pasture, or other uses, that stone or other
mineral resources underlie my fields, that there may be
treasure in or under the land which I own, and so on; or the
connections may arise only in the course of time and as a
result of chance, as with some so-called natural accessions,
such as alluvial deposits and the like or items washed ashore.
(The procreation of animals [foettlra] is indeed also an acces­
sion to my resources; but as it is an organic relationship, no
external thing is added to another thing which I already pos­
sess, so that this instance is quite different in kind from other
accessions.)2 All of these are external associations whose bond
of union is neither the concept nor a living force [Lebendigkeit].
It i s therefore the task o f the understanding to adduce and
weigh the reasons for and against them, and of positive
legislation to reach a decision according to whether the rela­
tions [Beziehungen] between the things in question are more or
less essential or inessential.

Additiotl (G). Taking possession is always incomplete in character. I take

possession of no more than I can touch with my body, but it follows
-�ly that external clJTects [Ditlgel eJl.1:end further than I can grasp.
Thus, when I have a specific thing in my possession, something else will
be connected with it. I take possession of things ,vith my hand, but its
reach can be extended. The hand is a great organ which no animal
possesses, and what I grasp with it can itself become a means of reaching
out further. When I possess something, the understanding at once con­
cludes that itls-nofjusfwna:rqJQsSeSsiiiiiiii.'ed ately that is mine, but also
-what is connected with it. Here, positive right must pronounce judge­
ment, for nothing further can be deduced from the concept.

§ 56
(P) When I giveflml to something, its determinate character as mine
receives an independently rfiir sich] existing [bestelzetlde] externality and
ceases to be limited to my presence in this time and space and to my
present knowledge and volition.
To give form to something is the mode of taking possession
most in keeping with the Idea..,inasmuch as it combines the
�tIieoOreCtl�'. Otherwise, it varies infinitely
85

Philosophy ofRight
according to the qualitative nature of the objects [Gegetlstande]
and the variety of subjective ends. - We must also include
here the giving of form to the organic. The effects which I
have on the latter do not remain merely external, but are
assimilated by it, as in the tilling of the soil, the cultivation of
plants, and the domestication, feeding, and conservation of
animals; further examples are the measures we employ in
order to utilize raw materials or the forces of nature, or the
influence which we cause one substance [Sto.ffJ to exert upon
another, and so on.
Addition (H). In empirical contexts, this giving of form may assume the
most varied shapes. The field which I cultivate is thereby given form. As
far as the inorganic realm is concerned, I do not always give it form
directly. If, for example, I build a windmill, I have not given form to the
air, but I have constructed a form in order to utilize the air, which cannot
be taken away from me Just because I have not myself formed it [Le. the
air]. Even the fact that I conserve game may be regarded as a way of
imparting form, for it is a mode of conduct calculated to preserve the
object in question. The training of animals is, of course, a more direct way
of giving them, form, and I play a greater role in this process.

in giving itself an existence which is purely its own and free.
That side of the antinomy which asserts the concept of
freedom thus has the advantage that it contains the absolute

truth, whereas the 9-therSicI�: which goes no further than

-Thfs �se appearance2 [Erscheinung] is associated
with the spirit which has not yet gone beyond the point ofview

stage to the stmgglefor recognition and the relationship of lord­
ship and servitude (see Phenomenology ofSpirit, pp. I I Sff. and

insight which comes only when we recognize that the Idea of

Addition (H). Ifwe hold finnly to the view that the human being in and for

own will is responsible, just as theresponsibility lies with the will of a

or

That use is the real aspect and actuality of property is what
representational thought [Vorstellzmg] has in mind when it
regards disused pro erty as dead and ownerless, and justifies
its unlawful appropriation of it on the grounds that the owner
did not use it. - But the will of the owner, in accordance with
which a thing is his, is the primary substantial basis of prop­
erty, and . the further determination of use is merely the
[outward] appearance and particular mode of this universal
basis to which it is subordinate.

Addition (H,G). While I take complete possession of a thing in a universal

way by designating it as mine, its use embodies an even more universal
relation, because the .thing is not then recognized in its particularity, but is
.ne�ted by me. The thing is reduced to a means of satisfYing my need.
When I and the thing come together, one of the two must lose its
[distinct] quality in order that we may become identic.lli. But I am alive, a
willing and truly affirmative agent; the thing, on the other hand, is a
natural entity." It must accordingly perish, and I survive, which is in
general the prerogative and rationale [Venzmi/il of the organic.

organic basis of such products or of any other conditions to which they
are subject.

§ 61
Since the substance o f the thing [Sache] for itself, which is my prop­
erty, is its externality, i.e. its non-substantiality -�e,
it is not an end in itself (see § 42) - and since this realized externality
�nt to which I subject it, it follows that the whole
use or employment of it is the thing in its entirety. Thus, if I have the
whole use of the thing, I am its owner; and beyond the whole extent of
its use, nothing remains of the thing which could be the property of
someone else.

Addition (G). The relation of use to property is the same as that of

substance to accident, inner to outer, or force to its manifestation�
exists onl in so far as it manifests itself; the field is a field only in so far as
it produces a crop.I Thus, he who has the use of a field is the owner of the
whole, and it is an empty abstraction to recognize any further property in
the object [Gegenstam!] itself.2

§ 62
Only my entitlement to a partial or temporary use of something or to
partial or temporary possession of it (a possession in the shape of the
partial or temporary possibility of using it) is therefore to be dis­
tinguished from the ownership of the thing [SadIe] itself. If the whole
extent of the use of a thing were mine, but the abstract ownership
were supposed to be someone else's, the thing as mine would be
wholly penetrated by my will (see the previous paragraph and § 5 2),
while it would at the same time contain something impenetrable by
me, i.e. the will, in fact the empty ,vill, of someone else. As positive
will, I would thus be at the same time objective and not objective to
myself in the thing - a relation of absolute contradiction. - Ownership
is therefore essentiallyfree and complete ownership. I
�

The distinction between the right to the whole extent ofthe use
of a thing and abstract ownership is a product of the empty
understanding, for which the Idea - here as the unity of
ownership, or even of the personal will in general and its

reality is not the truth, but for which these two moments in
their separation from one another count as something true.
This distinction, therefore, as an actual relation, is one of an
empty proprietorship which might be called a madness of
personality (if the term 'madness' were used not just of a
direct contradiction within a person between his merely sub­
jective idea [Vontellwlg] and his actuality), because the term
'mine', as applied to a sillgle object, would have to mean both
my exclusive individual will and another exclusive individual
will, with no mediation between them.2 - In the IlIstitutes,
Book II, Chapter 4, we are told: 'Ususfructus est ius aliellis
rebus utendifruendi salva rerum substa1ltia.' And it is further
stated: 'ne tamen in universum illutiles essent proprietates
semper abscendente usufructu, placuit, certis modis extingui
usumfructum et ad proprietatem reverti.'o 'The law has
decided' - as if an initial preference or decision were needed to
make sense of that empty distinction by a determination of
this kind! A property which suffered 'the pemlalletlt cessation
of usufruct' would not only be 'useless' but no longer a 'prop­
erty' at all. - This is not the place to discuss other distinctions
within property itself, such as those between res ma1lcipi and
lIee mallcipi, domillium QJtiritarium and BOllitarium, and the
like, since they are unconnected with any conceptual
determination of property and are merely historical niceties
associated with this [department of] right.3 But on the one
hand, the distinction discussed above is contained in the rela­
tions of domi1lium directum and domi1lium utile, in the
etllphyteutie contract and the further relations encountered in
estates held in fief with their hereditary rents and other taxes,
payments, feudal tributes, etc. in all their various determina­
tions, where such burdens cannot be redeemed.4 On the other
"'hand, this distinction is not present in so far as domi1lium utile
is associated with burdens as a result of which domi1lium
directu11l becomes at the same time a domi1liu11l utile. If such
°Trallslator's lIote: 'Usufruct is the right to use and enjoy the fruits of allother's property
provided that its substallce is conserved . . . But in order that properties should not
become useless through the pemlalletll cessation of usufruct, the law has decided that,
under certain circumstances, the right of usufruct should be annulled and the use should
revert to the proprietor.'

relations contained nothing other than the above distinction in
its strict abstraction, they would in fact imply not two lords
(domim), but an OW11er on the one hand and a lord over nothing
on the other. But on account of the burdens [on the property],
what we have are two owners in a mutual relationship. Never­
theless, their relationship is not one of comm011 ownership,
although the transition from it to common ownership is very
easy to make. This transition has already begun when, under
dominium directum, the yield of the property is calculated and
treated as its esse1ltial aspect, so that the incalculable aspect of
proprietorship, which has perhaps been thought to lend it
nobility, is subordinated to its usejill [utile] aspect, which in this
case is the rational element.
It must be nearly one and a half millennia since the freedom
ofpers011ality began to flourish under Christianity and became
a universal principle for part - if only a small part - of the
human race.s But it is only since yesterday, so to speak, that
the freedom ofproperty has been recognized here and there as a
principle - an example from world history of the length of
time which the spirit requires in order to progress in its self­
consciousness, and a caution against the impatience of
opinion.

diverse things [Dillge], and it is their common quality which makes them
commensurable. J Thus, the progression of thought here is from the
specific quality of the thing [Sache] to a stage at which this determinate
quality is indifferent, i.e. that of quantity. A similar situation arises in
mathematics. If, for example, I define a circle, an ellipse, or a parabola, it
can be seen that they are specifically different. Nevertheless, the distinc­
tion between these different curves is defined purely quantitatively, that
is, in such a way that the only relevant factor is a quantitative distinction
which relates to their coefficients alone, to their purely empirical dimen­
sions. In the case of prope

�cept of value, the thing [Sache] itself is regarded
merely as a sign, and�ot as itself but as what it is worth. A bill of
exchan
example, does not represent its quality as paper, but is
merely a sign representing another universal, namely value. The value of
a thing can vary greatly in relation [BezieJltlllg] to need; but if one wishes to
express not the specific nature of its value but its value in the abstract, this
is expressed as mOlley. Money can represent anything [aile Dillge], but
since it doesIiOtCfeprct the need itself but is only a sign in place of it, it is
itself governed in tum by the specific value which it merely expresses in
the abstract It is indeed possible to be the owner of a thing [Sache]
without at the same time being the owner of its value. A family which
cannot sell or mortgage its estate is not the proprietor of its value. But
since this form of property is out of keeping with the concept of property,
such limitations [of ownership] (feudal tenancies and entails) are now for
the most part disappearing.

Prescription, therefore, has not been introduced into right

Addition (H). While prescription is an alienation of property without a
Airect declaration on the part of the will, true alienation is a declaration by
the will that I no longer wish to regard the thing as mine. The whole issue
can;JSobe viewed in such a way that alienation is regarded as a true mode
of taking possession. The first moment in property is to take possession of
something immediately; use is a further means of acquiring property; and
the third moment is the unity of the first two, namely taking possession of
something by alienating it.

§ 68
The distinctive" quality of intellectual

[geistiget/]

production may, by

virtue of the way in which it is expressed, be immediately transformed
into the external quality of a thing

[Sache], which may then in tum be

produced by others. In acquiring it, the new owner may thus

appropriate the thoughts which it communicates or the technical
invention which it embodies, and it is this possibility which at times
(as with literary works) constitutes the sole purpose

[Bestimmung]

of

such things and their value as acquisitions; in addition, the new owner
at the same time comes into possession of the universal ways and means
of so expressing himself and of producing a multiplicity of such

things.
In the case of works of art, the form which tangibly represents
the thought in an external medium is, as an object

[Ding], so

distinctive a product of the individual artist that any copy of it
is essentially the product of the intellectual

[geistiget/]

and

technical skill of the copyist. In the case of a literary work, the
form which makes it an external thing

[SadIe],

as with the

invention of a technical device, is ofa mechanical kind. For with
a literary work, the thought is represented not in concrete
depiction but only by a series of discrete and abstract

signs,

and with a technical device, the thought has a completely
mechanical content; and the ways and means of producing
such things

[Sacl/et/], qua

things, belong to the category of

ordinary skills. - Between the extremes of the work of art and
the product of manual craftsmanship there are also transi­
tional stages which share the character of one or other
extreme to a greater or lesser extent.

"Translator's note. Hegel uses the adjective eigentiimlich ('distinctive', 'peculiar'), ell:ploit­
ing its close relationship with the noun Eigentllln ('property', 'ownership') as on several
other occasions in his discussion of property (§ § 41-71). It is not possible to preserve

this fonnal association in English, since the only words which would adequately reflect it
(the adjectives 'proper' and 'own') are rarely suitable as translations of eigentiimlich.

98

Abstract Right
§ 69

�

Since the person who acquires such a product possesses its entire use
and value if he owns a single copy of it, he is the complete and free
owner of it as an individual item. But the author of the book or the
inventor of the technical device remains the owner of the universal
ways and means of reproducing such produ
and means
fu2 e has not immediately alienated these uni
as such but may reserve them for himself as his distinctive mode of

�
versarwayS

The substance of an author's or inventor's right does not
primarily consist in his arbitrarily imposing the condition, on
alienating a single copy of his work, that the power which the
other person thereby acquires to manufacture such products
on his own account as things should not become the other's
property, but should remain that of the inventor. The first
question is whether such a separation between the ownership
of the thing and the power which this confers to produce such
things in turn is an admissible part of the concept, or whether
it does not cancel [azqhebt] full and free ownership (see § 62) so that it depends solely on the arbitrary will of the intellectual
fgeistigt'1l] originator whether he retains the power to
reproduce the things in question, or alienates this power as
something of value, or places no value on it for his own part
and relinquishes it along with the individual thing. For this
power has the peculiar character of being that aspect of a
thing which makes it not merely a possession but a resource
(see below, § § 1 70ff.), so that the latter quality lies in the
particular kind of external use to which the thing is put, and is
distinct and separable from the use to which the thing was
immediately destined. (The use in question is not what is
known as] an accessio naturalis like the procreation of animals
[foetura].) Since, then, this distinction arises \vithin that
which is by nature divisible (that is, within external use), to
retain one part of the use while alienating the other part is not
to reserve a proprietorship without utility [mile]. - The purely
negative, but most basic, means of furthering the sciences and
arts is to protect those who work in them against theft and to

Philosophy ofRight
provide them ,vith security for their property, just as the
earliest and most important means of furthering commerce
and industry was to protect them against highway robbery. Besides, the destiny [Bestimmung] of a product of the intellect
[Geistesprodukt] is to be apprehended by other individuals and
appropriated by their representational thinking, memory,
thought, etc. Hence the mode of expression whereby these
individuals in tum make what they have learned (for learning
means not just memorizing or learning words by heart - the
thoughts of others can be apprehended only by thinking, and
this rethinking is also a kind oflearning) into an alienable thing
will always tend to have some distinctive form, so that they can
regard the resources which flow from it as their property, and
may assert their right to reproduce it. The propagation of the
sciences in general, and the specific business of teaching in
particular, in accordance with its determination and the duty
associated ,vith it (most specifically in the case of the positive
sciences, Church doctrine, jurisprudence, etc.), consist in the
repetition of established thoughts, all of which have already
�
been expressed and acquired from external sources; the same
is true of writings designed for teaching purposes and for the
propagation and dissemination of the sciences. As for the
extent to which the existing store of knowledge, and in par­
ticular the thoughts of other people who retain external
ownership of their intellectual products, become, by virtue of
the newflnn which they acquire through repeated expression,
a special intellectual fgeistiges] property of the individual who
reproduces them and thereby give him (or fail to give him) the
right to make them his external property in tum - the extent to
which this is so cannot be precisely determined, nor therefore
defined in terms of right and the law. The same is true of the
extent to which such repetition in a written publication con­
stitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism ought therefore to be a matter
[Sache] of honour, and honour should deter people from com­
mitting it. - Thus laws against breach o/copyright do attain their
end of protecting the property rights of authors and publishers
to the (albeit very limited) extent specified.2 The ease with
which one can deliberately alter the form of something or
invent an insignificant modification to a major science or to a

comprehensive theory which someone else has created, or
even the impossibility of sticking to the words of the original
author when expounding what one has learned - not to men­
tion the particular ends which necessitate such repetition - in
itself [for sich] introduces that endless multiplicity of alter­
ations which give the property of others the more or less
superficial imprint of being one's own. For example, the hun­
dreds upon hundreds of compendia, excerpts, anthologies,
etc., arithmetic books, geometries, devotional writings, etc.,
show how every new idea [EinfollJ which appears in critical
journals, poetry almanacs, encyclopaedias, etc. can also be
immediately reported under the same or a different title, yet
put forward as the writer's own property. This can easily have
the effect that the profit which the author or inventive
entrepreneur expected from his work or new idea is elimin­
ated, reduced for both parties, or ruined for everyone.a - But
as for the effia ofhonour in preventing plagiarism, it is remark­
able that the expression 'plagiarism', or indeed 'literary theft',
is no longer to be heard these days. This may be because
honour has had its effect in suppressing plagiarism, or
because plagiarism has ceased to be dishonourable and the
revulsion against it has disappeared, or because an insignifi­
cant new idea and a change in outward form are rated so
highly as originality and as the product of independent

Consequently, if the state demands his life, the individual [Individuum]

regard suicide in the first instance as an act of bravery, albeit an inferior
bravery of tailors and maidservants. On the other hand, it can also be seen
as a misfortune, since it is the product of inner_det:��nt. But the
main question is: have I a right to commit suicide? The answer will be

TRANSITION FROM PROPERTY TO CONTRACT

Existence [das Dasein], as determinate being, is essentially being for
another (see above, Remarks to § 48). Property, in view of its
existence as an external thing [Sache], exists for other external things
and within the context of their necess
e
existence of the will, its existence for another can only be for the will of
another person. This relation [Beziehtmg] of will to will is the true
distinctive ground in which freedom has its existence. This mediation
whereby I no longer own property merely by means of a thing and my
subjective will, but also by means of another will, and hence within
the context of a common will , constitutes the sphere or��

to § 45). As far as their own consciousness is concerned, it is
need in general - benevolence, utility, etc. - which leads them
to make contracts; but implicidy [an Sic/I], they are led by
reason, that is,�dea of the real existence of free per­
sonality ('real' in the sense of 'present only within the will') .
Contract presupposes that the contracting parties recognize

This relationship is therefore the mediation of an identical will within
the absolute distinction between owners of proptdlY who have being
for themselves. It contains th; implication thateach party, in
� his own and the other party's will, ceases to be an
owner of property, remains one, and becomes one. This is the mediation
of the will to give up a property (an individual property) and the will to
accept such a property (and hence the property of someone else). The
context of this mediation is one of iden!!!y, in that the one volition
comes to a decision only in so far as the other volition is present.

Since the two contracting parties relate to each other as immediate
self-sufficient persons, it follows that (a) the contract is the product of
the arbitrary will; (�) !he identical will which comes into existence
[Dasein] through the contract is only a will posited ry the cotltracting
parties, hence only a commoll will/ not a ,vill which is universal in and
for itse�jeCt[Gegemtand] of the contract is an illdividual

the state is �ot based on contract, which_P!e§.!:IQposes an arbitrary will. It
is false to say that the arbitrary will of everyone is capable of founding a
state: on the contrary, it is absolutely necessary for each individual to live
within the state. The great advance made by the state in modem times is
that it remains an end in and for itself, and that each individual may no

able goods (see § 66). Furthermore, a stiplllati01 differs from a

contract first through its content, since it refers to a single part
or moment of the whole contract, and secondly, since it is the

formal settlement of the contract (of which more will

be said

later).3 In respect of its content, the stipulation contains only

the formal determination of the contract, the consent of one

party to deliver something and the consent of the other to

Philosophy ofRight
bilateral contracts,4 and other classifications of contracts in
Roman law, are in part superficial groupings based on a single
and often external aspect such as the kind of formalities they
are associated with; and in part they confuse (among other
things) determinations which concern the nature of contract
itself with others which concern only the administration of
justice (aaiOtzes) and the legal [rechtliclzen] consequences of
positive law, and which often derive from wholly external
circumstances and contravene the concept of right.

The distinction between property and possessiont�!!le substantial and
. e�!!cts [of ownershiilisee § 45), becomes, in contract, the
distinction between the common will as agreenzent and its actualization
through��
e:--� een reached, con­
sidered by itself [fUr sich] without reference to its performance, is an
id�a of representational thought rein Vorgestelltes], to which a particu­
'

distinctive manner in which representational thoughts [Vorstellungen]
have their existence in signs (see Encyclopaedia of the Plzilosophical
Sciences, § § 3 79fV This is achieved by expressing the stipulation
through formal gestllres and other symbolic actions, and particularly by
a specific declaration in language, the most appropriate medium [Ele­
metzt] of intellectual representation [der geistigen Vorstellung].
According to this definition [Bestimmung], a stipulation is
indeed the form through which the content of a contract, i.e.
what is concluded in it, has its existence as something as yet
only represented. But this representation is merely a form, and
it does not mean that the content is still subjective in charac­
ter, as something to be wished for or willed in such and such a
way. On the contrary, the content is the decision which the
will finally reaches on such matters.

AdditiOll (H). Just as, in the theory [Lelzre] of property, we had the distinc­

tion between property and possession, between the substantial and the
merely external, so do we have in contract the difference [Dijferenz]
between the common will as agreement and the particular will as per­
formance:It1ieslIl"tlrenature of contract tl1atOot:litfi:eC�nd

the particular will should be expressed, for a contract is a relationship
between one will and another. The agreement, which m�nifusg;j1:Sel(by

The stipulation contains the aspect of will, and hence the substalltial
ele�ento7right in a contract. In contrast to this, the possession which
remains in force so long as the contract is unfulfilled is in itself [fiir
sich] merely the external aspect, which has its determination in the will
alone. Through the stipulation, I have relinquished an item of prop­
erty and my arbitrary will over it, and it has already become the property
of the other party. In terms of right, I am thus immediately bound by
the stipulation to peifoml what has been agreed.
The difference between a mere promise and a contract lies in
the fact that, in a promise, whatever I intend to give, do, or
perform is expressed as somethillg ill the fitture, and �
remains a subjeaive determination of my will, which I can
therefore subsequendy alter. The stipulation in a contract, on
the other hand, is itself already the existe1lce [Daseill] of my"
will's decision, illthe sense that I have thereby alienated the
�g [Sache] I own, that it has 11;;; ceased to be my property,
and that I already' rwlgnlzeliasili:e property of the other
party. The Roman distinction between paaum and c011traaus is
a bad one.] - Fichte once maintained that my obligation to
observe a contract comme1lces orily when the other party begins
to perform [his side of the agreement], for until he does so, I
do not know whether his original utterance was seriously
meallt; the obligation before the performance could therefore
orily be of a moral nature, rather than based on righe But the
utterance of a stipulation is not just an utterance in general;
on the contrary, it embodies the commoll will which has come
into being, and which has superseded the arbitrariness of
[individual] dispositioll and its liability to change. It is not
1 09

T
Philosophy ofRight
therefore a question of whether the other party's attitude may
have differed inwardly, or subsequently become different, but
of whether he has any right to such different attitudes. Even if
the other party begins to perform [his side of the agreement], I
likewise retain the arbitrary will which enables me to do
wrong. The nullity of Fichte's view is at once apparent from
the fact that it would base contractual rights on the false
infinite/ on an infinite regress, on the infinite divisibility of
time, matter, action, etc. The ex1stet/ce which the will has in the
formality of gesture or in language which is determinate for
itself is already the complete existence of the will, as intellec­
tual [intellektuellet/] will, and the performance [of the agree­
ment] is merely its selfless consequence. - The fact that there
are also, in positive right, so-called real contracts as distinct
from so-called COt/set/sual contracts - in the sense that the
former are considered as fully valid only after the consent has
been followed by the actual performance (res, traditio ret) - is
of no consequence here.4 For on the one hand, the former are
particular cases where it is only this transfer [of goods] which
enables me to perform my side [of the agreement], and where
my obligation to perform it refers to the thing in question only
in so far as it has come into my hands, as with loans, contracts
of lease, and deposits (and as may be the case with other
contracts, too) - a circumstance which concerns not the
nature of the relationship between stipulation and perform­
ance, but the manner of performance itself. And on the other
hand, the arbitrary will is always at liberty to stipulate in a
contract that the obligation of the one party to perform [his
side of the agreement] should not lie in the contract itself as
such, but should depend on the other party performing his
side first.

between ��g [Sache]. They accordingly give
rise to the following kinds of contract (the classification given here
coincides on the whole with that of Kant's Metaphysical Elemmts ofthe
Theory of Right [Metaphysische Anfangsgriinde der Reclztslehre], pp.
1 2off./ and one might have expected that the old humdrum classi­
fication of contracts as real and consensual, named and unnamed, etc.
would long since have been abandoned in favour of a rational
classification):
A. Contract ofgift, comprising
I . Gift of a thing; so-called gift in the proper sense.
2. ---Loan of a thing,
i.e. the giving away ofpart of it or of the limited
-e1zjoymmt and use of it; the lender here remains the owner of the
thing (mutuum and commodatum without payment of interest).2
The thing in this case is either a specific thing, or it may, even if
it is a specific thing, nevertheless be regarded as universal, or it
counts (like money) as a thing universal in itselfJ/iir sich].
3 . Gift of a seroice of any kind, 3e.g. the mere safe-keeping of an
item of property (depositum). Testammtary disposition, i.e. the
gift of a thing with the particular condition that the other party
should not become the owner until the time ofthe donor's death
(at which time the latter in any case ceases to be the owner),
has no place in the concept of contract, but presupposes civil
society and a positive legislation.
-

B. Contract ofexchange
1 . Exchange as such:
(a) of a thing of any kind, i.e. of a specific thing for another of
4
the same kind.
(�) purchase or sale (etntio, vmditio); exchange of a specific thing
for one designated [bestimmt] as universal and which counts
only as value, without the other specific determination of
utility - i.e. for money.
2. Letting or hiring (locatio, conductio); alienation of the tetnporary
use of a property in exchange for rmt, viz.
(a) of a specific thing, letting in the proper sense, or
(�) of a universal thing, so that the lender remains only the
owner of this universal, or in other words of the value - loan
(mutuum, or commodatum, if a rent is payable).s The further
empirical characteristics of the thing (whether it be a stick,

implement, house, etc., res fungibilis or non fungibilis) give
rise to other particular determinations (as in A.z. above,
loan as gift), but these are7of no importance."
Wages co11tracf (locatio operae); alienation of my output [Pro­
duziere1ls] or services (Le. in so far as these are alienable) for a
limited time or with some other limiting condition (see § 67).

Akin to this are matldates and other contracts whose performance
depends on character and trust or on superior talents, and where
an incommensurability arises between the performance and its
external value (which in this case is not described as wages, but as
an honorarirt11l).

C . Completi01l of a co11tract (cautio) by giving a pledge
In those contracts whereby I alienate the use [Benutzrmg] of a
thing, I am no longer in possession of it but am still its owner (as
when I rent something out). Furthermore, in contracts of
exchange, sale, and gift, I may have become the owner of some­
thing without yet being in possession of it, and the same disjunc­
8 which does not follow
tion arises with regard to any performance
step by step. Now the effect of the pledge is that in the one case I
remain, and in the other case I come into, actual possession of the
value as that which is still, or has already become, my property,
without being in possession of the specific thing which I am hand­
ing over or which I am to receive. The pledge is a specific thing,
but it is my property only to the extent of the value of the property
which I have handed over into someone else's possession or which
is due to me. But as far as its specific character and any excess
value it may have are concerned, it remains the property of the
person giving the pledge. Consequently, giving a pledge is not
itself a contract but only a stipulation (see § 77), Le. the moment
which completes a contract with regard to the possession of a
property. Mortgage and surety are particular forms of pledge.
-

Additioll (H). In the case of contract, we made the following distinction:

while I become the owner of an item of property through the agreement
(stipulation), I do not yet have possession of it but gain possession only
��rmance. Now if I already have full ownership of the

"Translator's note: Hegel's manuscript note adds the gloss 'i.e. of no importance for the

universal determinations'.

thing, the purpose of the pledge is that I should at the same time gain
possession of the value of the property, and that the performance should
thereby be guaranteed within the agreement itself. Surety is a particular
kind of pledge whereby someone tenders his promise or his credit as a
guarantee of my performance. Here, a person assumes the role which, in
the case of a pledge, is fulfille d by a mere thing.

its performance; but this again is a matter [Sache] for the particular will,
which may, as such, act in contravention of that right which has being in
itself. Thus, there appears at this point the negation which was already

§ 82
In contract, right in

universality is present as a common actor in the arbitrariness and
particul§" wills of those concern� This appearance of right, in which
right itself and its essential existetlCe [Dasein], the particular will,
coincide immediately - i.e. in a contingent manner - goes on, in the
case of wrong, to become �e - an opposition between right in
itself and the particular will as that in which right becomes a partiadar
right. But the truth of this semblance is that it is null and void, and
that right re-establishes itself by negating iJ.ilSnegation of itself. J
Through this proces;-Qf mediation whereby right returns to itself
-fr� TtSnegation, it determines itself as actual and valid, whereas it
wasat first only il1 itself and something immediate.

----

Additioll (H). Right in itself, the universal will, is essentially determined by
the particulafWiIr,alld thus stands in relation [BeziehUllg] to something
inessential. This is the relationship [Verlziiltllis] of the essence to its

appearance. Even if the appearance is in conformity with the essence, it is
not in conformity with it from another point ofview, for appearance is the
stage of contingency, or essence in relation [Bezielztwg] to the inessential.
But in the case of wrong, appearance goes on to become a semblance. A
semblance is existence inappropriate to the essence, the empty detach­
ment and positedness of the essence, so that in both [semblance and
essence], their distinctness is [mere] difference. Semblance is therefore
the untruth which disappears because it seeks to exist for itself, and in this
disappearance, essence has shown itself as essence, that is, as the power
over semblance. The essence has negated its own negation, and is thereby
1 15

Philosophy ofRight
confirmed. Wrong is a semblance of this kind, and through its disap­
pearance, right acquires the determination of something fixed and valid.
What we have just referred to as essence is right in itself, in contrast to
which the particular will is superseded [sidl allfllebt] as untrue. Whereas
right previously had only an immediate being, it now becomes actllal as it
returns out of its negation; for actuality is that which is effective" and
sustains itself in its otherness, whereas the immediate still remains liable
to negation.

relationship with the verb wirketl ('to be effective').

Right, as something particttlar and therefore complex in contrast to
the universality and simplicity ofits being itl itself, acguires the form of
a sembla1lce. It is this semblance either ill itselfor In;mediately, or it is

§§ 82-86

A. Unintentional Wrong
Taking possession (see § 54) and contract, for themselves and in their
particular varieties, are in the first place different expressions and
consequences of my will in general; but since the will is inherendy [in
sich] universal, they are also legal claims [Redztsgriillde] in respect of
their recognition by others. By virtue of their multiplicity and mutual
externality, they may be entertained by different persons with
reference to one and the same thing [Sadie], and each of these per­
sons, on the strength of his particular claim, may regard the thing as
his property. This gives rise to collisiOllS of rights.

§ 85
Such a collision, in which a legal claim is made to a thing [Sache], and
which constitutes the sphere of civil aaions, involves the recognition of
right as the universal and deciding factor, so that the thing may belong
to the person who has a right to it. The action concerns merely the
subslwlption of the thing under the property of the one or the other
party - a completely negative judgement whereby, in the predicate
'mine', only the particular is negated.

§ 86
For the parties involved, the recognition of right is bound up with
their particular opposing interests and points of view. In opposition to
this semblance/ yet at the same time withill the semblance itself (see
§ 85), right in itselfemerges as something represented [vorgestellt] and
required. But it appears at first only as an obligation, because the will is
not yet present as a will which has freed itself from the immediacy of
interest in such a way that, as a particular will, it has the universal will
as its end. Nor is it here determined as a recognized actuality of such
a kind that, when confronted with it, the parties would have to
renounce their particular points of view and interests.

B. Deception

Right in itself, as distinct from right as particular and existent, is
indeed, as a requiremrot, determined as the essential; but as such, it is
at the same time only a requirement and in this respect merely subjec­
tive, hence inessential and a mere semblance. When the universal is

case of contract, is reduced in the first place to a purely external

(H). The particular will is respected at this second level of
wrong, but universal right is not. In deception; the particular Will is not
infringed, because the deceived person is given the illusion that he is
receiving his right. Thus, the right which is required is posited as some­
thing subjective, a mere sem�lance, and this constitutt;!s deception.

That the objective or universal element, as opposed to this acceptance
of the thing [Sache] merely as this thi1lg and to the mere opinions and
arbitrariness of the will, should be recognizable as value and have
validity as right, and that the subjective arbitrary will in its opposition
to right should be superseded, is again in the first instance only a
requirement.

Additioll (H). No penalty attaches to civil and unintentional wrong, for in

such cases I have ,villed nothing contrary to right. In the case of decep­
tion, however, penalties are introduced, because it is now a matter of
infringements of right.

C. Coercion and Crime

§ 90

When I own property, my will is embodied in an external thi1lg [Sache].
This means that my will , to the extent that it is reflected in the
external thing, is also caught up in it and subjected to necessity. In
this situation, it may either experience force in general, or it may be
'
forced to sacrifice or do something as a condition of retaining some
possession ' or' positive bemg, thereby s�ftering coercio1l.
,

Additiotl (H). Wrong in the proper sense is crime, where neither right in

itself nor [right] as it appears to me is respected - that is, where both
sides, objective and subjective, are infringed. ::oJ/'

Special attention must be paid here to the distinction
between right and morality. In the moral sphere - that is, when I am

the Idea by which I should determine myself. The existence of the good is
my decision, and I actualize it within myself; but this existence is wholly
inward, so that coercion cannot be applied to it. Thus, the laws of the
state cannot claim to extend to a person's disposition, for in the moral
sphere, I exist [only] for myself, and force is meaningless in this context.

Right, whose infringement is crime, has admittedly appeared
up till now only in those shapes which we have considered;
hence crime likewise, for the moment, has only the more
specific meaning associated with these determinations. But
the substantial element within these forms is the universal,
which remains the same in its further development and in the
further shapes it assumes; thus its infringement, i.e. crime,
also remains the same, in conformity with its concept. Hence
the determination which will be considered in the following
paragraph also applies to the particular and further
determined content [of crime], e.g. in perjury, treason, coun­
terfeiting, forgery, etc.

§ 96

It is only the existetlt will which can be infringed. But in its existence
[Daseill], the will enters the sphere of quantitative extension and
qualitative determinations, and therefore varies accordingly. Thus, it
likewise makes a difference to the objective side of crime whether the
will's existence and determinacy in general is infringed throughout its

entire extent, and hence frl1I1aflity

The Stoic view that there is only olle virtue and olle vice,! the
laws of Drac02 which punish every crime with death, and the
barbarous code of formal honour which regards every
infringement as an offence against the infinite personality, all
have this in common: they go no further than the abstract
. thought of the free will an personality, and do not consider
the1afCei'in�ate existence which it
must have as Idea. - The distinction between robbery and theft
is a qualitative one ; for in the case of robbery, [my] 'I' is also

infringed as present consciousness and hence as this subjective

tative determinations [of crime], such as danger to public
security, have their basis in more precisely determined circum­

stances, but they are often apprehended only indirectly in the
light of other consequences rather than in terms of the con­
cept of the thing [Sache]. Thus, the crime which is more
dangerous in itself [{ziT sich], in its immediate character, is a
more serious infringement in its extent or quality. - The
subjective, moral quality [of a crime] relates to the higher
distinction regarding the extent to which an event or deed is in
any sense an action, and concerns the latter's subjective
nature itself (which will be discussed later).

Additi01l (H). Thought cannot specify how each crime should be

punished; positive determinations are necessary for this purpose. With
the progress of education, however, attitudes toward crime become more
\lenient" and punishments today are not nearly so harsh as they were a
hundred years agu� It is not the crimes or punishments themselves which
change, but the relation between the two.
--------

When an infringement of right as right occurs, it does have a positive
external existence [Existenz], but this existence within itself
is null and

infringement likewise comes into existeI!.ce; this is the actuality of
right, as its necessity whlch mediates itself with itself through the
cancellation [Aujlzebzmg] of its infringement.

Additi01l (H). Through a crime, something is altered, and the thing [Sac/Ie]

exists in this alteration; but this existence is the opposite of the thing itself,
and is to that extent within itself [i1l siclz] null and void. The nullity is [the
presumption] that right as right has been cancelled [aujgelzoben]. For right,
as an absolute, cannot be cancelled, so that the expression of crime is
within itself null and void, and this nullity is the essence of the effect of
crime. But whatever is null and void must manifest itself as such - that is,
it must itself appear as vulnerable. The criminal act is not an initial
positive occurrence followed by the punishment as its negation, �
itself negative, so that the unishment is merel the negation of the

superficial points of view, however, the objective considera­
tion of justice, which is the primary and substantial point of
view in relation to crime, is set aside; it automatically follows
that the essential consideration is now the moral point of view,
i.e. the subjective aspect of crime, intermixed with trivial
psychological ideas [Vorstellzmgen] of stimuli and the strength
of sensuous motives [Triebftdem] as opposed to reason, of
psychological coercion and of psychological influences on
representational thought [die Vorstellzmg] (as if such influences
were not themselves reduced by freedom to something purely
contingent). The various considerations which are relevant to
punishment as a phenomenon [Ersclzeimmg] and to its relation
[Bezielzung] to the particular consciousness, and which con­
cern its effect on representational thought (as a deterrent,
corrective, etc.), are of essential significance in their proper
context, though primarily only in connection with the modality
ofpunishment. ����in

It is well known that Beccaria] questioned the right of the
state to impose capital punishment, on the grounds that it
could not be presumed that the social contract included the
consent of individuals [Individuen] to allow themselves to be
killed, and that we ought rather to assume the contrary. But
the state is by no means a contract (see § 75), and its subs'Gtltial essence does not consist unconditionally in the protection
and saftguarding of the lives and property of individuals as
such. The state is rather that higher instance which may eve

existence [Existenz] of justice is concerned, the fonu which it
has within the state, namely that of punishment, is not its only
fonu, and the state is not a necessary condition of justice in
itself.

Addition (H,G). Beccaria is quite right to demand that human beings

should give their consent to being punished, but the criminal gives this
consent by his very act. Both the nature of crime and the criminal's own
will require that the infringement for which he is responsible should be
cancelled [arifirehoben]. Nevertheless, Beccaria's efforts to have capital
punishment abolished [arifheben ZII lassen] have had advantageous effects.
Even if neither Joseph II nor the French have ever managed to secure its
complete abolition/ people have begun to appreciate which crimes
deserve the death penalty and which do not. The death penalty has
consequently become less frequent, as indeed this ultimate fonu of
punishment deserves to be.3

It is usual in science for a determination - in this case, that of
punishment - to be defined in tenus of the universal repreSetl­
tations [VorstelItwg] of conscious psychological experience. In
the present case, this experience would indicate that the
universal feeling of peoples and individuals towards crime is,

other occasions accept propositions which contradict such so­
called universal fods of consciousness. - But the determina­
tion of equality has brought a major difficulty into the idea
[Vorstelltl1lg] of retribution, although the justice (in tenus of

their qualitative and quantitative character) of whatever
punishments are determined is in any case a matter which
arises later than the substance of the thing [Sache] itself. Even
if, for this later determination of punishments, we had to look
around for principles other than those which apply to the
universal aspect of punishment, this universal aspect remains
what it is. Yet the concept itself must always contain the basic
principle, even for the particular instance. This determination
of the concept, however, is precisely that necessary connec­
tion [which dictates] that crime, as the will which is null and
void in itself, accordingly contains within itself its own nullifi­
cation, and this appears in the form of punishment. It is this
inner identity which, for the understanding, is reflected in

realm offillite t!zillgs, the absolute determination remains only a

i-I!

requirement, on which the understanding must impose
increasing restrictions - and this is of the utmost importance but which continues ad infinitum and admits in perpetuity of
only an approximate fulfilment. - If we not only overlook this
nature of the finite realm but also proceed no further than
abstract and specific equality, an insuperable difficulty arises
when we come to determine punishments (especially if
psychology also invokes the strength of sensuous motives
[Triebftdem] and, as a corollary, either the correspondingly
greater strength of the evil will or - ifwe preftr - the correspond­
i11gly lesser strength and freedom of the will in general). Fur­
thermore, it is very easy to portray the retributive aspect of
punishment as an absurdity (theft as retribution for theft,
robbery for robbery, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth/
so that one can even imagine the miscreant as one-eyed or
toothless); but the conce t has nothin to do with this
.absw:.dity, f� which the introduction of that [idea of] specific
equality is alone to blame. Value, as the inner equality of things
[Sachell] which, in their existence [Existenz], are specifically
quite different, is a determination which has already arisen in
connection with contracts (see [§ 77] above) and with civil

suits against crimes (see § 9 8)," and which raises our
representation [Vorstelltmg] of a thing above its immediate
character to the universal. In the case of crime, whose basic
detennination is the infinite aspect of the deed, that aspect
which is only externally specific disappears all the more
readily, and equality remains merely the basic measure of the
criminal's essetztial deserts, but not of the specific external
shape which the retribution should take. It is only in terms of
this specific shape that theft and robbery [on the one hand]
and fines and imprisonment etc. [on the other] are completely
unequal, whereas in terms of their value, i.e. their universal
character as injuries [Verletzungetz], they are comparable. It is
then, as already remarked, a matter [Sache] for the under­
standing to seek an approximate equivalence in this common
value. If we do not grasp either the connection, as it is in itself,
between crime and its nullification, or the thought of value
and the comparability of crime and punishment in terms of
value, we may reach the point (see Klein's Elemetzts ofPenal
Law, § 9)2 of regarding a proper punishment as a purely arbi­
trary association of an evil [eines Ube/s1 with an illicit action.

Additioll (H). Retribution is the inner connection and the identity of two

determinatig.ns which are different in appearance and a so have a dif­
ferent external existence [Existetzz] in relation to one another. When the
criminal meets with retribution, this has the appearance of an alien
destiny [Bestimmtmg] which does not belong to him; yet as we have seen,
the punishment is merely a manifestation of the crime, i.e. it is one half
which is necessarily presupposed by the other. What is at first sight
objectionable about retribution is that it looks like something inunoral,
like revenge, and rna thus be interpreted as a personal matter. Yet it is
not the personal element, but e concept itsel which carries out retribu­
tion. 'Vengeance is mine' is the word of God in the Bible,J and It the wora
.---retribution should evoke the idea [Vorstelltmg] of a particular caprice of the

inadequate inasmuch as it is the action of a subjective will, and thus out of

persons, but their will is the universal will of the law, and they do not seek
to include in the punishment anything but what is naturally present in the

To require that this contradiction, which in the present case is to be
found in the manner in which wrong is cancelled [derArt und Weise des
Aztjhebens], should be resolved in the same way as contradictions in
other kinds of wrong (see § § 86 and 89), is to require a justice freed
from subjective interest and subjective shape and from the con­
tingency of power - that is, a punitive rather than an avenging justice
Primarily, this constitutes a requirement for a will which, as a particu­
lar and subjective will, also wills the universal as such. But this concept
of morality is not just a requirement; it has emerged in the course of
this movement itself.

§ 1 08
The subjective will, as immediate for itself and distinct from that
which has being in itself (see Remarks to § 1 06), is therefore abstract,
circumscribed [beschra1lkt], and formal. But not only is subjectivity
[itself] formal; as the infinite self-determination of the will, it also
constitutes thefomw/ aspect of the will [in general]. When it ma�
fust appearance in the individual [ei1lzel1le1l] ,vill, it has not yet been
posited as identical with the concept of the will, so !h.at the moral
point of view is consequently the point of view of relatio1lship, oblilJ!!:::
_,-or requireme1lt. - And since the difference [D"@re1lz] of suhjec"'"
tivity likewise contains the determination whereby it is opposed to
objectivity as external existence [Dasei1l], we also encounter here the
point of view of consciousness (see § 8) - in general, the point of view of
the difference, ji---;itude, and appearatlCe of the will .
The moral is not primarily defined [bestimmt] simply as the
opposite of immoral, just as right is not in an immediate sense
the opposite of wrong. On the contrary, the universal point of
view of the moral and the immoral alike is based on the
subjectivity of the will.

Additioll (H).

In morality, self-determination should be thought of as
sheer restless activity which cannot yet arrive at something that is. Only in
�es the will become identical with the concept of the
will and have the latter alone as its content. In the moral sphere, the will
still relates to that which has being in itselfiJ!.is thus the point of view of
Il{JJeieiice, and me process associated with it is that whereby the subjective
'wiIlaChleves identity with its concept. The obligation which is therefore
still present in morality is fulfilled only in the ethical realm. In addition,
this 'other' to which the subjective will stands in relation is twofold: first,
it is the substantial element of the concept, and secondly, it is that which
exists externally. Even if the good were posited in the subjective will, this
would not yet amount to its implementation.

In accordance with its universal determination, this formal aspect [of
the will] contains in the first place the opposition between subjectivity
and objectivity and the activity associated with this opposition (see
§ 8). More precisely, its moments are as follows:�d
.!!temzJ3zcy are identic��t (cf. § I 04),,� the will as
subjective �t. The two sides [Le. subjectivity and
ObjectiVitY] must be distinguished - each as independent [fiir sich] and

��

( ferences of form.

I

§ l ID
But this identity of content receives its more precise and distinctive
determination within the moral point of view, in which freedom, this
identity of the will with itself, is present for the will (see § 105 ).
-�---�

(a) The content is determined for me as mine in such a way that, in its
identity, it contains my subjectivity for me not only as my inner end, but
also in so far as this end has achieved extemal objectivity.

Addition (H).

The content of the subjective or moral will contains a
determination of its own: even if it has attained the form of objectivity, it
should nevertheless still contain my subjectivity, and my act should be
recognized only in so far as it was inwardly determined by me as my
purpose and intention. Only what was already present in my subjective
will do I recognize as mine in that will's expression, and I expect to re­
encounter my subjective consciousness in it.

§§ 109-1 12

(b) Although the content does include something particular - regard­
less of where this may have come from it nevertheless embodies, as
the content of the will reflected illto itselfin its determina9', and hence
of the self-identical and universal will, (a) e inner determination of
�
being in conformity with the will which has being in itself, or of
possessing the o�jgJiJ1iJY-J!f-.!�t; but (�) because the subjective
will, in so far as it has being for itself, is at the same time still formal
(see § 1 08), this is only a requiremerzt, and it still includes the possi­
bility of [the content] not being in conformity with the concept.

§ I I2
(c) While I preserve my subjectivity in implementing my ends (see
§ l IO), in the course of thus objectifYing them I at the same time
supersede this subjectivity in its immediacy, and hence in its character
as my individual subjectivity. But the external subjectivity which is
thus identical with me is the will of others (see § 73). - The basis of
the will's existerzce [Existerzz] is now subjectivity (see § 1 06), and the will
of others is the existence [Existerzz] which I give to my end, and which
is for me at the same time an other. - The implementation of my end
therefore has this identity of my will and the will of others within it - it
has a positive reference to the will of others.
The objectivity of the end, once it is implemented, therefore
encompasses three meanings - or rather it contains as a unity
the following three moments: it is (a) extemal immediate
existence [Daseill] (see § 1 09), (m in conformity with the C011cept (see § I 1 2), and (y) ulliversal subjectivity. The subjectivity
which is preserved in this objectivity is such that (a)�
the objective end is my end, so that I am preserved in it as this
mdlvidual(see § 1 10); moments (�) and (y) of subjectivity
coincide with moments (�) and (y) of objectivity (see above). That these determinations, which from the point of view of
morality are distinct from one another, are thus united only as
a c01ltradictioll constitutes more precisely the fillitude of this
sphere, or its character as appearallce (see § 1 08); and the
development of this point of view is the development of these
139

Philosophy ofRight
contradictions and their resolutions (although such resolu­
tions, within this sphere, can only be relative).

Addition (H). In connection with formal right, we noted that it contained
, �s, and that an action strictly in keeping with right conse­
quently had a purely negative determination in respect of the will of
others. In morality, on the other hand, the determination of my will with
reference to the will of others is positive - that is, the will which has being
m itself is inwardly present in w at the subjective will realizes. This
entails the production or alteration of something existent, which in tum
has reference to the will of others. The concept of morality is the will's
inner attitude [Verhalten] towards itself. But not just one will is present
here. On the contrary, its objectivization also contains the determination
whereby the individual will within it is superseded; and in consequence,
since the determination of one-sidedness disappears, two wills with a
positive reference to one another are now posited. In the context of right,
any intentions which the will of others may have with reference to my will,
which gives itself existence [Dasei1l] in property, are irrelevant. In the
moral sphere,��, the welfare of others is also involved an�y
at this point that this positive reference can come into play.

Furthermore, action has multiple

consequences in so far as it is
[Dasein] ; for the latter, by virtue of

its context in external necessity, develops in all directions. These
consequences,

as

the [outward]

shape whose soul is the end to which

the action is directed, belong to the action as an integral part of it. But
the action, as the end translated into the

external world, is at the same

time exposed to external forces which attach to it things quite dif­
ferent from what it is for itself, and impel it on into remote and alien
consequences. The will thus has the right

to accept responsibility only

for the first set of consequences, since they alone were part of its

purpose.
The distinction between

co1Ztingent and necessary consequences

is indeterminate inasmuch as inner necessity comes into
existence in the finite realm as

extenzal necessity, as a relation­
[Dingetz] which, as self-suf­

ship between individual things

ficient entities, come together in mutual indifference and in
an external manner. The maxim

[Grundsatz] which enjoins us

to disregard the consequences of our actions, and the other
which enjoins us to judge actions by their consequences and
make the latter the yardstick of what is right and good, are in
equal measure [products of the] abstract understanding. In so
far as the consequences are the proper and

immanetzt shape of

the action, they manifest only its nature and are nothing other
than the action itself; for this reason, the action cannot
repudiate or disregard them. I But conversely, the conse­
quences also include external interventions and contingent
additions which have nothing to do with the nature of the
action itself. - The development in the realm of existence of
the contradiction which is contained in the

necessit)1 ofthefinite

is simply the transformation of necessity into contingency and
vice versa. From this point of view, to act therefore means to
submit oneselJto this law. - It follows from this that the criminal
stands to benefit if his action has less adverse consequences,
just as the good action must accept that it may have no conse­
quences or relatively few; and it also follows that, once the
consequences of a crime have developed more fully, the crime

itself is made responsible for them. - The heroic self-con­
sciousness (as in ancient tragedies like that of Oedipus) has
not yet progressed from its unalloyed simplicity to reflect on
the distinction between deed and aaion, between the external
event and the purpose and knowledge of the circumstances, or
to analyse the consequences minutely, but accepts responsi­

Intention and Welfare

§ I I9
The external existence [Dasein] of an action is a varied set of connec­
tions which may be regarded as infinitely divided into individual units
[Einzelheitm], and the action itself can be thought of as having touched
only one ofthese units in thefirst instance. But the truth of the individual
[des Einze/nm] is the universal, and the determinate character of the
action for itself is not an isolated content confined to one external
unit, but a mziversal content containing within itself all its various
connections. The purpose, as emanating from a thinking agent, con­
tains not just the individual uni�Outessentially that universal aspea
already referred to - the intmtion.
[The word for] inte1ltion contains in its etymology [the idea of]
abstraaion,·
either as the form of universality or as the selection
'
otap;;;:i[cular aspect of the concrete thing [Sache]. To attempt
to justifY something in terms of its intention is to isolate an
individual aspect completely and to maintain that it is the
subjective essence of the action. - To judge an action as an
-external deed without first determining whether it is right or
wrong is to apply a universal predicate to it, classifYing it as
arson, murder, or the like. - By its determination, external
actuality consists of individual units, which shows that external
conneaions are inherent in its nature. Actuality is touched in

It is certainly the case that a greater or lesser number of
circumstances may intervene in the course of an action. In a case of arson,
for example, the fire may not take hold, or conversely, it may spread
further than the culprit intended. Nevertheless, no distinction should be
made here between good and ill fortune, for in their actions, human
beings are necessarily involved in externality. An old proverb rightly says,
'The stone belongs to the devil when it leaves the hand that threw itY By

§ I 20
The right of illfC1lti01l is that the u1liversal quality of the action shall
have being not only i1l itself, but shall be Jmow1l by the agent and thus
have been present all along in his subjective will; and conversely, what
we may call the right of the objectivity of the action is the right of the
action to assert itself as known and ,villed by the subject as a thi1lki1lg

agC1lt.
The right to such insight implies that the respo1lsibility of
children, imbeciles, lunatics, etc. for their actions is either
totally absC1lt or diminished. - But just as actions, in their

in relation to the externality of my action. My end constitutes the
determining content of the action. Murder and arson, for example, as
universals, do not constitute my positive content as a subject. If someone
has perpetrated crimes of this kind, we ask why he committed them. The
murder was not committed for the sake of murder; on the contrary, some
particular positive end was also present. If we were to say, however, that
the murder was committed for the pleasure of killing, then this pleasure
would itself be the positive content of the subject as such, and the deed
would then be tile satisfaction of the subject's volition. Thus the motive
71JeWeggmndj of a deed IS more precIsely what we call the moral element,
and this, in the present context, has two meanings - the universal which is
inherent in the purpose, and the particular aspect of the intention. In
recent times especially, it has become customary to enquire about the
motives of actions, although the question used simply to be 'Is this man
honest [rechtscllaffen]? Does he do his duty?' Now, we seek to look into
people's hearts, and thereby presuppose a gulf between the objective
realm of actions and the inner, subjective realm of motives. The

1 49

Philosophy ofRight
determination of the subject must certainly be considered: it wills some­
thing whose ground lies within the subject itself; it wills the fulfilment of
its desire and the gratification of its passion. But the good and the right
are also a content - not just a natural content, but a content posited by my
rationality; and to make my freedom the content of my will is a pure
determination of my freedom itself. The higher moral viewpoint therefore
consists in finding satisfaction in one's action, not in stopping short at the
gulf between the self-consciousness of the human being and the objec­
tivity of the deed - although the latter attitude does predominate in
certain periods of world history and of the lives of individuals.

§ I22
This particular aspect gives the action its subjective value and interest
for me. In contrast with this end - i.e. the i7ltentionfrom the point ofview
of its content - the immediate character of the action in its further
content is reduced to a means. In so far as such an end is a 6nite one,
it may in tum be reduced to a means to some further intention, and so
on in an infinite progression.

§ I 23

For the content of these ends, all that presents itself here is (a) formal
activity itself, inasmuch as the subject actively commits itself to
whatever it is to regard and promote as its end - for human beings
wish to act in support of whatever interests them, or should interest
them, as their own. (�) But the as yet abstract and formal freedom of
subjectivity has a more determinate content only in its natural subjec­
tive existence [Dasein] - its needs, inclinations, passions, opinions,
fancies, etc. The satisfaction of this content is welfore or happiness,
both in its particular determinations and in its universal aspect - the
ends of finitude in general.
This is the point of view of relationship (see § 1 08), where the
subject is determined in its differentiation and so counts as
something particular, and where the content of the natural will
makes its appearance (see § I I). But the will here is not as it is
in its immediacy; instead, this content, belonging as it does to
the will reflected into itself, is raised to a universal end, namely
that of welfore or happiness (see Encyclopaedia ofthe Philosophical

I S°

Morality

§§ 1 21-1 24

Sciences, § § 3 9SffV This is the point ofview of thought which
does not yet comprehend the will in its freedom, but reflects on
its content as something natural and given - as, for example,

�SOIOrl.�/

Addition (H). In so far as the determinations of happiness are present and
given, they are not true determinations of freedom, which is not truly
present for itselfuntil it has adopted the good as an end in itself. We may
ask at this point whether the human being has a right to set himself ends
which are not based on freedom, but solely on the fact that the subject is a
living being. The fact that he is a living being is not contingent, however,
but in accordance with reason, and to that extent he has a right to make
his needs his end. There is nothing degrading about being alive, and we
do not have the alternative of existing in a higher spirituality. It is only by
raising what is present and given to a self-creating process that the higher
sphere of the good is attained (although this distinction does not imply
that the two aspects are incompatible).

§ 1 24
Since the subjective satisfaction of the individual himself (including his
recognition in the shape of honour and fame) is also to be found in the
implementation of ends which are valid in and for themselves, it is an
empty assertion of the abstract understanding to require that only an
end of this kind shall appear willed and attained, and likewise to take
the view that, in volition, objective and subjective ends are mutually
exclusive. Indeed, such attitudes become even worse if they lead to
the assertion that, because subjective satisfaction is present (as it
always is when a task is completed), it constitutes the agent's essential
intention to which the objective end was merely a means. - What the
subject is, is the series of its actions. If these are a series of worthless
productions, then the subjectivity ofvolition is likewise worthless; and
conversely, if the series of the individual's !leeds are of a substantial
nature, then so also is his inner willJ
The right of the subject's particularity to find satisfaction, or to put it differendy - the right of subjective freedom, is the
pivotal and focal point in the difference between antiquity and
the modem-age. This right, in its infinity, is expressed in
c::hnstianity, andlt has become the universar-and actual

of actions those inclinations and pas­

sions which were simultaneously satisfied by substantial
activity, along with fame and honour and other consequences
- indeed that whole particular aspect which it had declared in
advance to be inherently inferior. The same attitude assures
us that, since great actions and the activity associated with a
series of these have accomplished great things in the world
and have consequently brought power, honour, and fame to
the

itzdividual agerzt, it is not the greatness itself which belongs

to the individual, but only those particular and external conse­

likewise subjective - and

overlooks the substantial element in

Subjectivity, with its particztlar content of weffore, is reflected into itself
and infinite, and consequently also has reference to the universal, to
the will which has being in itself. This [universal] moment, initially
posited within this particularity itself, includes the weffore oJotl!..e. rs - or
in its complete, but wholly empty determination, the welfare of al/.
The welfare of many other particular beings in general is thus also an
essential end and right of subjectivity. But since the universal which
has beitlg in and for itself, as distinct from such particular [kinds of]
content, has not so far ,been determined beyond the stage of right,
these ends of particularity, different as they are from the universal,
may be in conformity with it - but alternatively, they may not.

My particularity, however, like that of others, is only a right at all in so
far as I amfree. It cannot therefore assert itself in contradiction to this
substantial basis on which it rests; and an intention to promote my
welfare and that of others - and in the latter case in particular it is
called a moral i1ltention cannot justifY an action which is wrmlg.
-

One of the most conspicuous among the corrupt maxims of
our time is that we ought to interest ourselves in the so-called
moral i1ltention behind wrong actions, and to imagine
[voTZustellen] inferior [schlechte] subjects with allegedly good
hearts, i.e. hearts which will their own welfare and perhaps
even the welfare of others. This maxim derives in part from
the pre-Kantian period of sensibility fguten Herzer/sF and con­
stitutes, for example, the quintessence of familiar and affect­
ing dramatic presentations.2 But this doctrine has also been
revived in a more extreme shape, and inner enthusiasm and
1 53

Philosophy ofRight
the emotions, i.e. the jOml of particularity as such, have been
made the criterion of what is right, rational, and excellent. As
a result, crimes and their guiding principles, even if these
should be the most banal and empty fancies and foolish
opinions, are presented as right, rational, and excellent on the
grounds that they are based on �asm
(for further details, see Remarks to § 1 40 below). - In addition, we must bear in mind the point of view from which right
and welfare are being examined here - namely as formal right
and the particular welfare of the individual [des Ei1lzelnen].
The so-called com11/Oll weal or welfore of the state, i.e. the right
of the actual and concrete spirit, is an altogether different
sphere, in which formal right is just as much a subordinate
moment as particular welfare and the happiness of the
individual. We have already noted above [see § 29] that one 0

The Good and the Conscience

§ 1 29
The good is the Idea, as the unity of the COtlCept of the will and the
ygrticular .Nll, in which abstract right, welfare, the subjectivity of
knowing, and the contingency of external existence [Dasein], as self­
sufficient for themselves, are superseded; but they are at the same time
essentially contained and preserved within it. - [The good is] realized
freedom, the absolute and ultimate end of the world.
Addition (H). Every stage is in fact the Idea, but the earlier
stages contain
it only in more abstract form. For example, even the '!, as personality is
aIready the Idea, but in its most abstract shape. The good is therefore the
Idea as fimher detennitled, the unity of die concept of the will and the
particular will. It does not belong to abstract right, but has a complete
content whose import encompasses both right and welfare.

Within this idea, welfare has no validity for itself as the existence
[Daseitl] of the individual and particular will, but only as universal
welfare and essentially as universal in itself, i.e. in accordance with
freedom; welfare is not a good without right. Similarly, right is not the
good without welfare (fiat iustitia should not have pereat mundus"l as its
consequence). Thus, since the good must necessarily be actualized
through the particular will, and since it is at the same time the latter's

'Let justice be done, even if the world should perish.'

substance, it has an absolute right as distinct from the abstract right of
property and the particular ends of welfare. In so far as either of the
latter moments is distinguished from the good, it has validity only in
so far as it is in conformity with it and subordinate to it.

I

For the subjective will, the good is likewise absolutely essential, and the
subjective will has worth and dignity only in so far as its insight and
intention are in conformity with the good. In so far as the good is still
at this point this abstract Idea of the good, the subjective will is not yet
posited as assimilated to it and in conformity with it. It thus stands in a
relatiollship to the good, a relationship whereby the good ought to be its
substantial character, whereby it ought to make the good its end and
fulfil it - just as it is only in the subjective will that the good for its part
has the means of entering into actuality.

AdditiOll (H).

f/

/i

The good is the truth of the particular will, but the will is
only what it commits itself to; it is not by nature good, but can become
what it is only by its own efforts. On the other hand, the good itself,
without the subjective will, is only an abstraction, devo

development of the good accordingly has three stages: (I) the good must
be a particular will for me - since I am a will myself - and I must know it;
(2) the nature of the good must be stated, and the particular determina­
tions of the good must be developed; (:) and lastly, the good must be
determined for itself and particularized as infinite subjectivity which has
being for itself. This inward determination is conscience.

right of objectivity takes the following shape: since action is an
alteration which must exist in an actual world and thus seeks
recognition in it, it must in general conform to what is

recognized as valid in that world. Whoever wills an action in the
actual world has, in so doing, submitted himself to its laws and
recognized the right of objectivity. - Similarly, in the state, as
the objectivity of the concept of reason, legal responsibility [die
gerichtliche Zureclzlllmg] must not stop at what the individual
considers to be in conformity with his reason or otherwise, or
at his subjective insight into rightness or wrongness, good or
evil, or at what he may require in order to satisfY his convic­
tion. In this objective field, the right of insight applies to
insight into

Philosophy ofRight
of the laws and the universality of customs, the state takes
away from the right of insight its formal aspect and that con­
tingency which this right still has for the subject within the
prevailing viewpoint [of morality]. The right of the subject to
know [kennetl] action in its determination of good or evil, legal
or illegal, has the effect, in the case of children, imbeciles, and
lunatics, of diminishing or annulling [auftuheben] their
responsibility in this respect, too; but it is impossible to
impose a definite limit [bestimmte Grenze] on these conditions
and the level of responsibility associated with them. But to
make momentary blindness, the excitement of passion, intoxi­
cation, or in general what is described as the strength of
sensuous motives [Triebftdem] (but excluding anything which
gives grounds for a right of necessity - see § 1 27)" into
grounds for attributing responsibility or determining the
[nature of the] crime itself and its culpability, and to consider
such circumstances as taking away the criminal's guilt
[Schuld], is once again (cf. § 100 and Remarks to § 1 20)b to
deny the criminal the right and dignity [Ehre] of a human
being; for the nature of a human being consists precisely in
the fact that he is essentially universal in character, not an
abstraction of the moment and a single fragment of know­
ledge. - Just as what the arsonist sets on fire is not the isolated
area of wood an inch wide to which he applies the flame, but
the universal

this moment or this isolated passion for revenge. Ifhe were so,
he would be an animal which should be hit on the head
because of its dangerousness and proneness to unpredictable
fits of rage. - It is said that the criminal, at the moment of his
action, must have a clear representatioll [sich . . . miisse vorgestellt

appears to uphold his right of moral subjectivity, in fact denies

the good and falls within the subjective will, the good is initially
determined only as universal abstract esse1ltiality - i.e. as duty. In view of
this determinatio� should be done.for the sake ofduty.!

Additiotl (H). The essential element of the will for me is duty. Now if I
know nothing apart from the fact that the good is my duty, I do not go

J?eyond duty in the abstrac,t. I should do my duty for its own sake, and It IS
in the true sense my own objectivity that I bring to fulfilment in doing so.
In doing my duty, I am with myself [bei 11lir selbst] and fue. The merit and
exalted viewpoint of Kant's moral philosophy are that it has emphasized
this significance of duty.

Since action for itself requires a particular content and a determinate
end, whereas duty in the abstract contains nothing of the kind, the
question arises: what is duty? For this definition [Besti11l11lung], all that
is available so far is this: to do right, and to promote welfare, one's own
welfare and welfare in its universal determination, the welfare of
others (see § I I9).

Addition (H). This is the very question which was put to Jesus when
someone wished to know what to do in order to gain eternal Iife.J�
universal aspect of good, or good in the abstrac; cannot be fulfilled as an
abstraction; it must first acquire the further determination of particularity.

Philosophy ofRight
§ I35
These detenninations, however, are not contained in the determina­
tion of duty itself. But since both of them are conditional and limited,
they give rise to the transition to the higher sphere of the uncondi­
tional, the sphere of duty. Hence all that is left for duty itself, in so far
as it is the essential or universal element in the moral self-conscious­
ness as it is related within itself to itself alone, is abstract universality,
whose determination is identity without content or the abstracdy posi­
tive, i.e. the indeterminate.

"

However essential it may be to emphasize the pure and
unconditional self-detennination of the will as the root of duty
- for knowledge [Erkenlllnis] of the will first gained a firm
foundation and point of departure in the philosophy of Kant,
through the thought of its infinite autonomy (see § 1 33) - to
cling on to a merely moral point of view without making the
transition to the concept of ethics reduces this gain to an empty
fimnalism, and moral science to an empty rhetoric of duty for
duty 's sake. From this point of view, no immanent theory of
duties is possible. One may indeed bring in material from
outside and thereby arrive at particular duties, but it is imposs­
ible to make the transition to the determination of particular
duties from the above determination of duty as absence of
contradiction, as formal correspondence with itself, which is no
different from the specification of abstract indeternlinacy; and
even if such a particular content for action is taken into con­
sideration, there is no criterion within that principle for decid­
ing whether or not this content is a duty. On the contrary, it is
possible to justifY any wrong or immoral mode of action by
this means. - Kant's further form - the capacity of an action
to be envisaged as a universal maxim - does yield a more
concrete representation [Vorstelllmg] of the situation in ques­
tion, but it does not in itself [fiir sidl] contain any principle
apart from formal identity and that absence of contradiction
already referred to. - The fact that 110 property is present is in
itself [fiir sich] no more contradictory than is the non-existence
of this or that individual people, family, etc., or the complete
absence of human life. But if it is already established and
1 62

Morality
presupposed that property and human life should exist and be
respected, then it is a contradiction to commit theft or
murder; a contradiction must be a contradiction with some­
thing, that is, with a content which is already fundamentally
present as an established principle. Only to a principle of this
kind does an action stand in a relation [Beziehung] of agree­
ment or contradiction. But if a duty is to be willed merely as a
duty and not because of its content, it is aflmzal identity which
necessarily excludes every content and determination.
The further antinomies and shapes assumed by this peren­
nial obligation, among which the merely moral point of view of
relationship simply drifts to. and fro without being able to
resolve them and get beyond obligation, are developed in my
Phenomenology of Spirit, pp. 55 0ff.; cf. Encyclopaedia of the
Philosophical Sciences, § § 42 0f[.1

Additi01l (H). Whereas we earlier emphasized that the point of view of

Kant's philosophy is sublime inasmuch as it asserts the conformity of duty
and reason, it must be pointed out here that this point ofview is defective
in that it lacks all articulation. For the proposition 'Consider whether your
,
maxim can be asserted as a universal principle 2 would be all very well if
we already had determinate principles concerning how to act. In other
words, if we demand of a principle that it should also be able to serve as
the determinant of a universal legislation, this presupposes that it already
has a content; and if this content were present, it would be easy to apply
the principle. But in this case, the principle itself is not yet available, and
the criterion that there should be no contradiction is non-productive - for
where there is nothing, there can be no contradiction either.

Because of the abstract character of the good, the other moment of
the Idea, i.e. particularity in general, falls within subjectivity. Subjec­
tivity, in its universality reflected into itself, is the absolute inward
certainty of itself; it is that which posits particularity, and it is the
determining and decisive factor -;- the c!!!!science. /

Additiotz (H). One may speak of duty in a most sublime manner, and such
talk glorifies the human being and fills his heart with pride. But if it leads
to nothing determinate, it ultimately grows tedious, for the spirit requires
that particularity to which it is entitled. Conscience, on the other hand, is

Philosophy ofRight
that deepest inner solitude within oneself in which all externals and all
limitation have disappeared -: it is a total withdrawal into the self. As
conscience, the human being is no longer boun
y e en s of particu­
larity, so that conscience represents an exalted point of view, a point of
view of the modern world, which has for the first time attained this
consciousness, this descent into the self. Earlier and more sensuous ages
have before them something external and given, whether this be religion
or right; but [my] conscience knows itself as thought, and that this
thought of mine is my sole source of obligation.

True conscience is the disposition to will what is good

in andfor itself,

it therefore has fixed principles, and these have for it the character of
determinacy and duties which are objective for themselves. In con­

trast to its content - i.e. truth - conscience is merely theflm/al as�

�ctive system of these principles and duties and

the union of subjective knowledge with this system are present only

when the point of view of ethics has been reached. Here, within the

expresses the absolute entitlement of subjective

self-consciousness to know

in itself and from itselfwhat right

and duty are, and to recognize only what it thus knows as the

right and duty. AI; this unity of subjective

knowledge and that which has being in and for itself, con­

science is a sanctuary which it would be sacrilege to violate. But
whether the conscience of a

specific individual is in conformity

with this Idea of conscience, and whether what it

declares to be good is also actually good, can be recognized only
from the

determinations, is essentially neither the partiCll lar property of
an individual, nor is itsform that of feeling

essentially that of

universal detemlinations of thought,

form of laws and principles. The conscience is therefore sub­
ject to judgement as to its truth or falsity, and its appeal solely
to itsel/is direcdy opposed to what it seeks to be - that is, the
rule for a rational and universal mode of action which is valid
in and for itself. Consequendy, the state cannot recognize the
conscience in its distinctive form, i.e. as subjective Imowledge,
any more than science can grant any validity to subjective
opinion, assertion, and the appeal to subjective opinion. What is
not distinct within the true conscience is nevertheless dis­
tinguishable, and it is the determining subjectivity of know­
ledge and volition which can separate itself from the true
content, posit itself for itself, and reduce the content to a 10m
and semblance. The ambiguity associated with conscience
therefore consists in the fact that conscience is assumed in
advance to signity the identity of subjective knowledge and
volition with the true good, and is thus declared and acknow­
ledged to be sacrosanct, while it also claims, as the purely
subjective reflection of self-consciousness into itself, the
authority [Berechtiglt1lg] which belongs only to that identity
itself by virtue of its rational content which is valid in and for
itself. The point of view of morality, which is distinguished in
this treatise from that of ethics, includes only the formal
conscience; the true conscience has been mentioned only in
order to indicate its different character, and to prevent the
possible misunderstanding to the effect that we are here dis­
cussing the true conscience rather than the formal con­
science, which is in fact our exclusive concern. The true
conscience is contained in the ethical disposition, which will
be considered only in the following section. The religious
conscience, however, lies completely outside this sphere. I

Addition (H). When we speak of conscience, it may easily be thought that,

because its form is that of abstract inwardness, it is already in and for
itself the true conscience. But the true conscience is that which
determines itself to will what is in and for itself the good and a duty. Here,
however, we are dealing only with good in the abstract, and conscience
still lacks this objective content and is as yet only the infinite certainty of
itself.

The self-consciousness which has managed to attain this
absolute reflection into itself knows itselfin this reflection as a
consciousness which cannot and should not be compromised
by any present and given determination. In the shapes which it
more commonly assumes in history (as in the case of Socrates,
the Stoics, etc.), the tendency to look inwards into the self and
to know and determine from within the self what is right and
good appears in epochs when what is recognized as right and
good in actuality and custom is unable to satisfY the better
will. When the existing world of freedom has become unfaith­
ful to the better will, this will no longer finds itself in the
duties recognized in ibis world and must seek to recover in
ideal inwardness alone that harmony which it has lost in actu�. Once self-consci�as grasped and acquiredits
formal right in this way, everything depends on the kind of
content which it gives to itself. I

Additi01l (H). If we look more closely at this process of evaporation and

observe how all determinations are absorbed into this simple concept and
must again issue forth from it, we can see that the process depends
primarily on the fact that everything which we recognize as right or duty
can · be shown by thought to be null and void, limited, and in no way
absolute. Conversely, just as subjectivity evaporates every content into
itself, it rna also in turn develop it out of itself. I:;very!hing wJlich arises in
-�lm--E pro uce y this aCllvity o�. On the other
hand, this point of view is defective inasmuch as it is merely abstract.
When I am aware of my freedom as the substance within me, I am inactive
and do nothing. But if ! proceed to act and look for principles, I reach out
for determinations, and there is then a requirement that these should be
deduced from the concept of the free will. Thus, while it is right to
evaporate right or duty into subjectivity, it is on the other hand wrong if
this abstract foundation is not in turn developed. Only in ages when the

actual world is a hollow, spiritless, and unsettled existence [Existenz] may
the individual be permitted to flee from actuality and retreat into his inner
life. Socrates made his appearance at the time when Athenian democracy
had fallen into ruin. He evaporated the existing world and retreated into
himself in search of the right and the good. Even in our times it happens
that reverence for the existing order is in varying degrees absent, and
people seek to equate accepted values with their own will, with what they
have recognized.

Where all previously valid determinations have vanished and the will
is in a state of pure inwardness, the self-consciousness is capable of
making into its principle either the universal in and for itself, or the
arbitrariness of its own particularity, giving the latter precedence over
the universal and realizing it through its actions - i.e� it is capa�e of

Conscience, as formal subjectivity, consists simply in the
possibility of turning at any moment to evil; for both morality
and evil have their common root in that self-certain!}' which
has be�d knows and resolves for itself.
The origin of evil in general lies in the mystery - i.e. the
speculative aspect - of freedom, in the necessity with which it
emerges from the �ase of the will and adopts a
character of inwardness in relation to it. It is this natural phase
of the will which comes into existence [Existenz] as self-con­
tradiction, as incompatible with itself in this opposition, and
thus it is this particularity of the will itself which further
aetermines itself as evil. For particularity exists orily as a
duali� - in the present case as the opposition between the
will's natural phase and its inwardness. Within this opposi­
tion, the will's inwardness is only a relative and formal being­
for-itself which can derive its content only from the
determinations of the natural will, from desire, drive, inclina­
tion, etc. Now it is said of these desires, drives, etc. that they
may be either good or evil. But when the will lets its content be
determined by these desires etc. in the determination of con­
tingency which they have as natural [forces], and hence also by
the form which it [i.e. the will] has at this point, the form of

_1-

I 3 8-I39

Philosophy ofRight
particularity, it thereby becomes opposed to twiversality as
inner objectivity, i.e. to the good, which, along with the will's
internal self-reflection and the cognitive [erke1l11etldetl] con­
sciousness, makes its appearance as the opposite extreme to
immediate objectivity, to the merely natural kthis case, the
inwardness of the will is evil. The human being is therefore
�re and at the same time through
his reflectioll i1lto himself, so that neither nature as such (apart
from the naturalness of the will which remains tied to its
particular content) nor reflection tumed ill UPOll itself, i.e. in
cognition in general (unless it remains attached to that
opposition already referred to) is in itself [fiir sich] evil. Absolutely united with this aspect of the lIecessity ofevil is also
the fact that this evil is determined as that which of necessity
ought 1I0t to be, i.e. the fact that it ought to be cancelled
[au./kehobetl]. It is 1I0t that the point of view of division referred
to above ought never to appear at all - on the contrary, it is
this which constitutes the distinction between the unreasoning
animal and the human being. But the will must not stop short
at this point and cling on to particularity instead of the univer­
sal as the essential; the point of view of division should be
overcome as null and void. In connection with this necessity of
evil, [we should also note that] it is subjectivity, as the infinity of
this reflection, which is faced with and present \vithin this
opposition; if it stops short at this juncture - i.e. if it is evil - it
is consequently presentfor itself, retains its separate individu­
ality, and is itself this arbitrary will. It is accordingly the
individual subject as such which bears the entire respollsibility

for its OWlI evil."
Addition (H). The abstract certainty which knows itself as the basis of
everything has within it the possibility of willing the universal of the
concept, but also that of making a particular content into its principle and
realizing this content. It follows that the abstraction of self-certainty is
always a part of evil, which is the second of these alternatives, and that
only the human being is good - but only in so far as he can also be evil.
Good and evil are inseparable, and their inseparability derives from the

"Translalor's nole: I follow Hting (VP R II, 496) in reading seines Bosen ('its own c\il')

iWoralit),
fact that the concept becomes its own object [Gegenstalldj and, as object,
immediately embodies the determination of difference. The evil will wills
something opposed to the universality of the will, whereas the good acts in
accordance with its true concept. The difficulty about the question of how
the will can also be evil usually arises because we think of the \vill as
having only a positive relationship to itself, and envisage it as something
determinate which exists for itself, i.e. as the good. But the question of the
origin of evil signifies more precisely this: 'How does the negative come
into the positive?' If we presuppose that, at the creation of the world, God
is the absolutely positive, it is impossible to recognize the negative within
this positive, no matter which way we turn; for to assume that evil was
permitted by God is to assume on his part a passive relationship which is
unsatisfactory and meaningless. In the representational thought [VoTStel­
IlIng] of religious myth, the origin of evil is not comprehended; that is,
there is no recognition of the one in the other, but only a representation
[VoTStellll1lg] of succession and coexistence whereby the negative comes to
the positive from outside. But this cannot satisfY thought, which demands
a reason [Gnmdj and a necessity and seeks to apprehend the negative as
itself rooted in the positive. The solution [of this problem], from the point
of view of the concept, is contained in the concept itself, for the concept ­
or in more concrete terms, the Idea has the essential characteristic of
differentiating itself and positing itself negatively. If we merely stick to the
positive, i.e. to the wholly good which is supposedly good in its origin, we
have an empty determination of the understanding which clings to such
one-sided abstractions and, by the mere act of asking the question, makes
it into a difficult one. But from the point of view of the concept, positivity
is apprehended as activity and self-differentiation. Thus, evil as well as
good has its origin in the will, and the will in its concept is both good and
evil. The natural will is in itself the contradiction of self-differentiation, of
being [both] for itself and inward. To say then that evil contains the more
precise determination that the human being is evil in so far as his will is
natural would run counter to the common idea [VoTStelftl1lg] that it is
precisely the natural will which is innocent and good. But the natural will
is opposed to d\!! content of freedom, and the child and uneducated man
whose wills are natural are for that reason accountable for their actions
only to a lesser degree. Thus, when we speak of human beings, we do not
mean children but self-conscious individuals, and when we speak of the
good, we mean knowledge of the good. Now it is true that the natural is in
itself ingenuous, neither good nor evil; but in relation to the ,viII as
freedom and as knowledge of freedom, the natural contains the
determination of the unfree, and is therefore evil. In so far as man wills
the natural, it is no longer merely the natural but the negation of the good

as the concept of the will. - But if it were now to be argued that, since evil
is inherent in the concept and necessary, man would not be responsible if
he committed it, it must be replied that the decision is man's own act, the
product of his freedom and responsibility. Religious myth tells us that
man is like God in his knowledge [Erketllll1lis] of good and evil, and this
likeness is indeed present in that the necessity here is not a natural
necessity - on the contrary, the decision is in fact the cancellation
[AuJhebtmg] of this duality of good and evil. Since I am confronted with

both good and evil, I am able to choose between them; I can choose either
of them and accept one or the other into my subjectivity. It is thus in the
nature of evil that man may will it, but need not necessarily do so.

The self-consciousness knows how to discover a positive aspect in its
own end (see

concrete

§ 1 35); for this end, as part of �n actual

action, necessarily has a positive aspect. By virtue of this

positive aspect, [which it regards] as a

duty and admirable inteT1tion, the

self-consciousness is able to assert that its action is good both for

others and for itself. But because

of its

This last and most abstruse form of evil, whereby evil is
perverted into good and good into evil and the consciousness,
knowing that it has the power to accomplish this reversal,
consequently knows itself as absolute, is the greatest extreme
of subjectivity from the point of view of morality. It is the form
to which evil has advanced in our time - thanks to philosophy,
i.e. to a shallowness of thought which has twisted a profound
concept into this shape and has presumed to call itself philo­
sophy, just as it has presumed to call evil good. In these
present Remarks, I shall briefly indicate the principal shapes
which this subjectivity commonly assumes.
(a)

Hypocrisy contains the following moments: (a) knowledge

of the true universal, whether in the form merely of a

Morality

§§

1 39-1 40

feeling of right and duty or of a more advanced knowledge
[Kenntnis] and cognition of these; (�) a willing of the
particular which is at odds with this universal; and (y) a
knowing comparison of these two moments so that the
particular volition is detennined, for the willing con­
sciousness itself, as evil. These detenninations signify act­
ing with a bad conscience, but not yet hypocrisy as such. - It
was at one time a question of great importance whether an
action was evil only in so for as it was done with a bad
conscience, i.e. with a developed consciousness of the
moments indicated above. - Pascal (Lettres provinciales, 4)
describes very well what follows from answering this
question in the affinnative: '11 seront tous damnes ces
derni-pecheurs, qui ont quelque amour pour la vertu.
Mais pour ces francs pecheurs, pecheurs endurcis,
pecheurs sans melange, pleins et acheves, l'enfer ne les
tient pas: ils ont trompe Ie diable a force de s'y abandon­
ner.'at - The subjective right of self-consciousness to
know an action in its detennination as either good or evil
in and for itself must not be thought of as colliding with
the absolute right of the objectivity of this detennination in
such a way that the two are represented as separable, and
" TrallSlator's note: 'They will all be damned, these half-sinners who retain some love of
virtue. But as for those open sinners, hardened sinners, undiluted, complete, and
consummate sinners, hell cannot hold them: they have deceived the devil by their
complete surrender.' l

tHegel's note: In the same context, Pascal also quotes christ's intercession on the Cross

,
for his enemies: 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do 2 - a superfluous
request if the fact that they did not know what they were doing removed the quality of
evil from their action so that it did not require forgiveness. He likewise cites the
opinion of Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics 1Il.2 [ I I I Ob27]), who distinguishes between
acting OUK Etbw£ and acting ayvowv;b3 in the former case of ignorance, the person
concerned acts iTtVOlullIan"ly (this ignorance relates to external cirCllmstances; see § 1 1 7
above), and he cannot be held responsible for his action.4 But of the latter instance,
Aristotle says: 'All \vicked men fail to recognize what they should do and refrain from
doing, and it is this very defect (uflag1:ia) which makes people unjust and in general
evil. Ignorance of the choice between good and evil does not mean that an action is
involuntary (i.e. that the agent cannot be held responsible for it), but only that it is bad.'s
Aristotle, of course, had a deeper insight into the connection between cognition and
volition than has become usual in that superficial philosophy which teaches that emotion
and enthusiasm, not cognition, are the true principles of ethical action.6
bTraTlslator's note: OUK Etbw£ ('\vithout perception') is translated by both David Ross and
Terence Irwin as 'in ignorance'; ayvowv (,from ignorance') is translated by Ross as 'by
reason of ignorance' and by Irwin as 'caused by ignorance'.

Philosophy ofRight
indifferent and contingent towards one another; it was the
latter relationship in particular which was regarded as
fundamental in the old debates about efficacious grace.1 In
its formal aspect, evil is the individual's most distinctive
property, because it is precisely his subjectivity positing
itself entirely for itself, and is therefore entirely his
responsibility (see § 1 3 9 and the appended Remarks); and
on the objective side, man is by his concept spirit and
rationality in general, and has the determination of self­
knowing universality wholly within himself. It is therefore
to deny him the honour due to his concept if his good side
- and hence also the determination of his evil action as
evil - is divorced from him and he is not made responsible
for his evil action either. How determinate the conscious­
ness of these moments in their respective differences is,
what degree of clarity or obscurity it has attained as devel­
oped cognition, and to what extent the conscience associ­
ated with an evil action is more or less evil in flml - all
these are less important questions of a more empirical
character.
(b) To act in an evil manner and with an evil conscience does
not amount to hypocrisy.8 Hypocrisy includes in addition
�a
s, whereby evil
is in the first place represented for others as good and the
evildoer pretends in all external respects to be good, con­
scientious, pious, etc. - which in this case is merely a trick
to deceive others. But secondly, the evil person may find in
the good he does at other times, or in his piety, or in good
reasons of any kind, a means of justifYingfor himselJthe evil
he does, in that he can use these reasons to distort it into
something he considers good. This possibility exists
within subjectivity, for, as abstract negativity, it knows that
all determinations are subordinate to it and emanate from
it.
(c) We must in the first place include in this distortion that
attitude [Gestalt] known as probabilism.9 It adopts the
principle that an action is permissible and can be done in
good conscience if the consciousness can discover any
good reason [Gnmd] for it - even if this is merely the

Ld�

Morality
authority of a single theologian, and even if other theolo­
gians are known to diverge very considerably from the
former's judgement. Even in this notion [Vorstelltmg],
there is still present the correct consciousness that a
reason and authority of this kind affords only a probability,
although this is regarded as sufficient to satisfY the con­
science. It is at the same time conceded that a good reason
is merely of such a kind that other reasons of at least equal
merit may exist alongside it. A further trace of objectivity
can be discerned in this attitude in so far as it assumes
that a reason should be the determining factor. But since
the decision between good and evil is made to depend
upon many good reasons, including those authorities
already referred to - despite the fact that these reasons
are so numerous and discordant - it is also apparent that it
is not this objectivity of the thing [Sache], but subjeaivity,
which is the decisive factor. As a result, [personal] prefer­
ence and the arbitrary will are made the arbiters of good
and evil, and both ethics and religiosity are undermined.
But the fact that it is the agent's own subjectivity which
makes the decision is not yet acknowledged as the [gov­
erning] principle - on the contrary (as already men­
tioned), it is claimed that a reason is the decisive factor.
To this extent, probabilism is still a form of hypocrisy.
(d) The stage immediately above this is [the view] that the
good will consists in willing the good; this willing ofgood in
the abstraa is supposed to be sufficient, indeed the sole
prerequisite, for the goodness of the action itself. Since
the action, as detenninate volition, has a content, whereas
good in the abstraa determines nothing, it remains the task
of particular subjectivity to give this abstraction its
determination and fulfilment. Just as, in the case of probabilism, anyone who is not himself a learned Reverend Pere
relies on the -alilliOity
i of such a theologian in order to
subsume a determinate content under the universal
determination of the good, so in this case is every subject
immediately accorded the honour [Wiirde] of providing
the abstract good with a content, or - and this amounts to
the same thing - of subsuming a content under a univer1 73

Philosophy ofRight
sal. This content is only one of the various aspects of a
concrete action, some of which may even justifY its des­
cription as criminal and bad. But that subjective
determination which I give to the good is the good which I
know in the action, i.e. my good intention (see § 1 14).
There thus arises a conflict of determinations, for one of
them suggests that an action is good, whereas others sug­
gest that it is criminal.lO It thus seems that the question
also arises, in the case of an actual action, whether the
intention is actually good. But it may not only be generally
the case that the good is the actual intention; it must in
fact always be so if we adopt the point of view that the
abstract good is the determining ground of the subject.
An injury done by a well-intentioned action whose
determination is in other respects criminal and evil is, of
course, also good, and all would seem to depend on which
aspect of the action is the most essential. But this objective
question is not applicable here - or rather, it is the subjec­
tivity of consciousness itself whose decision alone con­
stitutes the objective element. Essential and good are in any
case synonymous; the former is just as much an abstrac­
tion as the latter; good is what is essential iwith regard to
the will, and what should be essential in Ithis respect is
precisely that an action is determined as good for me. But
this abstract good, being completely lacking in content,
can be wholly reduced simply to meaning anything positive
at all - anything, that is, which has any kind of validity and
which, in its immediate determination, may even count as
an essential end (such as doing good to the poor, or caring
for myself, my life, my family, etc.). The immediate
consequence of this for itself is that any content one
pleases can be subsumed under the good. Furthermore,
just as the good is an abstraction, so consequently is the
bad likewise devoid of content, receiving its determination
from my subjectivity; and this is also the source of the
moral end of hating and eradicating the bad as an indeter­
minate quality. - Theft, cowardice, murder, etc., as
actions - i.e. as products in general of a subjective will have the immediate determination of being the satisfoction
1 74

Morality
of such a will, and hence of being something positive; and
in order to make the action into a good one, it is merely a
question of knowing this positive aspect as my i1ltention in
performing the action, and this aspect is then the essential
factor in determining the action as good, because I know
it as the good in my intention. Theft in order to benefit
the poor, theft or desertion in battle for the sake of one's
duty to care for one's life or one's (perhaps even
impoverished) family, murder for hatred and revenge i.e. in order to satisfY a self-awareness of one's own rights
or of right in general, and one's sense of someone else's
wickedness, of wrong done by him to oneself or to others,
to the world or the people in general, by eliminating this
wicked individual who is wickedness personified, and
thereby contributing at least something towards the end of
eradicating the bad - all of these deeds, by virtue of the
positive aspect of their content, are in this way trans­
formed into well-intentioned and consequently good
actions.!} Even the lowest degree of understanding is
enough to discover, like those learned theologians, a posi­
tive aspect in every action and hence a good reason and
intention underlying it. Thus it has been said that there is
in fact no such thing as an evil man, for no one wills evil
for the sake of evil - i.e. the purely negative as such - but
always something positive, and hence, according to the
point of view in question, always something good. In this
abstract good, the distinction between good and evil, as
well as all actual duties, has vanished; consequently,
merely to will the good and to have a good intention in
one's action is more like evil than good, in that the good is
willed only in this abstract form so that its determination is
left to the arbitrary will of the subject.
To this context there also belongs the notorious prop­
osition that the endjustifies the meansP - Taken on its own,
this expression is at first sight trivial and vacuous. It may
be replied in equally indeterminate fashion that a just end
doubtless justifies the means, whereas an unjust end does
not. [To say] that the means is right if the end is right is a
tautological statement inasmuch as the means is precisely

Philosophy ojRight
that which is nothing in itself [fUr sich] but exists for the
sake of something else and has its determination and
value in the latter as its end - that is, ifit is truly a means. ­
But the meaning of the above proposition lies not just in
its formal significance; it can also be understood in the
more determinate sense that it is permissible, and perhaps
even one's duty, to use as a means to a good end some­
thing which in itself is not a means at all, to violate some­
thing which is in itself sacrosanct, and thus to make a
crime the means to a good end. In [those who follow] this
proposition, there is on the one hand an indeterminate
consciousness of the dialectic of the aforementioned posi­
tive element in isolated determinations of right or ethics,
or of equally indeterminate general propositions such as
'Thou shalt not kill' or 'Care for your own welfare and
that of your family'. Courts of law and soldiers have not
only the right but also the duty to kill human beings; but
in this case, there are precise definitions as to what kind of
people and what circumstances make this permissible and
obligatory. In the same way, my welfare and that of my
family must also b� subordinated to higher ends and
thereby reduced to a means. But what we describe as a
crime is not a general proposition of this kind, left inde­
terminate and still subject to a dialectic; on the contrary, it
is already delimited in a determinate and objective
manner. Now what is set up in opposition to this
determination - namely that sacred end which is sup­
posed to exonerate the crime - is nothing other than a
subjective opinion of what is good or better. It is the same
thing as happens when volition stops short at the abstract
good,.so that every determinate characteristic of good and
evil or right and wrong which has being and validity in and
for itself is cancelled [atifkehoben], and this determination
is assigned instead to the feeling, imagination [Vor.stellen],
and caprice of the individual.
(e) Subjective opinion is at last expressly acknowledged as the
criterion of right and duty when it is alleged that the
ethical nature of an action is determined by the conviction
which holds something to be rightP The good which is

1

Morality
willed does not yet have a content; and the principle of
conviction contains the further specification that the sub­
sumption of an action under the determination of the
good is the responsibility of the

subject.

Under these

circumstances, any semblance of ethical objectivity has
completely disappeared. Such doctrines are intimately
connected

with

that

self-styled

philosophy,

frequently referred to, which denies that

already

truth - and the

truth of the spirit as will, its rationality in so far as it
actualizes itself, is to be found in the precepts of ethics can be recognized. Since such philosophizing maintains
that the knowledge

[Erkenntnis] of truth is an empty vanity
[Erketmen], and

which transcends the sphere of cognition

that the latter is a mere semblance, it must immediately
make this very semblance its principle as far as action is
concerned, and thereby equate the ethical with the distinc­

tive outlook of the

individual and his

particular conviction.

The degradation into which philosophy has thus sunk
seems at first glance, in the eyes of the world, an utterly

indifferent happening which has affected only the idle talk

of academics; but such a view necessarily becomes part of
our view of ethics, which is an essential component of
philosophy, and only then do the implications of these
views become apparent in and for [the realm of] actuality.
- The dissemination of the view that subjective conviction
is the sole determinant of the ethical nature of an action
has had the effect that references to

hypocrisy, which used

to be frequent, are nowadays uncommon; for to describe
evil as hypocrisy implies that certain actions are itl andfor

thetnselves misdemeanours, vices, and crimes, and that the
perpetrator is necessarily aware of them as such in so far
as he knows and acknowledges the principles and outward
acts of piety and integrity

[Rechtlichkeit]

even within the

pretence in whose interest he misuses them. Or in rela­
tion to evil in general, it used to be assumed that it is a
duty to recognize the good and to know how to distinguish
it from evil. But it was at all events an absolute require­
ment that human beings should not commit vicious and
criminal acts, and that they should be held responsible for

1 77

Philosophy ojRight
such acts in so far as they are human beings rather than
animals. But if a good heart, good intentions, and subjec­
tive conviction are said to be the factors which give actions
their value, there is no longer any hypocrisy or evil at all;
for a person is able to transform whatever he does into
something good by the reflection of good intentions and
motives [Bewegungsgriinde], and the element [Moment] of
his conviction renders it good. t Thus, there is no longer
such a thing as crime or vice in and for itself, and instead
of those free and open, hardened and undiluted sinners
referred to above we have a consciousness of complete
justification by intention and conviction. My good inten­
tion in my action and my conviction ofits goodness make it
good. In so far as· we speak of judging and pronouncing a
verdict on an action, this principle requires that the agent
should be judged only in terms of his intention and con­
viction, or of his foith - not in the sense in which Christ
requires faith in objective truth (so that the judgement
passed on a person of bad faith, i.e. on one whose convic­
tion is bad in its content, must also be negative, in keeping
with this evil content), but in the sense of loyalty to one's
conviction (in so far as a person, in his action, remains true
to his conviction), i.e. in the sense of formal, subjective
loyalty, which is alone in keeping with duty. - Since this
principle of conviction is at the same time subjectively
determined, the thought of the possibility of error must
also thrust itself upon us, and this in turn presupposes a
law which has being in and for itself. But the law [itself]
d{)es not act; only an actual human being acts. And, accord­
ing to the above principle, the sole criterion of the worth
of human actions is the extent to which the individual
tHegel's note: 'That he feels completely convinced, I do not doubt in the least. But how
many people proceed from such felt conviction to commit the gravest misdeeds! Thus, if
anything may be excused on such grounds, no rational judgement of good and roil or of
honourable and contemptible deasions is any longer possible; delusion thim has equal rights
with reason, or rather, reason no longer has any rights or valid authority V/nsehenJ
whatsoever; its voice is an absurdity; he who has no doubts is the possessor oftruth!
I tremble at the consequences of such toleration, which would be exclusively to the
advantage of unreason.' (F. H. Jacobi to Count Holmer, Eutin, 5 August 1800, com­
menting on Count Stolberg's change of religion, in Brennus (Berlin, August 180i». /4

Morality
concerned has incorporated the law into his own

conviaion.

But if, by this token, it is not actions which are to be
judged by the law in question - i.e. to be measured by it in
any way - it is impossible to tell what that law is for or
what purpose it is to serve. Such a law is reduced to a
purely

external letter,

indeed to an empty word, for it is

only my conviction which makes it a law and a binding duty
for me. - Such a law may have the authority of God and
the state behind it, and the authority of the thousands of
years for which it was the bond by which human beings
and all their deeds and destinies were held together and
sustained -

authorities which encompass

countless

individual conviaions. If I then set against all this the auth­
ority of my individual conviction - and as my subjective
conviction its validity is merely [that of] authority - this
may at first appear a monstrous presumption. But this
appearance is refuted by the very principle which takes
subjective conviction as its criterion. - If, however, the
higher illogicality of reason and conscience - which shal­
low science and miserable sophistry can never entirely
banish - admits the

possibility of error,

the very fact that

crime and evil in general are classed as error reduces the
fault to a minimum. For to err is human/5 and who has not
been mistaken about this or that circumstance, about
whether there was cabbage or sauerkraut with yesterday's
lunch, and about countless matters of greater and lesser
importance? Yet the distinction between the important
and the unimportant disappears if subjectivity of convic­
tion and adherence to such conviction are the sole
criterion. It is in the nature of the case that the higher
illogicality already referred to should admit the possibility
of error; but when it goes on to say that a bad conviction is
merely an error, it in fact simply becomes another kind of
illogicality, namely that of dishonesty. For in the first
instance, conviction is supposed to be the basis of ethics
and of man's supreme worth, and is thereby declared to
be a supreme and sacred value; and in the second case, all
that we are concerned with is error, and my conviction is
insignificant and contingent, in fact a purely external

1 79

Philosophy ojRight
circumstance which I may

encollllter i71 071e way or a71other.

And my conviction is indeed an extremely insignificant
thing if I cannot recognize the truth; for then it is a matter
of indifference

how I think, and all that remains for me to

think about is that empty good as an abstraction of the
understanding. - It may also be remarked that, as far as

the mode of action of other people in relation to my own
action is concerned, it follows from this principle of justi­
fication on grounds of conviction that, if

their faith

and

crimes,

they

conviction make them regard my actions as
are

quite right to do so - a consequence whereby I am not

only denied all credit in advance, but am on the contrary
simply reduced from a position of freedom and honour to
a situation of unfreedom and dishonour. In the justice to
which I am here subjected - and which in itself is also my
own justice - I merely experience someone else's subjec­
tive conviction and, when it is implemented, I consider
myself acted upon merely by an external force.
(f) Finally, the supreme form in which this subjectivity is
completely comprehended and expressed is that to which
the term 'irony', borrowed from Plato, has been applied./6
Only the name is taken from Plato, however, for Plato
used it of a method which Socrates employed in personal
dialogue to defend the Idea of truth and justice against the
complacency of the uneducated consciousness and that of
the Sophists; but it was only this consciousness which he
treated ironically, not the Idea itself. Irony concerns only a
manner of speaking in relation to people; without this per­
sonal direction, the essential movement of thought is
dialectic, and Plato was so far from treating the dialectic
kl

in itself (fiir sich], let alone irony, as the ultimate factor and
as the Idea itself that, on the contrary, he ended the to and
fro of thought, and particularly of subjective opinion, by
submerging it in the substantiality of the Idea. t The only

tHegel's note: My late colleague Professor Solger/7 did admittedly take over the expres­
sion 'irony' which Friedrich von Schlegel introduced during an earlier period of his
literary career and whose meaning he extended to include that subjectivity which knows
itself as supreme. But Solger's better judgement rejected this definition [BestimmungJ,
and his philosophical insight seized upon and retained only one aspect of it, namely the

possible culmination - and this must now be discussed of that subjectivity which regards itself as the ultimate
instance is reached when it

knows itself as

that power of

resolution and decision on [matters of] truth, right, and

dialectical element proper, the activating pulse of speculative reflection. But I do not find
his conclusions entirely clear, nor can I agree with the concepts which he develops in his
last, substantial work, his detailed Critiqlle ojAllgllst Wilhelm von Schlegel's Lectures on
DramaticArt andLiteratllre (WienerJahrbuch, Vol. VII, pp. 90ff.). 'True irony', says Solger
on that occasion (p. 92), 'starts from the point of view that, as long as human beings live
in this present world, it is only in this world that they can fulfil their destiny, even in the
highest sense of that word. Any means whereby we believe we can transcendfinite ends is a
vain and empty fancy . . . Even the highest of things is present to our action only in a
limited and finite shape.' This, if understood correcdy, is a Platonic view, very truly
expressed in opposition to that empty striving for the (abstract) infinite which Solger had
previously referred to. But to say that the highest of things is present in a limited and
finite shape, like the realm of ethics - and the ethical realm is essentially actuality and
action - is very different from saying that it is afinite end; the shape and form of finitude
do not deprive the content, i.e. the ethical realm, of any of its substantiality or of the
infinity which is inherent within it. Solger continues: 'And for this very reason, it [the
highest of things] is as insignificant in lIS as the lowest of things, and necessarily perishes
with lIS and ollr insignificant intellects. For it is truly present in God alone, and when it
perishes in us, it is transfigured as something divine, in which we would have no share if
there were not an immediate presence of this divinity which becomes manifest even as
our actuality disappears; but the state of mind to which this presence becomes immedi­
ately evident in human events themselves is tragic irony.' The arbitrary name 'irony'
would not in itself require comment, but there is an unclarity in the statement that it is
the lzighest ojthings which perishes with our insignificance, and that the divine is revealed
only when our actuality disappears, as when we are told on page 91: 'We see heroes lose
faith in the noblest and finest aspects of their dispositions and feelings, not only in
relation to what these lead to, but also in relation to their source and theirvalue; indeed, we
are elevated by the doumfoll oJthe best itself.' The tragic downfall of figures of the highest
ethical worth can interest us, elevate us, and reconcile us to its occurrence only in so far
as such figures appear in mutual opposition, with equally justified but distinct ethical
powers which have unfortunately come into collision. (The just downfall of complete and
self-important rogues and criminaIs - as, for instance, the hero of the modem tragedy
Gllilt [Die SchllldjJ8 - certainly has an interest for criminal law, but not for true art, with
which we are here concerned.) As a result of this opposition to an ethical principle, they
incur guilt, from which the right and wrong of both parties emerges, and with it the true
ethical Idea which, purified and triumphing over this one-sidedness, is thereby reconciled
in us. Accordingly, it is not the highest thing in us which perishes, and we are elevated not
by the doumfoll oJthe best but, on the contrary, by the triumph of the true. This is the true
and purely ethical interest of ancient tragedy, as I have explained more fully in my
Phenomenology oJSpirit (pp. 404ff.; cf. pp. 683ff.)J9 (In romantic tragedy, this determina­
tion undergoes a further modification.) But the ethical Idea, without sllch unfortllnate
collisions and the downfall of the individuals caught up in this misfortune, is actual and
present in the ethical world; and that this highest of things should not appear insignificant
in its actuality is what the real ethical existence [Eristenz], the state, takes as its end and
puts into effect, and what the ethical self-consciousness possesses, intuits, and knows,
and thinking cognition comprehends, in the state.

community whose bond and

conscientiousness, good intentions, and enjoyment of this
reciprocal purity, but above all in basking in the glory of
this self-knowledge and self-expression and of cherishing
and cultivating such pursuits; and the extent to which
what has been called the 'beautiful soul' (i.e. that nobler

and

transform the evil will into a semblance of goodness. Even if it cannot
alter the nature of evil, it can nevertheless make it appear to be good. For
every action has a positive aspect, and since the determination of good as
opposed to evil can likewise be reduced to the positive, I can maintain that
my action is good with reference to my intention. Thus, evil is connected
with good not only within the consciousness, but also in its positive aspect.
If the self-consciousness passes its action ofT as good only for the benefit
of other people, it takes the form of hypocrisy; but if it is able to assert that
the deed is good in its own estimation, too, we have reached that even
higher level of subjectivity which knows itself as absolute. For subjectivity
of this kind, good and evil in and for themselves have disappeared, and it
can pass off as good or evil whatever its wishes and its ability dictate. This
is the point of view of absolute sophistry which sets itself up as a legislator
and refers the distinction between good and evil to its own arbitrary will .
As for hypocrisy, this includes above all those religious hypocrites (or
TartufTes) who comply with all ceremonial requirements and may even be
pious in themselves ffiir siehl, while at the same time doing whatever they
please. Nowadays, there is no longer much talk of hypocrites, partly
because this accusation appears too harsh, and partly because hypocrisy in
its immediate shape has more or less disappeared. This barefaced lie and
cloak of goodness has now become too transparent not to be seen
through, and the distinction between doing good on the one hand and evil
on the other is no longer present to the same extent since increasing
education has made such antithetical determinations seem less clear-cut.
Instead, hypocrisy has now assumed the subtler guise [Gestalt] ofprobabil­
ism, which consists in the attempt to represent a transgression as some­
thing good from the point of view of one's own conscience. This can only
occur where morality and goodness are determined by an authority, so
that there are as many reasons as there are authorities for maintaining that
evil is good. Casuistic theologians, especially Jesuits, have worked on
these cases of conscience and endlessly multiplied them.
As these cases are refined to the highest pitch of subtlety, numerous
collisions arise, and the antithesis of good and evil becomes so blurred
that, in individual instances, the opposite poles prove interchangeable. All
that is asked for is probability, that is, an approximation to goodness which
can be substantiated by some reason or by some authority. Thus, this
point of view has the peculiar determination of possessing only an abstract
content; the concrete content is presented as inessential - or rather, it is

allowed to depend on mere opinion. In this way, someone may have
committed a crime while willing the good. If, for example, an evil man is
murdered, the assertion that the murderer wished to resist evil and to
diminish it can be passed off as the positive aspect [of the deed]. The next
step beyond probabilism is that it is no longer someone else's authority or
assertion that counts, but the subject itself, i.e. its OWII conviction, which
can a/aile make something good. The inadequacy of this is that everything
is made to refer solely to conviction, and that there is no longer any right
which has being in and for itself, a right for which this conviction would
merely be the form. It is not, of course, a matter of indifference whether I
do something from habit or custom or because I am thoroughly persu­
aded of its truth. But objective truth is also different from my conviction,
for the latter makes no distinction whatsoever between good and evil;
conviction always remains conviction, and the bad can only be that of
which I am not convinced. While this point of view is that of a supreme
instance which obliterates good and evil, it at the same time acknowledges
that it is subject to error, and to this extent, it is brought down from its
exalted position and again becomes contingent and appears to deserve no
respect. Now this form is iroll)" the consciousness that such a principle of
conviction is of little value and that, within this supreme criterion, only
arbitrariness prevails. This point of view was in fact a product of Fichte's
philosophy, which maintains that the 'I' is absolute, i.e. that it is absolute
certainty, the universal selfhood [Iellheit] whose further develdpment
leads to objectivity.1! It cannot in fact be said of Fichte that he nfade the
arbitrary will of the subject into a principle in the practical sphere, but this
[principle of the] particular, in the sense of Friedrich von Schlegel's
'particular selfhood', was itself later elevated to divine status in relation to
the good and the beautiful. This implies that objective goodness is merely
something constructed by my conviction, sustained by me alone, and that
I, as lord and master, can make it come and go [as I please]. As soon as I
relate myself to something objective, it ceases to exist for me, and so I am
poised above an immense void, conjuring up shapes and destroying them.
This supremely subjective point of view can arise only in a highly
cultivated age in which faith has lost its seriousness, which now exists
essentially only in the vanity of all things.

TRANSITION FROM MORALITY TO ETHICAL LIFE

§ I4I
For the

good as the substantial universal of freedom, but still as
abstract, determinations of some kind are therefore

something

required, as is a determining principle (although this principle is idetl­
tical with the good itself). For the C01lscietlce likewise, as the purely
abstract principle of determination, it is required that its determina­
tions should be universal and objective. Both of them [i.e. the good
and the conscience], if raised in this way to independent totalities

siclz zur Totalitiit],

become the indeterminate which

ought

[fiir

to be

determined. - But the integration of th·ese two relative totalities into

i1l itself, since this
self-certaimy, melting away for itself in its
emptiness, is ide1ltical with the abstract u1liversality of the good; the
identity - which is accordingly C01lcrete - of the good and the subjec­
tive will, the truth of them both, is ethical ljft.
absolute identity has already been accomplished

very subjectivity of pure

A conceptual transition of this kind can be understood more
fully with the help of logic. Here, it need only be said that the
nature of the limited and the finite - which in this case are the
abstract good which merely ought to be, and an equally abstract
subjectivity which merely ought to be good

-

is for them to have

withi1l them, the good its actuality, and
subjectivity (the moment of the actuality of the ethical) the
good; but since they are one-sided, they are not yet posited as
what they are i1l themselves. They become posited in their
negativity, for as they o1le-sidedly constitute themselves as
their opposite present

independent totalities, both refusing to accept what is present

i1l itself within

them - the good lacking subjectivity and

determination, and the determinant, i.e. subjectivity, lacking

[siclz
atif/zebetl] and are thereby reduced to moments, to moments of
the concept which becomes manifest as their unity and has
attained reality through this very positing of its moments, so
that it now exists as Idea; this is the concept which has devel­

what has being in itself - they cancel themselves out

oped its determinations to reality and which is simultaneously
present in their identity as their essence

1 85

which has bei1lg in

Philosophy ojRight
itself.

[Dasein] of freedom which was
right is determined in the reflection of
self-consciousness as the good; the third stage, present here il.
-

That existence

immediately present as

its transition as the truth of this good and of subjectivity, is
therefore also the truth of subjectivity and of right. - The

ethical is

a subjective disposition, but of that right which has

being in itself. That this Idea is the

tntth

of the concept of

freedom cannot be assumed or derived from feeling or from
any other source, but, in philosophy, can only be

proved.

Its

deduction consists solely in the fact that right and the moral
self-consciousness can be seen in themselves to return to this
Idea as their own result.

-

Those who think they can dispense

with proofs and deductions in philosophy show that they are
still far from forming the least idea of what philosophy is; they
may well speak on other matters, but those who wish to speak
without the concept have no right to participate in philosophi­
cal discourse.

Addition (H).

Both principles which we have so far considered, the
abstract good and the conscience, lack their opposite: the abstract good
evaporates into a complete powerlessness which I can endow with any
content whatsoever, and subjectivity of spirit becomes no less

impoverished in that it lacks any objective significance. A longing may
therefore arise for an objective condition, a condition in which the human
being gladly debases himself to servitude and total subjection simply in
order to escape the tonnent of vacuity and negativity. If many Protestants
have recendy gone over to the Catholic Church,! they have done so

1111
"I'

because they found that their inner life was impoverished, and they
reached out for a fixed point, a support, and an authority, even if what
they gained was not exacdy the stability of thought. The unity of the
subjective with the objective good which has being in and for itself is

ethical lift, and the reconciliation which takes place in it is in accord with
the concept. For whereas morality is the fonn of the will in general in its
subjective aspect, ethical life is not just the subjective fonn and self­
determination of the will: it also has its own concept, namely freedom, as
its content. The sphere of right and that of morality cannot exist
independendy ffiir siehl; they must have the ethical as their support and
foundation. For right lacks the moment of subjectivity, which in turn
belongs solely to morality, so that neither of the two moments has any
independent actuality. Only the infinite, the Idea, is actual. Right exists

§ 1 42
Ethical life is the Idea offreedom as the living good which has its
knowledge and volition in self-consciousness, and its actuality
through self-conscious action. Similarly, it is in ethical being that self­
consciousness has its motivating endI and a foundation which has
being in and for itself. Ethical life is accordingly the concept offreedom

which has become the existing [vorha7Idene1l] world and the 1lature of
self-conscious1less.

Since this unity of the concept of the will with its existence [Dasei71],
i.e. with the particular will, is knowledge, consciousness of the dif­
ference between these moments of the Idea is present, but in such a
way that each of these moments has become for itself the totality of
the Idea and has the latter as its foundation and content.

(a) The objective sphere of ethics, which takes the place of the
abstract good, is substance made concrete by subjectivity as i7zfinite
form. It therefore posits disti1laio1ls within itself which are thus
determined by the concept. These distinctions give the ethical a fixed
C01ltrot which is necessary for itself, and whose existence [Bestehro] is
exalted above subjective opinions and preferences: they are laws a1ld

institutions which have being in a1ldfor themselves.
Addition (H). In ethical life as a whole, both objective and subjective
moments are present, but these are merely its forms. Its substance is the
good, that is, the fulfilment of the objective [united] with subjectivity. If
we consider ethical life from the objective point of view, we may say that
ethical man is unconscious of him elf. In this sense, Antigone proclaims
that no one knows where the laws come from: they are eternal. I That is,
their determination has being in and for itself and issues from the nature
of the thing [Sache]. But this substantial element is also endowed with
consciousness, although the status of the latter is always only that of a
moment.

tal to them - these powers have their representation

Addition (H). Since the determinations of ethics constitute the concept of
freedom, they are the substantiality or universal essence of individuals,
who are related to them merely as accidents. Whether the individual
exists or not is a matter of indifference to objective ethical life,.which
alone has permanence and is the power by which the lives of individuals
are governed. Ethical life has therefore been represented to nations as
eternal justice, or as gods who have being in and for themselves, and in
relation to whom the vain pursuits of individuals are merely a play of the
waves.a

aTranslator's note: Ein anwogendes Spiel, literally 'an upward-surging play'. The word
anwogendes, perhaps a reminiscence of Goethe's poem 'Grenzen der Menschheit'

(,Limitations of Mankind'), I which likens man, in contrast to the gods, to an evanescent
phenomenon borne upwards by, then sinking beneath, the waves, is Dot found in
Hotho's transcription of Hegel's lectures, from which Gans compiled this Addition (see
VPR III, 485). It was therefore presumably added by Gans himself.

authority of ethical laws is infinitely higher, because natural
things [Naturdinge] display rationality only in a completely
external and fragmented manner and conceal it under the guise
[Gestalt] of contingency.

On the other hand, they are not something alien to the subject. On the

contrary, the subject bears spiritual witness to them as to its 0lV1l essence,
in which it has its

development of the circle of ethical necessity which follows
here in

Part Three of the

work.2 The difference between its

presentation here and the form of a

theory ofduties lies solely in

the fact that the following account merely shows that ethical
determinations are necessary relations, and does not proceed
to add in every case 'this determination is therefore a duty for
human beings'. - A theory of duties, unless it forms part of

reasons in favour of each duty, it may also adduce the further
consequences which this duty may have with reference to
other ethical relations and to welfare and opinion. But an
immanent and consistent theory of duties can be nothing
other than the development of those relations which are neces­
sitated by the Idea of freedom, and are therefore adual in their
entirety, within the state.

minate good. The individual, however, finds his

liberation in duty. On

the one hand, he is liberated from his dependence on mere natural
drives, and from the burden he labours under as a particular subject
in his moral reflections on obligation and desire; and on the other
hand, he is liberated from that indeterminate subjectivity which does

within itself and has no actuality. In duty, the individual

Addition (H).

Duty places limits only on the arbitrary will of subjectivity
and clashes only \vith that abstract good to which subjectivity clings.
When people say that they want to be free, this means primarily only that
they want to be free in an abstract sense, and every determination and
division [Gliedenmg] within the state is regarded as a limitation of that
freedom.! To this extent, duty is not a limitation of freedom, but only of

freedom in the abstract, that is, of unfreedom: it is the attainment of
essential being, the acquisition of affinnative freedom.

The ethical, in so far as it is reflected in the naturally determined
character of the individual as such, is

universal quality which may be required of him partly by right

and partly by ethics. But from the point of view of morality,

rectitude can easily appear as something of a lower order,
beyond which one must impose further demands on oneself
and others. For the craving to be something special [Besonderes]

can easily verge on empty declamation, because it refers only

to something abstract and indeterminate; and such talk, with
its reasons and descriptions

[Darstelltmgen], is directed at the

individual as arbitrary will and subjective caprice. Within a
given ethical order whose relations are fully developed and
actualized,

virtue in the proper sense has its place and actuality

only in extraordinary circumstances, or where the above rela­
tions come into collision. But such

collisions must be genuine

ones, for moral reflection can invent collisions for itself
wherever it likes and so give itself a consciousness that some­
thing

special [Besonderem]

is involved and that

sacrifices

have

been made.! This is why the form of virtue as such appears
more frequently in uncivilized societies and communities, for

1 93

Philosophy ofRight
in such cases, the ethical and its actualization depend more on
individual discretion and on the distinctive natural genius of
individuals. In this way, the ancients ascribed virtue to
Hercules in particular.2 And since, in the states of antiquity,
ethical life had not yet evolved into this free system of self­
sufficient development and objectivity, this deficiency had to
be made good by the distinctive genius of individuals. - If the
theory [Lehre] of virtues is not just a theory of duties and thus
includes the particular aspects of character which are
determined by nature, it will therefore be a lIatural history of

spirit.

II

!!

Since virtues are the ethical in its particular application,
and since, in this subjective respect, they are indeterminate,
the quantitative principle of more or less will play a part in
their determination.3 Discussion of them will therefore
involve those defects or vices which are opposed to them, as in
Aristotle, who judiciously defined each particular virtue as a
mean between an excess and a deficietlcy. - The same content
which assumes the form of duties and then of virtues also takes
the form of drives (see Remarks to § 1 9). Their basic content is
the same, but in drives, this content still belongs to the
inImediate will and to natural sensation and has not developed
far enough to attain the determination of the ethical. Drives
therefore have in common with the content of duties and
virtues only their abstract object [Gegetlstalld], and since this is
indeterminate in itself, it cannot serve to distinguish them as
good or evil. Alternatively, if we abstract their positive aspect
from them, they are good, and conversely, if we abstract their
negative aspect, they are evil (see § I S).

Additioll (H,G). If this or that particular action of a person is ethical, this

does not exactly make him virtuous; it does so only if this mode of conduct
is a constant feature of his character. Virtue consists rather in ethical
virtuosity, and if we speak less about virtue nowadays than before, the
reason [G17l1ldJ is that the ethical is no longer so much the form of a
particular individual. The French, above all, are the people who speak
most ofvirtue, because with them, the individual is characterized more by
his distinctive qualities and by a natural mode of behaviour. The Ger­
mans, on the other hand, are more thoughtful, and in their case, the same
content acquires the form of universality.
1 94

Ethical Life

§§

But if it is simply identical with the actuality of individuals, the ethical
[das Sittliche], as their general mode of behaviour, appears as custom
[Sitte]; and the habit of the ethical appears as a second 1lature which
takes the place of the original and purely natural will and is the all­
pervading soul, significance, and actuality of individual existence
[Dasei1l]. It is spirit living and present as a world, and only thus does
the substance of spirit begin to exist as spirit.

Addition (H,G). Just as nature has its laws, and as animals, trees, and the

sun obey their law, so is custom the law appropriate to the spirit of
freedom. Custom is what right an!i morality have not yet reached, namely
spirit. For in right, particularity is not yet that of the concept, but only of
the natural will. Similarly, from the point of view of morality, self-con­
sciousness is not yet spiritual consciousness. At this stage, it is merely a
question of the value of the subject in itself - that is, the subject which
detennines itself in accordance with good as opposed to evil stiI1 has the
form of arbitrary will. Here, on the other hand, at the level of ethics, the
will is present as the will of spirit and has a substantial content which is in
conformity with itself. Education [Piidagogik] is the art of making human
beings ethical: it considers them as natural beings and shows them how
they can be reborn, and how their original nature can be transformed into
a second, spiritual nature so that this spirituality becomes lzabitllal to
them. In habit, the opposition between the natural and the subjective will
disappears, and the resistance of the subject is broken; to this extent,
habit is part of ethics, just as it is part of philosophical thought, since the
latter requires that the mind [der Geist] should be trained to resist arbi­
trary fancies and that these should be destroyed and overcome to clear the
way for rational thought. Human beings even die as a result of habit - that
is, if they have become totally habituated to life and mentally fgeistig] and
physically blunted, and the opposition between subjective consciousness
and mental activity has disappeared. For they are active only in so far as
they have not yet attained something and wish to assert themselves and
show what they can do in pursuit of it. Once this is accomplished, their
activity and vitality disappear, and the loss of interest which ensues is
mental or physical death.

In this way, ethical substatztiality has attained its right, and the latter has
attained validity. That is, the self-will of the individual [des Ei1lzel1le1l],

1 95

1 50-152

Philosophy ofRight
and his own conscience in its attempt to exist for itself and in opposi­
tion to the ethical substantiality, have disappeared; for the ethical
character knows that the end which moves irl is the universal which,
though itself unmoved, has developed through its determinations into
actual rationality, and it recognizes that its own dignity and the whole
continued existence [Bestehen] of its particular ends are based upon
and actualized within this universal. Subjectivity is itself the absolute
form and existent actuality of substance, and the difference between
the subject on the one hand and substance as its object [Gegenstand],
end, and power on the other is the same as their difference in form,
both of which differences have disappeared with equal immediacy.
Subjectivity, which is the ground in which the concept of
freedom has its existence [Existenz] (see § 106), and which, at
the level of morality, is still distinct from this its own concept,
is, in the ethical realm, that [mode of] existence of the concept
which is adequate to it.

The right of individuals to their subjective detemzinati01z to freedom is
fulfilled in so far as they belong to ethical actuality; for their certainty
of their own freedom has its truth in such objectivity, and it is in the
ethical realm that they actually possess their own essence and their
inner universality (see § 147).

When a father asked him for advice about the best way of
educating his son in ethical matters, a Pythagorean replied:
'Make him the citizen ofa state with good laws.' (This saying has
also been attributed to others/

Addition (H). Those pedagogical experiments in removing people from
the ordinary life of the present and bringing them up in the country (cf.
Rousseau's Emile) have been futile, because one cannot successfully iso­
late people from the laws of the world.2 Even if young people have to be
educated in solitude, no one should imagine that the breath of the
spiritual world will not eventually find its way into this solitude and that
the power of the world spirit is too weak for it to gain control of such
remote regions. The individual attains his right only by becoming the
citizen of a good state.

196

Ethical Life

§§ I 5 2-I 57

The right of individuals to their particularity is likewise contained in
ethical substantiality, for particularity is the mode of outward
appearance in which the ethical exists.

§ I SS
Hence duty and right coincide i n this identity of the universal and the
particular will, and in the ethical realm, a human being has rights in so
far as he has duties, and duties in so far as he has rights. In abstract
right, I have the right and someone else has the corresponding duty;
and in morality, it is merely an obligation that the right of my own
knowledge and volition, and of my welfare, should be united with my
duties and exist objectively.

Addition (H). The slave can have no duties; only the free human being has
these. If all rights were on one side and all duties on the other, the whole
would disintegrate, for their identity is the only basis we have to hold on to
here.

§ 1 56
The ethical substance, as containing self-consciousness which has
being for itself and is united with its concept, is the aaual spirit of a
family and a people.

Additi01I (H).

The ethical is not abstract like the good, but is intensely
actual. The spirit has actuality, and the individuals are its accidents.
Thus, there are always only two possible viewpoints in the ethical realm:
either one starts from substantiality, or one proceeds atomistically and
moves upward from the basis of individuality [Ei7lZelheit]. This latter
viewpoint excludes spirit, because it leads only to an aggregation, whereas
spirit is not something individual [11ichts Einzebles] but the unity of the
individual and the universal.

The concept of this Idea has being only as spirit, as self-knowledge
and actuality, because it is the objectivization of itself, the movement
through the form of its moments. It is therefore

immediate or 1zatural ethical spirit - the fomily.
This substantiality passes over into loss of unity, division, and the
point of view of relativity, and is thus
civil society, i.e. an association of members as self-sufficient individu­
als [Einzebzer] in what is therefore a fomlal universality, occasioned
by their needs and by the legal constitution as a means of security for
persons and property, and by an external order for their particular
and common interests.
This external state
withdraws and comes to a focus in the end and actuality of the
substantial universal and of the public life which is dedicated to
this - i.e. in the constitution of the state.

The Family

§ 1 58
The family, as the immediate sztbstantiality of splOt, has as its
determination the spirit's feeling [Empfindullg] of its own unity, which
is love. Thus, the disposition [appropriate to the family] is to have self­
consciousness of one's individuality within this unity as essentiality
which has being in and for itself, so that one is present in it not as an
independent person [eine Person for siehl but as a member.

Addition (H,G). Love means in general the consciousness of my unity with
another, so that I am not isolated on my own ffiir michl, but gain my self­

consciousness only through the renunciation of my independent existence
[meitles FiirsiclzseillS] and through knowing myself as the unity of myself
with another and of the other with me. But love is a feeling [Empfind!mg],
that is, ethical life in its natural form. In the state, it is no longer present.
There, one is conscious of unity as law; there, the content must be
rational, and I must know it. The first moment in love is that I do not wish
to be an independent person in my own right ffiir miclz] and that, if! were,
I would feel deficient and incomplete. The second moment is that I find
myself in another person, that I gain recognition in this person [dajJ iclz in
ilzr gelte] , who in tum gains recognition in me. Love is therefore the most
immense contradiction; the understanding cannot resolve it, because
there is nothing more intractable than this punctiliousness of the self­
consciousness which is negated and which I ought nevertheless to possess
as affirmative. Love is both the production and the resolution of this
contradiction. As its resolution, it is ethical unity.

1 99

Philosophy ojRight

The right which belongs to the individual [dem Einzelnen] by virtue of
the family unit and which consists primarily in his life within this unit
takes on legal fonTZ [die Ponn Reelltens], as the abstract moment of
detenTziTlate individuality [Ei1lzelheit], only when the family begins to
dissolve. In this situation, those who ought to be members [of the
family] become, in their disposition and actuality, like self-sufficient
persons, and they now receive separately and in a purely external
manner - [in the shape of] financial resources, food, costs of educa­
tion [Emiehung], etc. - what was formerly their due as a determinate
moment within the family.

Addition (G). The right of the family properly consists in the fact that its
substantiality should have existence [Dasehl]. It is thus a right against
externality and against defection from the family unit. On the other hand,
love is itself a feeling [Empji1zdll1lg], subjective in character, and unity
cannot assert itself against it. Thus, if unity is required, it can be required
only With reference to those things [Dhzge] which are by nature external
and not conditioned by feeling.

§ I 60
The family attains completion in these three respects:
(a) in the shape of its immediate concept, as marriage;
(b) in external existence [Dasein], as the property and assets of the
family and their administration;
(c) in the bringing up of children and the dissolution of the family.

A. Marriage
§ I6I
Marriage, as the immediate ethical relationship, contains first the
moment of natural vitality; and since it is a substantial relationship,
this involves life in its totality, namely as the actuality of the species
[Gatttmg]a and its process (see Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical
"Tratls/alor's nole: In

this context of marriage and the family, the word Gallllng (genus,
species) carries with it strong overtones of the closely related word Regallllng (mating,
copulation). Hegel, who habitually e:l:ploits such et}mologicai relationships, is doubtless
aware of this affinity.

200

Ethical Life

§§ 1 5 9-162

Sciences, § § I 67ff. and 288ffV But secm/dly, in self-consciousness, the
U1li01l of the natural sexes, which was merely i1lward (or had being only
i1l itself) and whose existence [Existe1lz] was for this very reason merely
external, is transformed into a spiritual union, into self-conscious love.
Additioll (G). Marriage is essentially an ethical relationship. Formerly,
especially under most systems of natural law, it was considered only in its
physical aspect or natural character. It was accordingly regarded only as a
sexual relationship, and its other determinations remained completely
inaccessible.2 But it i� equally crude to interpret marriage merely as a civil
contract, a notion [Vorstelltmg] which is still to be found even in Kant.J On
this interpretation, marriage gives contractual form to the arbitrary rela­
tions between individuals, and is thus debased to a contract entitling the
parties concerned to use one another. A third and equally unacceptable
notion is that which simply equates marriage with love; for love, as a
feeling [Empfil/dtwg], is open in all respects to contingency, and this is a
shape which the ethical may not assume.4 Marriage should therefore be
defined more precisely as rightfully ethical [rech/liell sit/lielle] love, so that
the transient, capricious, and purely subjective aspects of love are
excluded from it.

§ 1 62
The subjective origin of marriage may lie to a greater extent in the
particular i1lC/itlatio1l of the two persons who enter this relationship, or
in the foresight and initiative of parents, etc. But its objective origin is
the free consent of the persons concerned, and in particular their
consent to cotlstitute a sillgle persOtl and to give up their natural and
individual personalities within this union. In this respect, their union
is a self-limitation, but since they attain their substantial self-con­
sciousness within it, it is in fact their liberation.
To enter the state of marriage is an objective determination,
and hence an ethical duty. The external origin of a given
marriage is by nature contingent, and depends in particular on
the level of development [Bildtmg] of reflective thought
[Rejlexio1l]. At one extreme, the initial step is taken by well­
intentioned parents, and when the persons destined to be
united in love get to know each other as destined partners, a
mutual inclination results. At the other extreme, it is the
mutual inclination of the two persons, as these infinitely parti20I

cularized

individuals, which arises first. - The former

extreme, or any way at all in which the decision to marry
comes first and is followed by the inclination so that the two
come together in the actual marital union, can itself be
regarded as the more ethical course. - In the latter extreme, it
is

it/fillitely partiClllar

distinctness

[Eigetltiimlicllkeit]

which

asserts its claims; this is associated with the subjective
principle of the modem world (see Remarks to § 1 24 above).
- But in those modem dramas and other artistic presentations
in which love between the sexes is the basic interest, we
encounter a pervasive element of frostiness which is brought
into the heat of the passion such works portray by the total

cot/tillgetlcy

associated with it. For the whole interest is

represented as resting solely upon

these particular individuals.

This may well be of infinite importance for them, but it is of no
such importance

ill itself.!

Additioll

(H). Among those peoples who hold the female sex in little
respect, the parents arrange marriages arbitrarily, without consulting the
individuals concerned; the latter accept this arrangement, since the par­
ticularity of feeling [Empfindtmgj makes no claims for itself as yet. The
girl's only concern is to find a husband, and the man's to find a wife.
Under other circumstances, considerations of wealth [des Vermiigetlsj,
connections, or political ends may determine the outcome. This may have
very harsh effects, inasmuch as marriage is made a means to other ends.
In modern times, on the other hand, the subjective origin [of marriagej,
the state o/being in love, is regarded as the only important factor. Here, it is
imagined that each must wait until his hour has struck, and that one can
give one's love only to a specific individual.

The

ethical aspect

of marriage consists in the consciousness of this

union as a substantial end, and hence in love, trust, and the sharing of
the whole ofindividual existence

[Existetlz]. When this disposition and

actuality are present, the natural drive is reduced to the modality of a
moment of nature which is destined to be extinguished in its very
satisfaction, while the spiritual bond asserts

its rights as the substantial

factor and thereby stands out as indissoluble ill itselfand exalted above
the contingency of the passions and of particular transient caprice.

202

Ethical Lift
It was noted above (§ 7 5) that marriage is not a contractual
relationship as far as its essential basis is concerned. For the

precise nature of marriage is to begin from the point of view of
contract - i.e. that of individual personality as a self-sufficient

unit -

ill order to supersede it [ihll auft;uhebell]. That identifica­

tion of personalities whereby the family is a sillgle persOIl and its

members are its accidents (although substance is essentially

the relationship of accidents to itself - see Ellcyclopaedia ofthe
Philosophical Sciences, § 95) 1 is the ethical spirit. Taken by
itself [/lir sich] - i.e. stripped of the many external features it
possesses by virtue of its existence [Daseill] in these individuals
and in those interests of [the realm of] appearance which are

determined in time and in various different ways - and viewed

in a shape appropriate to representational thought, this spirit
has been venerated as the

this spirit that the

Penates etc.;
religious character

and in general it is in
of marriage and the

family, i.e. piety, is embodied.2 It is a further abstraction if the
divine and substantial is separated from its existence

[Daseill]
[Empfilldtmg] and the consciousness
categorized [fixiert] as what is falsely

in such a way that feeling
of spiritual unity are
called

Platollic love.

This separation is associated with the

monastic attitude which defines the moment of natural life

[Lebendigkeit]

as utterly

llegative and,

by this very separation,

endows it with infinite importance in itself

[fiir sich].

Additioll (H,G). Marriage differs from cOIICllbillage inasmuch as the latter

is chiefly concerned with the satisfaction of the natural drive, whereas this
drive is made subordinate within marriage. This is why, within marriage,
one may speak unblushingly of natural functions which, in extra-marital
relationships, would produce a feeling of shame. But this is also why
marriage should be regarded as indissoluble ill itself, for the end of
marriage is the ethical end, which is so exalted that everything else
appears powerless against it and subject to its authority. Marriage should
not be disrupted by passion, for the latter is subordinate to it. But it is
indissoluble only ill itself, for as Christ says, divorce is permitted only
'because of the hardness of their hearts'.3 Since marriage contains the
moment of feeling [Emp.filldtmg], it is not absolute but unstable, and it has
within it the possibility of dissolution. But all legislations must make such
dissolution as difficult as possible and uphold the right of ethics against
caprice.

Just as the stipulation of a contract in itself

contains the

genuine transfer of property (see § 79), so also do the solemn declara­
tion of consent to the ethical bond ofmarriage and its recognition and

con­
church plays a part in this

confirmation by the family and community constitute the formal

clusion and actuality of marriage.

(That the

connection is a further determination which cannot be discussed
here.) It is accordingly only after this ceremony has first taken place, as

substantial [aspect of marriage] by means of the
sign - i.e. by means of language as the most spiritual existence
[Dasein] of the spiritual (see § 78) - that this bond has been ethically
the completion of the

constituted. The sensuous moment which pertains to natural life

[Lebendigkeit]

is thereby put in its ethical context

[Verhiiltnis]

as an

accidental consequence belonging to the external existence of the
ethical bond, which may even consist exclusively in mutual love and
support.
If, in order to establish or assess the legal determinations [of
marriage], it is asked what the

chief end of marriage is,

this

chief end will be understood to mean whatever individual
aspect of its actuality is to be regarded as more essential than
the others. But no one aspect on its own

[liir sich] constitutes

the whole extent of its content which has being in and for
itself - that is, of its ethical character - and one or other
aspect of its existence

[Existenz]

may be absent, without

prejudice to the essence of marriage. - If the

marriage as such - i.e.

conclusion of

the ceremony whereby the essence of

this bond is expressed and

confirmed as an ethical quality
contingency of feeling [Empfindung] and par­
ticular inclination - is seen as an external flmlality and a so­
called purely civil precept, nothing remains of this act except
perhaps the purpose [Zweck] of edification and of attesting the
exalted above the

�I
,<

civil relationship [of the marriage partners]. Or indeed, it is
the merely positive, arbitrary enactment of a civil or
ecclesiastical precept, which is not only indifferent to the
nature of marriage, but also - in so far as the emotions are
inclined by this precept to attach a value to the formal conclu­
sion [of marriage] and to regard it as a condition which must

204

Ethical Lift
be fulfilled before the partners can commit themselves totally
to each other - brings disunity into· the disposition of love
and, as an alien factor, runs counter to the inwardness of this
union. Although such an opinion claims to impart the highest
conception of the freedom, inwardness, and perfection of
love, it in fact denies the ethical character of love, that higher
suppression and subordination of mere natural drive which is
already naturally present in shame and which the more deter­
minate spiritual consciousness raises to chastity and purity
[Zucht]. More particularly, the view just referred to casts aside
the ethical determination [of marriage]. This consists in the
fact that the consciousness emerges from its naturalness and
subjectivity to concentrate on the thought of the substantial.
Instead of further reserving to itself the contingency and
arbitrariness of sensuous inclination, it removes the marriage
bond from this arbitrariness and, pledging itself to the
Penates, makes it over to the substantial; it thereby reduces
the sensuous moment to a merely conditional one - condi­
tioned, that is, by the true and ethical character of the rela­
tionship, and by the recognition of the marriage bond as an
ethical one. - It is impertinence and its ally, the understand­
ing, which cannot grasp the speculative nature of the substan­
tial relationship; but both the uncorrupted ethical emotions
[Gemiit] and the legislations of Christian peoples are in keep­
ing with this speculative nature.

Addition (G). Friedrich von Schlegel in his Ltlci1ltie and a follower ofhis in
the anonymous Letters (Lubeck and Leipzig, 1800) have argued that the
marriage ceremony is superfluous and a formality which could be dispen­
sed with, on the grounds that love is the substantial element and that its
value may even be diminished by this celebration. I These writers
represent the physical surrender as necessary in order to prove the
freedom and intensity of love - an argument with which seducers are not
unfamiliar. On the relations between man and woman, it should be noted
that a girl loses her honour in [the act of] physical surrender, which is not
so much the case with a man, who has another field of ethical activity
apart from the family. A girl's vocation [Bestimllltl1lgj consists essentially
only in the marital relationship; what is therefore required is that love

should assume the shape of marriage, and that the different moments
which are present in love should attain their truly rational relation to each
other.

§ 1 65
The 1latural determinacy of the two sexes acquires an illfellectual and
ethical significance by virtue of its rationality. This significance is
determined by the difference into which the ethical substantiality, as
the concept in itself, divides itself up in order that its vitality may
thereby achieve a concrete unity.

§ 1 66

"

The O1le [sex] is therefore spirituality which divides itself up into
personal self-sufficiency with being for itself and the knowledge and
volition of free u1liversality, i.e. into the self-consciousness of con­
ceptual thought and the volition of the objective and ultimate end.
And the other is spirituality which maintains itself in unity as know­
ledge and volition of the substantial in the form of concrete i1ldividu­
ality [Ei1lzelheit] andfteli1lg [ElIIpfi1ldtmg]. In its external relations, the
former is powerful and active, the latter passive and subjective. Man
therefore has his actual substantial life in the state, in learning [Wis­
se1lschaft], etc., and otherwise in work and struggle with the external
world and with himself, so that it is only through his division that he
fights his way to self-sufficient unity \vith himself. In the family, he
has a peaceful intuition of this unity, and an emotive [elllpfilldend] and
subjective ethical life. Woman, however, has her substantial vocation
[Bestillllllullg] in the family, and her ethical disposition consists in this
[family] pie(y.
In one of the most sublime presentations of piety - the Allfi­
g01le of Sophocles - this quality is therefore declared to be
primarily the law of woman, and it is presented as the law of
emotive [elllpfillde1ld] and subjective substantiality, of inward­
ness which has not yet been fully actualized, as the law of the
ancient gods and of the chthonic realm [des Uuterirdische1l] as
an eternal law of which no one knows whence it came, and in
opposition to the public law, the law of the state - an opposi­

Addition (H,G). Women may well be educated, but they are not made for
the higher sciences, for philosophy and certain artistic productions which
require a universal element.2 Women may have insights

[Einfolle], taste,

and delicacy, but they do not possess the ideal. The difference between
man and woman is the difference between animal and plant; the animal is
closer in character to man, the plant to woman, for the latter is a more
peaceful [process of] unfolding whose principle is the more indeterminate
unity of feeling

[Empfilldll1lg]. When women are in charge of government,

the state is in danger, for their actions are based not on the demands
of universality but on contingent inclination and opinion. The education
of women takes place imperceptibly, as if through the atmosphere of
representational thought, more through living than through the acquisi­
tion of knowledge

renders itself to this relationship, whose truth and inwardness (the

mutual and undivided surrender of this personality.] The latter attains
its right of being conscious of itself in the other only in so far as the

other is present in this identity as a person, i.e. as atomic individuality.
Marriage, and essentially monogamy, is one of the absolute
principles on which the ethical life of a community is based;
the institution of marriage is therefore included as one of the
moments in the foundation of states by gods or heroes.

§ I 68
Furthermore, since marriage arises out of the free

surrender by both
[e(gen] to
nattlrally identical

sexes of their personalities, which are infinitely unique
themselves, it must not be concluded within the

circle of people who are acquainted and familiar with each other in
every detail - a circle in which the individuals do not have a distinct
207

Philosophy ofRight
personality of their own in relation to one another - but must take
place [between people] from separate families and personalities of
different origin. Marriage between blood relations is therefore at
variance with the concept of marriage as an ethical act of freedom
rather than an association based on immediate natural existence
[Natiirlichkeit] and its drives, and hence it is also at variance with
genuine natural feeling [Empfindtmg].
If marriage itself is regarded as an arbitrary contract and as
grounded not in natural law but merely in the natural sexual
drive, and if external reasons for monogamy have been
derived even from the physical relation between numbers of
men and women, and obscure feelings have been cited as the
only reason for prohibiting marriage between blood relations,
such arguments are based on the common notion [Vorstellung]
of a state of nature and of the naturalness of right, and on the
absence of the concept of rationality and freedom.
In the first place, marriage between blood relations runs
counter even to the feeling [Giftihl] of shame, but this revulsion is justi­
fied by the concept of the thing [Sac/Ie]. In other words, what is already
united cannot then be united only by means of marriage. As far as the
purely natural relationship is concerned, it is well known that reproduc­
tion within a family of animals produces more feeble offspring, for what is
to be united must first be separate; the power of procreation, like that of
the spirit, increases with the magnitude of oppositions out of which it
reconstitutes itself. Familiarity, acquaintance, and the habit of shared
activity should not be present before marriage: they should be discovered
only within it, and the value of this discovery is all the greater the richer it
is and the more components it has.

The family, as a person, has its external reality in property; and only in

social life.

But the precise nature of these resources and the true method
of consolidating them become apparent within the sphere of
civil society.

§ 171
The family as a legal

[rechtliche] person in relation to others must be

represented by the husband as its head. In addition, he is primarily
responsible for external acquisition and for caring for the family's
needs, as well as for the control and administration of the family's
resources. These are common property, so that no member of the
family has particular property, although each has a right to what is
held in common. This right and the control of the resources by the
head of the family may, however, come into collision, because the
ethical disposition of the family is still immediate (see § I S8) and
exposed to particularization and contingency.

§ 1 72
When a marriage takes place, a new family is constituted, and this is
self-sufficient for itself in relation to the kinship groups or houses from
which it originated; its links with the latter are based on the natural
blood relationship, but the new family is based on ethical love. The
property of an individual is therefore also essentially connected with

20g

Philosophy ofRight
his marital relationship, and only more distantly connected with his
kinship group or house.

Marriage settlements which place

a restriction on the common

ownership by the partners of their goods, and measures which

ensure that the wife will continue to receive legal support,
etc., are significant inasmuch as they provide for the dissolu­

tion of the marriage in the event of natural death, divorce,

etc., and attempt to guarantee that, in such an eventuality, the

share of the various members of the family in the common

property will be preserved.

Addition (H). Many legal codes relate to the family in the wider sense and

.,

regard it as the essential bond, whereas the other bond which unites each
specific family appears less important in comparison. Thus, in older
Roman law, the wife in the less binding variety of marriage had a closer
relationship to her own kinsfolk than to her children and husband/ and in
the era of feudal law, the maintenance of the splendor fomiliae made it
necessary to count only the male members of the family as belonging to it
and to regard the family in its entirety as the most important factor,
whereas the newly constituted family disappeared from view. Neverthe­
less, every new family is more essential than the wider context of blood
relationships, and marriage partners and children form the proper
nucleus in opposition to what can also be described in a certain sense as
the family. The financial circumstances [Vennogetzsverhiiltnis] of individu­
als must therefore have a more essential connection with their marriage
than with the wider circle of their blood relations .

C. The Upbringing of Children and the Dissolution of the

Family

The

unity of marriage, which in substance is merely inwardness and
disposition but in existence [als existieretzd] is divided between the two
subjects, itself becomes in the children an existence [eine Existenz]
which has beingfor itself, and an object [Gegenstand] which they [i.e. the
parents] love as their love and their substantial existence [Dasehz]. From the point of view of nature, the presupposition of persons

existing

immediately - as parents - here becomes
210

the

result, a process

Ethical Life

§§ 1 7 2-1 7 4

which runs on into the infinite progression of generations which
produce and presuppose one another. This is the mode in which the
simple spirit of the Penates reveals its existence [Existenz] as a species
[Gattullg]a in the finite realm of nature.

Addition (H). The relation of love between man and wife is not yet an
objective one; for even if this feeling [Empfindllllg] is their substantial
unity, this unity does not yet possess objectivity [Gegenstiindlichkeit]. The
parents attain this unity only in their children, in whom they see the whole
of their union before them. In the child, the mother loves her husband
and he his wife; in it, they see their love before them. Whereas their unity
is present in their [shared] resources only as in an external thing [SadIe], it
is present in their children in a spiritual form in which the parents are
loved and which they love.
"Translalors nole: Compare note to § 161

above.

Children have a right to be brought up and supported at the expense of
the family. The right of the parents to their children's seroices, as
services, is based on and limited to the common concern of caring for
the family in general. In the same way, the right of the parents over
the arbitrary will of the children is determined by the end of bringing
them up and subjecting them to discipline. The end to which punish­
ments are directed is not justice as such; it is rather of a subjective and
moral nature, seeking to have a deterrent effect on a freedom which is
still entrammelIed in nature and to raise the universal into the child­
ren's consciousness and will.

Additioll (H). Human beings do not arrive by instinct at what they are

destined to become; on the contrary, they must attain this by their own
efforts. This is the basis of the child's right to its upbringing. The same
applies to peoples under paternal governments: they are fed out of central
depots and are not regarded as self-sufficient adults. The services which
may be required of children should therefore contribute solely to the end
of their upbringing; they must not claim to be justified in their own right
[fiir sidl], for the most unethical of all relationships is that in which
children are slaves.! One of the chief moments in a child's upbringing is
discipline, the purpose of which is to break the child's self-will in order to
eradicate the merely sensuous and natural. One should not imagine that
kindness alone is sufficient for this purpose; for it is precisely the immedi2II

Philosophy ojRight
ate will which acts according to immediate fancies and desires rather than
reasons and representations [Vorstellll1lgetl]. If one presents children with
reasons, it is left to them to decide whether to accept these or not, and
thus everything is made to depend on their caprice.2 The fact that the
parents constitute the universal and essential element entails the need for
obedience on the part of the children. Unless the feeling of subordina­
tion, which creates a longing to grow up, is nurtured in the children, they
become forward and impertinent.3

Children are free

in themselves, and their life is merely the immediate

of this freedom/ they therefore do not belong as

things [Sac/zm] either to others or to their parents. As far as their
relationship with the family is concerned, their upbringing has the
positive determination that, in them, the ethical is given the form of
immediate fieling [Empfindung] which is still without opposition, so
that their early emotional life may be lived in this [context], as the basis
of ethical life, in love, trust, and obedience. But in the same connec­
tion, their upbringing also has the

tions which most tarnishes the Roman legal code, and this
offence against the most vulnerable and innermost life of
ethics is one of the most important moments which enable us

to understand the world-historical character of the Romans
and their tendency towards legal formalism. - The need for
an upbringing is present in children as their own feeling of
dissatisfaction within themselves at the way they are - as the
drive to belong to the adult world whose superiority they
sense, or as the desire to grow up. The method of education
through play sees childishness itself as already inherently
valuable, presents it in this light to the children, and debases
serious things - and the method itself - to a childish form for
which the children themselves have little respect.2 By
representing children, in the immature state which they feel
they are in, as in fact mature, by endeavouring to make them

212

Ethical Life
satisfied with the way they are, this method distorts and
obscures the true need of the children themselves for some­
thing better; it creates in them on the one hand an indif­
ference towards, and imperviousness to, the substantial
relations of the spiritual world, and on the other a contempt
for people inasmuch as they have presented themselves to
them in a childish and contemptible light, and finally a vanity
and self-importance which revels in its own excellence.

Addition (H,G). As a child, the human being must have lived with his
parents in a circle oflove and trust, and the rational must appear in him as
his own most personal [eigC1lste] subjectivity. In the period of infancy, the
mother's role in the child's upbringing is of primary importance, for [the
principles of] ethics must be implanted in the child in the form of feeling
[Empfitldtmg]. It should be noted that, on the whole, children love their
parents less than their parents love them, for the children are increasingly
independent and gain in strength, thereby leaving their parents behind
them, whereas the parents possess in their children the objective and
concrete form [die objektive Gegetlstiitldlichkeit] of their union.

Marriage is still only the immediate [form of the] ethical Idea and thus
has its objective actuality in the inwardness of subjective disposition
and feeling [Empfindung]. This accounts for the basic contingency of
its existence [ExistC1lZ]. Just as there can be no compulsion to marry,
so also can there be no merely legal [reclztliclles] or positive bond which
could keep the partners together once their dispositions and actions
have become antagonistic and hostile. A third ethical authority is,
however, required in order to uphold the right of marriage - i.e. of
ethical substantiality - against the mere opinion that a hostile disposi­
tion is present, and against the contingency of merely transient
moods, etc., to distinguish these from total estrangement, and to
make sure that the partners are totally estranged before divorce is
granted.

Addition (H). Since marriage is based only on subjective and contingent
feeling, it may be dissolved. The state, on the other hand, is not subject to
partition, for it is based on law. Marriage certainly ought to be indis­
soluble, but this indissolubility remains no more than an obligation. Since,
however, marriage is an ethical institution, it cannot be dissolved by the
2 13

Philosophy ofRight
arbitrary will but only by an ethical authority, whether this be the Church
or a court of law. If a total estrangement has occurred - e.g. through
adultery - then even the religious authority must permit divorce.

The ethical dissolution of the family consists in the fact that the
children are brought up to become free personalities and, when they
have

come of age,

are recognized as legal

[reclltliche]

persons and as

capable both of holding free property of their own and of founding
their own families - the sons as heads of families and the daughters as
wives. In this family they now have their substantial determination,
and in relation to it, their original family recedes in importance as
merely their original basis and point of departure, while the abstract
category

[das Abstraktum] of the kinship group has even fewer rights.

The natural dissolution of the family through the death of the parents,
particularly of the husband, results in

inheritance

of the family's

resources. Inheritance is essentially a taking possession by the
individual as his own property of what

ill themselves

are common

resources - an acquisition which, in the case of more distant relation­
ships and with the increasing self-sufficiency of persons and families
as a result of the dispersal of civil society, becomes more indetermi­
nate as the disposition of unity declines and as every marriage leads to
the renunciation of previous family relationships and the establish­
ment of a new and self-sufficient family.
The notion

[Eillfollj that inheritance is based on the fact that,
ownerless property

by a person's death, his resources become

and as such accrue to the first person to take possession of

gellerally the relatives of the
usually closest at hand, who take

them, and that, since it is
deceased, as those who are

possession in this way, this common OCcurrence is then made
into a rule, for the sake of order, by positive legislation - this
notion disregards the nature of the family relationship. I

214

Ethical Life

§§ 1 7 6-180

The disintegration [of the family] leaves the arbitrary will of the
individual free either to expend his entire resources in accordance
with his caprices, opinions, and individual ends [Zwecke der Einzelheit],
or to regard a circle of friends, acquaintances, etc. so to speak as
taking the place of a family and to make a pronouncement to that
effect in a testament whereby they become his rightful heirs.
The formation [Bildzmg] of such a circle as would give the will
an ethical justification for disposing of resources in this way especially in so far as the very act of forming this circle has
testamentary implications - involves so much contingency,
arbitrariness, intent to pursue selfish ends, etc., that the ethi­
cal moment is extremely vague; and the recognition that the
arbitrary will is entitled to make bequests is much more likely
to lead to infringements of ethical relations and to base aspira­
tions and equally base attachments, and to provide an oppor­
tunity and justification for foolish arbitrariness and for the
insidious practice of attaching to so-called benefactions and
gifts vain and oppressively vexatious conditions which come
into effect after the benefactor's death, in which event his
property in any case ceases to be his.

§ 1 80
The principle that the members of the family become self-sufficient
and rightful persons (see § 1 77) allows something of this arbitrariness
and discrimination to arise within the family circle among the natural
heirs; but it must occur only on a very limited scale if the basic
relationship is not to be damaged.
The simple direct arbitrariness of the deceased cannot be
made the principle of the right to make a will, especially if it is
opposed to the substantial right of the family; for the love and
veneration of the family for its former member are primarily
the only guarantee that his arbitrary will will be respected after
his death. Such arbitrariness in itself contains nothing which
deserves greater respect than the right of the family itself - on
the contrary. Otherwise, the validity of a testamentary disposi215

Philosophy ofRight

tion would reside solely in its arbitrary recognition by others.1
But a validity of this kind can be admitted primarily only when
the family relationship of which the disposition fonus an
integral part grows more remote and ineffective. But ineffec­
tiveness in a family relationship, when the latter is actually
present, must be classed as unethical, and to extend the
validity of arbitrary dispositions at the expense of family rela­
tionships is implicitly to weaken the latter's ethical standing. To make this arbitrariness the main principle of inheritance
within the family was, however, part of that harsh and unethi­
cal aspect of Roman law referred to above, whereby a son
could even be sold by his father and, if he was given his
freedom by others, again came under his father's authority
[Gewalt] and did not actually become free until he had been
given his freedom for the third time.2 According to these laws,
the son never attained his majority de iure, nor did he become
a legal [rechtliche] person, and the spoils of war (peculium
castrense) were the only property which he could own;3 and if
he escaped from his father's authority by being sold and
liberated on three occasions in the manner described above,
he could not inherit along with those who remained in
servitude to the family unless he was expressly included in the
will. In the same way, a wife (in so far as she entered marriage
as a matron, and not as one who in manum cotlveniret, in
mancipio esset," as on entering a state of slavery) continued to
belong to the family from which she came, rather than to the
family which, by her marriage, she had in part founded and
which was now actually her own; and she was therefore debar­
red from inheriting the resources of those who were actually
her fo,mily, just as the latter could not inherit from their wife
and mother.4 - We have already noticed (see Remarks to § 3
above) how the unethical aspects of these and other such laws
[Rechte] were circumvented in the administration of justice,
e.g. with the help of the expression bonorum possessio instead of
hereditas, and through the fiction of giving a filia the desig­
nation filius (the fact that bononml possessio is in tum distinct
from possessio bonorum belongs to that kind of knowledge

[Ke1l11tl1issen] which characterizes the expert on legal mat­
ters).s This, as we noted, was the sad necessity to which the
judge had to resort, in the face of bad laws, in order to
smuggle rationality, by artfid means, into at least some of their
consequences. This was associated with the terrible instability
of the main institutions [of the state], and with a frantic
activity of legislation designed to counteract the outbreak of
evils [Ubel] which resulted from it. - The unethical conse­
quences which thjs right of arbitrariness in testamentary dis­
positions had among the Romans are familiar enough from
history, and from the accounts of Lucian and other writers.6 It lies in the nature of marriage itself, as the immediate [form
of] ethical life, that it is a mixture of substantial relationship,
natural contingency, and inner arbitrariness. If, then,
arbitrariness is given precedence over the right of the sub­
stantial as a result of the servitude of children and the other
determinations referred to above or associated with these, and
not least because divorce was easy to obtain in Rome - so that
even Cicero (and what fine things he has written about
honestum and decorum" in his De OfficiiI' and everywhere else
in his works!) could divorce his wife as a speculation in order
to pay his debts out of his new wife's dowry - then a legal way
is open to ethical corruption, or rather the laws make such
corruption inevitable.7
That institution of the law of inheritance which, in order to

preserve the family and to enhance its renown by means of
substitutiolls and family testamentary trusts,s either favours the
sons by excluding the daughters from inheritance or favours
the eldest son by excluding the remaining children (or allows
any other kind ofinequality to arise) on the one hand infringes
the principle of the freedom of property (see § 62), and on the
other depends on an arbitrariness which in and for itself has
no right to recognition - or more precisely, it depends on the
intention to uphold not so much this family, as this kinship
group or house. Not this house or kinship group, however, but
the family as such is the Idea which has this right [to recog­
nition], and freedom [to dispose] of resources and equality of

however, in an arbitrary manner, but as a necessary conse­
quence of the Idea of the state; but this will be dealt with later
(see

§ 3 06).

Additioll (H,G). In Rome, the father in earlier times could disinherit his
children, and could even kill them;9 later, this was no longer permitted.
Attempts were made to create a system out of this incongruity between
the unethical and its ethical adaptations, and it is adherence to this system
which constitutes the difficulty and inadequacy of our own law of
inheritance. Wills may certainly be permitted; but in allowing them to be
made, our point of view must be that this right of arbitrariness arises or
increases with the disintegration of the family and the distance between
its members; and the so-calledfomio, offrielldship which a will brings into
existence can arise only in the absence of the closer family of marriage
and children. Wills in general have a disagreeable and unpleasant aspect,
for in making my will, I identifY those for whom I have an affection. But
affection is arbitrary; it may be gained in various ways under false
pretences or associated with various foolish reasons, and it may lead to a
beneficiary being required to submit to the greatest indignities. In Eng­
land, where all kinds of eccentricity are endemic," innumerable foolish
notions are associated with wills.

§ § 1 80-1 8 1

TRANSITION FROM THE FAMILY TO CML S OCIETY

§ 181
The family disintegrates, in a natural manner and essentially through
the principle of personality, into a plurality of families whose relation
to one another is in general that of self-sufficient concrete persons
and consequently of an external kind. In other words, the moments
which are bound together in the unity of the family, as the ethical Idea
which is still in its concept, must be released from the concept to
[attain] self-sufficient reality. This is the stage of di.!fere1lce [D@re1lz].
To put it first in abstract terms, this gives the determination of
particularity which is related to universality, but in such a way that the
latter is its basis - though still only its imler basis; consequently, this
universality is present only as a formal appearance in the particular [auf
fonne/le, in das Besondere 1zur scllei1le1lde Weise]. This relation of reflec­
tion accordingly represents in the first instance the loss of ethical life;
or, since the latter, as the essence, necessarily appears (see
Encyclopaedia ofthe Philosophical Sciences, §§ 64ff. and 8 I ff.)/ this rela­
tion constitutes the world of appearance of the ethical, i.e. civil society.
The expansion of the family, as its transition to another
principle, is, in [the realm of] existence [Existe1lz], either a
peaceful expansion whereby it becomes a people or nation,
which thus has a common natural origin, or a coming together
of scattered family communities under the influence of a
dominant power or in a voluntary union prompted by inter­
dependent needs and their reciprocal satisfaction.
Additi01l (H). The point of departure of universality here is the self­

sufficiency of the particular, so that ethical life appears to be lost at this
level, for it is in fact the identity of the family which consciousness regards
as the primary, divine, and obligating factor. But a relation now arises
whereby the particular is to be my primary determining principle, and the
ethical determination is thereby superseded. But I am in fact simply
under a misapprehension, for while I believe that I am adhering to the
particular, the universal and the necessity of the [wider] context neverthe­
less remain the primary and essential factor. I am thus entirely on the
level of semblance, and while my particularity remains my determining
principle - that is, my end - I am thereby serving the universal which in
fact retains ultimate power over me.

Civil Society

,

I

The concrete person who, as a particular person, as a totality of needs
and a mixture of natural necessity and arbitrariness, is his own end, is

one principle of civil society. But this particular person stands essen­
tially in relation [Bezielltmg] to other similar particulars, and their
relation is such that each asserts itself and gains satisfaction through
the others, and thus at the same time through the exclusive

universality, which is the second principle.

Addition (H,G). Civil society is the [stage of] difference [Dijferenz] which
intervenes between the family and the state, even if its full development
[Ausbildtmg] occurs later than that of the state; for as difference, it presup­
poses the state, which it must have before it as a self-sufficient entity in
order to subsist [bestelzen] itself. Besides, the creation of civil society
belongs to the modem world, which for the first time allows all
determinations of the Idea to attain their rights. If the state is represented
as

a unity of different persons, as a unity which is merely a community [of

interests], this applies only to the determination of civil society. Many
modem exponents of constitutional law have been unable to offer any
view of the state but this. In civil society, each individual

is his own end,

and all else means nothing to him. But he cannot accomplish the full

extent of his ends without reference to others; these others are therefore
means to the end of the particular [person] . But through its reference to
others, the particular end takes on the form of universality, and gains
satisfaction by simultaneously satisfYing the welfare of others. Since par­
ticularity is tied to the condition of universality, the whole [of civil society]

is the sphere

[Boden] of mediation in which all individual characteristics

220

Ethical Life
[Einzelheiten], all aptitudes, and all accidents of birth and fortune are
liberated, and where the waves of all passions surge forth, governed only
by the reason which shines through them. Particularity, limited by univer­
sality, is the only standard by which each particular [person] promotes his
welfare.

The selfish end in its actualization, conditioned in this way by univer­
sality, establishes a system of all-round interdependence, so that the
subsistence [Subsistenz] and welfare of the individual [des Einzelnen]
and his rightful existence [Dasein] are interwoven with, and grounded
on, the subsistence, welfare, and rights of all, and have actuality and
security only in this context. - One may regard this system in the first
instance as the external state, the state of necessit/ and of the

understanding.

When it is divided in this way, the Idea gives a distitlct existence [Dasein]
to its moments - to partiCIIlarity it gives the right to develop and express
itselfin all directions, and to universality the right to prove itself both
as the ground and necessary form of particularity, and as the power
behind it and its ultimate end. - It is the system of ethical life, lost in
its extremes, which constitutes the abstract moment of the reality of
the Idea, which is present here only as the relative totality and imler
necessity of this external appearance.

Addition

(H). Here, the ethical is lost in its extremes, and the immediate
unity of the family has disintegrated into a plurality. Reality here is
externality, the dissolution of the concept, the self-sufficiency of its
liberated and existent moments. Although particularity and universality
have become separated in civil society, they are nevertheless bound up
with and conditioned by each other. Although each appears to do pre­
cisely the opposite of the other and imagines that it can exist only by
keeping the other at a distance, each nevertheless has the other as its
condition. Thus, most people regard the payment of taxes, for example, as
an infringement of their particularity, as a hostile element prejudicial to
their own ends; but however true this may appear, the particularity of their
own ends cannot be satisfied without the universal," and a country in

which no taxes were paid could scarcely distinguish itself in strengthening
its particular interests [Bes01zderlzeitJ. It might likewise appear that the
universal would do better to absorb the strength of the particular, as
described, for example, in Plato's Republic; but this again is only apparent,
for the two exist solely through and for one another and are transformed
into one another. In furthering my end, I further the universal, and this in
turn furthers my end.

Particularity in itself fjiir sidz], on the one hand indulging itself in all
directions as it satisfies its needs, contingent arbitrariness, and sub­
j ective caprice, destroys itself and its substantial concept in the act of
enjoyment; on the other hand, as infinitely agitated and continually
dependent on external contingency and arbitrariness and at the same
time limited by the power of universality, the satisfaction of both
necessary and contingent needs is itself contingent. In these opposites
and their complexity, civil society affords a spectacle of extravagance
and misery as well as of the physical and ethical corruption common
to both.
The self-sufficient development of particularity (cf. Remarks
to § 1 24) is the moment which appears in the states of the
ancient world as an influx of ethical corruption and as the
ultimate reason [Gnmd] for their downfall. These states, some
of which were based on the patriarchal and religious principle
and others on the principle of a more spiritual, though sim­
pler, ethical life, but all of which were based on original
natural intuition, could not withstand the division which arose
within the latter as self-consciousness became infinitely
reflected into itself. As this reflection began to emerge, first as
a disposition and then in actuality, they succumbed to it,
because the simple principle on which they were still based
lacked the truly infinite power which resides solely in that
unity which allows the opposition within reason [Vemunfi] to
develop to its full strength, and has overcome it so as to preserve
itself within it and wholly co1ltain it within itself. Plato, in his
Republic, presents the substance of ethical life in its ideal
beauty and truth; but he cannot come to terms with the
principle of self-sufficient particularity, which had suddenly
-

222

Ethical Lift
overtaken Greek ethical life in his time, except by setting up
his purely substantial state in opposition to it and completely
excluding it [from this state], from its very beginnings in
private property (see Remarks to § 4W and the fomifY to its
subsequent development [Ausbildtmg] as the arbitrary will of
individuals and their choice of social position [des Sta1ldes],
etc.3 This deficiency also explains why the great substatltial
truth of his Republic is imperfecdy understood, and why it is
usually regarded as a dream of abstract thought, as what is
indeed often called an ideal. The principle of the self-sufficiC1lt
a1ld i1lherC1ltly i1lfi1lite perso1lality of the individual [des
Ei1lzel1lC1l], the principle of subjective freedom, which arose in
an inward form in the Christia1l religion and in an external
form (which was therefore linked with abstract universality) in
the Romall world, is denied its right in that merely substantial
form of the actual spirit [in Plato's Republic]. This principle is
historically later than the Greek world, and the philosophical
reflection which can fathom these depths is likewise later than
the substantial Idea of Greek philosophy.

Additiol1 (H). Particularity in itself [flir siell] is boundless [ma)1los] extrava­
gance, and the forms of this extravagance are themselves boundless.
Through their representations [Vorstelltmgetl] and reflections, human
beings expand their desires, which do not form a closed circle like animal
instinct, and extend them to false [sellleellte] infinity. But on the other
hand, deprivation and want are likewise boundless, and this confused
situation can be restored to harmony only through the forcible interven­
tion of the state. Although Plato's state sought to exclude particularity,
this is of no help, because such help would contradict the infinite right of
the Idea to allow particularity its freedom. It was primarily in the
Christian religion that the right of subjectivity arose, along with the
infinity of being-for-itself; and in this situation, the totality must also be
endowed with sufficient strength to bring particularity into harmony with
the ethical unity.

§ I 86
But in the very act of developing itself independendy [fUr sich] to
totality, the principle of particularity passes over into u1liversality, and
only in the latter does it have its truth and its right to positive actuality.
This unity is not that of ethical identity, because at this level of

division (see § 1 84), the two principles are self-sufficient; and for the
same reason, it is present not as jreed{}m, but as the necessity whereby
the particular must rise to the jimll oJuniversality and seek and find its
subsistence in this form.

Individuals, as citizens of this state, are private persons who have their
own interest as their end. Since this end is mediated through the
universal, which thus appears to the individuals as a mearlS, they can
attain their end only in so far as they themselves determine their
knowledge, volition, and action in a universal way and make them­
selves links in the chain of this continuum [Zusammenhang]. In this
situation, the interest of the Idea, which is not present in the con­
sciousness of these members of civil society as such, is the process
whereby their individuality [Eillzelheit] and naturalness are raised,
both by natural necessity and by their arbitrary needs, toformaljreed{}m
and formal tmiversality oJ knowledge and volition, and subjectivity is

with the nature of spirit and with the end of reason. Spirit
attains its actuality only through internal division, by imposing
this limitation and finitude upon itselfin [the shape of] natural
needs and the continuum [Zusammenhallg] of this external

neither the natural ethical simplicity referred to above, nor, as
particularity develops, the pleasures as such which are
attained through education. Its end is rather to work to
eliminate natural simplicity, whether as passive selflessness or
as barbarism of knowledge and volition - i.e. to eliminate the
immediacy and individuality [Einzelheit] in which spirit is
immersed, so that this externality may take on the rationality of
which it is capable, namely the faml of universality or of the
understanding. Only in this way is the spirit at home and with
itself in this externality as such. Its freedom thus has an
existence [Dasein] within the latter; and, in this element
which, in itself, is alien to its determination of freedom, the
spirit becomes far itself, and has to do only with what it has
impressed its seal upon and produced itself. - By this very
means, the faml oftmiversality comes into existence [Existenz]
for itself in thought, the only form which is a worthy element
for the existence [Existenz] of the Idea. Education, in its
absolute determination, is therefore liberation and work
towards a higher liberation; it is the absolute transition to the
infinitely subjective substantiality of ethical life, which is no
longer immediate and natural, but spiritual and at the same
time raised to the shape of universality. Within the subject,
this liberation is the hard work of opposing mere subjectivity of
conduct, of opposing the immediacy of desire as well as the
subjective vanity of feeling [Empfindung] and the arbitrariness
of caprice. The fact that it is such hard work accounts for
some of the disfavour which it incurs. But it is through this
work of education that the subjective will attains objeaivity
even within itself, that objectivity in which alone it is for its
part worthy and capable of being the aauality of the Idea. Furthermore, this form of universality to which particularity
has worked its way upwards and cultivated [herauJiebildet]
itself, i.e. the form of the understanding, ensures at the same
time that particularity becomes the genuine bei11g-far-itself of
individuality [Einzelheit]; and, since it is from particularity that
universality receives both the content which fills it and its
infinite self-determination, particularity is itself present in
ethical life as free subjectivity which has infinite being-for2 25

is an immanent moment of the absolute, and that it has
infinite value.

By educated people, we may understand in the first place
those who do everything as others do it" and who do not flaunt their
particular characteristics [Partikularitat], whereas it is precisely these
characteristics which the uneducated display, since their behaviour is not
guided by the universal aspects of its object [Gegensta1ltij. Similarly, in his
relations with others, the uneducated man can easily cause offence, for he
simply lets himself go and does not reflect on the feelings [E1IIpfindtmgen]
of others. He does not wish to hurt others, but his conduct is not in
harmony with his will. Thus, education irons out particularity to make it
act in accordance with the nature of the thing [Sache]. True originality, by
which the [universaW thing is produced, requires true education, whereas
false originality assumes tasteless forms which occur only to the
uneducated.

226

Ethical Life
A. The System ofNeeds
§ 1 89
Particularity, in its primary detennination as that which is opposed to
the universal of the will in general (see § 60)," is subjective need, which
attains its objectivity, i.e. its satisfaction, by means of (a) external
things [Dinge], which are likewise the property and product of the
needs and wills of others and of (�) activity and work, as the mediation
between the two aspects. The end of subjective need is the satisfac­
tion of subjective particularity, but in the relation [Beziehung] between
this and the needs and free arbitrary will of others, universality asserts
itself, and the resultant manifestation [Scheinen] of rationality in the
sphere of finitude is the understanding. This is the chief aspect which
must be considered here, and which itself constitutes the conciliatory
element within this sphere.

Political economy is the science which begins with the above
viewpoints but must go on to explain mass relationships and
mass movements in their qualitative and quantitative
detenninacy and complexity. - This is one of the sciences
which have originated in the modem age as their element
[Boden]. The development of science is of interest in showing
how thought extracts from the endless multitude of details with
which it is initially confronted the simple principles of the
thing [Sac/Ie], the understanding which works within it and
controls it (see Smith, Say, and Ricardo).1 - To recognize, in
the sphere of needs, this manifestation [Scheinen] of rationality
which is present in the thing [Sache] and active within it has,
on the one hand, a conciliatory effect; but conversely, this is
also the field in which the understanding, with its subjective
ends and moral opinions, gives vent to its discontent and
moral irritation.

Additioll (H,G). There are certain universal needs, such as food, drink,
clothing, etc., and how these are satisfied depends entirely on contingent
circumstances. The soil is more or less fertile in different places, the years
a Translator's note: The first edition, and the Suhrkamp edition, refer to § 60, but Ilting's
edition refers to § 6, which makes much better sense (VPR II, 640). T. M. Knox's

are more or less productive, one man is industrious and the other lazy.
But this proliferation of arbitrariness generates universal determinations
from within itself, and this apparently scattered and thoughtless activity is
subject to a necessity which arises of its own accord. To discover the
necessity at work here is the object [Gegetlstatul] of political economy, a
science which does credit to thought because it finds the laws underlying
a mass of contingent occurrences. It is an interesting spectacle to observe
here how all the interconnections have repercussions on others, how the
particular spheres fall into groups, influence others, and are helped or
hindered by these. This interaction, which is at first sight incredible since
everything seems to depend on the arbitrary will of the individual [des
Eitzzelnetl], is particularly worthy of note; it bears a resemblance to the
planetary system, which presents only irregular movements to the eye, yet
whose laws can nevertheless be recognized.
a. The Nature of Needs and their Satisfaction
,�

§ I 90
by which the atlimal can satisfY its

The ways and means
needs are
limited in scope, and its needs are likewise limited. Though sharing
this dependence, the human beitlg is at the same time able to transcend
it and to show his universality, first by multiplying his needs and means
[of satisfYing them], and secondly by dividing and differentiating the
concrete need into individual parts and aspects which then become
different needs, particularized and hence more abstract.
In right, the object [Gegetlstand] is the person; at the level of
morality, it is the subject, in the family, the fomily-metnber, and
in civil society in general, the citizetl (in the sense of bourgeois).
Here, at the level of needs (cf. Remarks to § 1 23), it is that
concretum of representational thought which we call the human
being; this is the first, and in fact the only occasion on which
we shall refer to the human being in this sense.

Addition (H). The animal is a particular entity [ein Partikulares] which has

its instinct and the means of satisfYing it, means whose bounds cannot be
exceeded. There are insects which are tied to a specific plant, and other
animals whose sphere is wider and which can live in different climates;
but there is always a lizniting factor in comparison with the sphere which
is open to the human being. The need for food and clothing, the necessity
228

Ethical Life
of renouncing raw food and of making it fit to eat and destroj'ing its
patural immediacy, means that the human being's life is less comfortable
than thiitoffueanimal - as indeed it ought to be, since man is a spiritual
being. The understanding, which can grasp distinctions, brings multipli­
city into these needs; and shlce taste and utility become criteria of judge­
ment, the needs themselves are also affected by them. In the end, it is no
longer need but opinion which has to be satisfied, and it is a distinctive
feature of education that it resolves the concrete into its particulars. The
very multiplication of needs has a restraining influence on desire, for if
people make use of many things, the pressure to obtain any one of these
which they might need is less strong, and this is a sign that necessity [die
Not] in general is less powerful.
§ I9I

In the same way, the meallS employed by particularized needs, and in
general the ways in which these are satisfied, are divided and multiplied
so that they in tum become relative ends and abstract needs. It is an
infinite process of multiplication which is in equal measure a differl?1l­
tiatioll of these determinations and a judgeml?1lt on the suitability of the
means to their ends - i.e. [a process of] refilleml?1lt.
Addition (H). What the English call 'comfortable'· is something utterly
inexhaustible; its ramifications are infinite, for every comfort in tum
reveals its less comfortable side, and the resulting inventions are endless.
A need is therefore created not so much by those who experience it
directly as by those who seek to profit from its emergence.
"Translator's lzote: Hotho, on whose notes this Addition is based, cites this word in the
French form confortable, and makes no reference to the English (VP R 1Il, 593).

Needs and means, as existing in reality [als reeUes Daseill], become a
beillg [Seill] for others by whose needs and work their satisfaction is
mutually conditioned. That abstraction which becomes a quality of
both needs and means (see § 1 9 1 ) also becomes a determination of
the mutual relations [Beziehwzg] between individuals. This univer­
sality, as the quality of beillg recognized, is the moment which makes
isolated and abstract needs, means, and modes of satisfaction into
cOllcrete, i.e. social ones.

Addition (H). The fact that I have to fit in with other people brings the

fonn of universality into play at this point. I acquire my means of satisfac­
tion from others and must accordingly accept their opinions. But at the
same time, I am compelled to produce means whereby others can be
satisfied. Thus, the one plays into the hands of the other and is connected
with it. To this extent, everything particular [alles Partikulare] takes on a
social character; in the manner of dress and times of meals, there are
certain conventions which one must accept, for in such matters, it is not
worth the trouble to seek to display one's own insight, and it is wisest to
act as others do.

"i

This moment thus becomes a particular end-determinant for the
means themselves and their ownership, and also for the way in which
needs are satisfied. In addition, it immediately involves the require­
ment of equality in this respect with others. On the one hand, the need
for this equality, together with imitatioll as the process whereby people
make themselves like others, and on the other hand the need of
particularity (which is likewise present here) to assert itself through
some distinctive quality, themselves become an actual source of the
multiplication and expansion of needs.

Within social needs, as a combination of immediate or natural needs
and the spiritual needs of represe1ltatiollal thought [Vorstelltmg], the
spiritual needs, as the universal, predominate. This social moment
accordingly contains the aspect of liberation, because the strict natural
necessity of need is concealed and man's relation is to his OWlI opinion,
which is universal, and to a necessity imposed by himself alone,
instead of simply to an external necessity, to inner contingency, and to
arbitrariness.

The notion [Vorstellung] that, in relation to his needs, man
lived in freedom in a so-called state of nature in which he had
only so-called natural needs of a simple kind and in which, to
satisfy these, he employed only those means with which a
contingent nature immediately provided himl this notion,
even if we disregard the moment of liberation which is present
230

L

Ethical Life

§§ 1 92-196

in work (and which will be discussed below), is mistaken. For
a condition in which natural needs as such were immediately
satisfied would merely be one in which spirituality was
immersed in nature, and hence a condition of savagery and
unfreedom; whereas freedom consists solely in the reflection
of the spiritual into itself, its distinction from the natural, and
its reflection upon the latter.

This liberation is fomlal, because the particularity of the ends remains
the basic content. The tendency of the social condition towards an
indeterminate multiplication and specification of needs, means, and
pleasures - i.e. luxury a tendency which, like the distinction between
natural and educateda needs, has no limits [Grenzen], involves an
equally infinite increase in dependence and want. These are confron­
ted with a material which offers infinite resistance, i.e. with external
means whose particular character is that they are the property of the
free will [of others] and are therefore absolutely unyielding.
-

AdditiOll (H). Diogenes, in his whole character as a Cynic,I is in fact
merely a product of the social life of Athens, and what determined him
was the opinion against which his entire way oflife reacted. His way oflife
was therefore not independent, but merely a consequence of these social
conditions, and itself an unprepossessing product of luxury. Where, on
the one hand, luxury is at its height, want and depravity are equally great
on the other, and Cynicism is then evoked by the opposite extreme of
refinement.
aTranslator's note: The first edition, and the Suhrkamp edition, read IIngebiidetem
('uneducated'). I follow Hring's edition (VPR II, 644), whose reading gebildetem ('edu­
cated') makes better sense.

b. The Nature of Work

The mediation whereby appropriate and particularized means are
acquired and prepared for similarly particularized needs is work. By
the most diverse processes, work specifically applies to these
numerous ends the material which is immediately provided by nature.
23 1

Philosophy ofRight
This process of formation gives the means their value and appropri­
ateness, so that man, as a consumer, is chiefly concerned with humall

Additioll (H). There are few immediate materials which do not need to be

processed: even air has to be earned - inasmuch as it has to be heated and perhaps water is unique in that it can be drunk as it is found. It is by
the sweat and labour of human beings that man obtains the means to
satisfY his needs.

The variety of determinations and objects [Gegenstii1zde] which are
worthy of interest is the basis from which theoretical educati01z
develops. This involves not only a variety of representations [Vorstel­
Imzgen] and items of knowledge [Kell1ztllissell], but also an ability to
form such representations [des Vorstellens] and pass from one to the
other in a rapid and versatile manner, to grasp complex and general
relations lBezielumgelz], etc. - it is the education of the understanding
in general, and therefore also includes language. - Practical educati01z
through work consists in the self-perpetuating need and habit oJbeillg
occupied in one way or another, in the limitatioll oJolle's activity to suit
both the nature of the material in question and, in particular, the
arbitrary will of others, and in a habit, acquired through this disci­
pline, of objective activity and ulliversally applicable skills.

Additioll (H). The barbarian is lazy and differs from the educated man in
I'li

his dull and solitary brooding, for practical education consists precisely in
the need and habit of being occupied. The clumsy man always produces
something other than what he intended, because he is not in control ofhis
own actions. But a worker can be described as skilled if he produces the
thing [Sac/ze] as it ought to be, and if, in his subjective actions, he
encounters no resistance to the end he is pursuing.

§ I 98
The universal and objective aspect of work consists, however, in that
[process of] abstractioll which confers a specific character on means
and needs and hence also on production, so giving rise to the divisioll
oJ labour. Through this division, the work of the individual [des
Eillzebwz] becomes simpler, so that his skill at his abstract work

In this dependence and reciprocity of work and the satisfaction of

subjective selfishness turns into a contributiotl towards the satisfoc­
tiOll ofthe needs ofeveryone else. By a dialectical movement, the particu­
needs,

lar is mediated by the universal so that each individual, in earning,
producing, and enjoying on his own account

[fUr sich],

thereby earns

and produces for the enjoyment of others.! This necessity which is
inherent in the interlinked dependence of each on all now appears to
each individual in the form of 111liversal

(see

§ 1 70) in which, through his education and skill, he has an opportun­
ity to share; he is thereby assured of his livelihood, just as the univer­
sal resources are maintained and augmented by the income which he
earns through his work.

§ 200
The possibility, of sharing in the universal resources - i.e. of holding
partiCltlar resources - is, however, conditional upon one's own immedi­

the other; the latter in tum is itself conditioned by the former, but also

inequality of human beings in civil society - an inequality
posited by nature, which is the element of inequality but in
fact produces it out of the spirit itself and raises it to an
inequality of skills, resources, and even of intellectual and
moral education. To oppose this right with a demand for
equality is characteristic of the empty understanding, which
mistakes this abstraction and obligation of its own for the real
and the rational. This sphere of particularity imagines that it is
universal, but in its merely relative identity with the universal,
it retains both natural and arbitrary particularity, and hence
the remnants of the state of nature. In addition, that reason
which is immanent in the system of human needs and their
movement articulates this system into an organic whole com­
posed of different elements (see § 20 1).

The infinitely varied means and their equally infinite and intertwined
movements of reciprocal production and exchange converge, by virtue
of the universality inherent in their content, and become ';f[erentiated
into tmiversal masses. In consequence, the whole complex [Zusammen­
hang] evolves into particular systems of needs, ,vith their corresponding
means, varieties of work, modes of satisfaction, and theoretical and
practical education - into systems to which individuals are separately
assigned, i.e. into different estates.

Additioll (H). The manner in which the universal resources are shared
depends on every particular characteristic of the individuals concerned;
but the universal differences into which civil society is particularized are
necessary in character. While the family is the primary basis of the state,
the estates are the second. The latter are of special importance, because
private persons, despite their selfishness, find it necessary to have
recourse to others. This is accordingly the root which links selfishness
with the universal, i.e. ,vith the state, which must take care to ensure that
this connection is a firm and solid one.

§ 202
The estates are determined, in accordance ,vith the concept, as the
substa11lial or immediate estate, the reflecting or formal estate, and
lastly, the universal estate.

Ethical Lift

§§ 200-203

(a) The substantial estate has its resources in th� natural products of
the soil which it cultivates - soil which is capable of being exclusively
private property, and which requires not just indeterminate exploi­
tation, but fonnation of an objective kind. Given the association of
work and acquisition with fixed individual seasons, and the
dependence of the yield on the varying character of natural processes,
the end to which need is directed in this case becomes that ofprovision
for the future. But because of the conditions to which it is subject, this
provision retains the character of a [mode of] subsistence [Subsistenz]
in which reflection and the will of the individual play a lesser role, and
thus its substantial disposition in general is that of an immediate
ethical life based on the family relationship and on trust.
The proper beginning and original foundation of states has
rightly been equated \vith the introduction of agriculture and of
marriage. For the fonner principle brings with it the cultiva­
tion of the soil, and in consequence exclusively private prop­
erty (cf. Remarks to § 1 7 0), and it reduces the nomadic life of
savages, who seek their livelihood in constant movement, to
the tranquillity of civil law [Privatrecllt] and the secure
satisfaction of needs. This is accompanied by the restriction
[Beschriinklmg] of sexual love to marriage, and the marriage
bond is in tum'eX!ended to become a lasting and inherently [in
sich] universal union, while need becomes care for the family
and possession becomes family property. Security, consolida­
tion, lasting satisfaction of needs, etc. - qualities by which
these institutions primarily recommend themselves - are
nothing but fonns of universality and shapes assumed by
rationality, the absolute and ultimate end, as it asserts itself in
these objects [Gegenstiinden]. - What can be more interesting
in this connection than the ingenious and learned explanations
which my highly esteemed friend, Herr Creuzer, has given of
the agrarian festivals, images, and shrines of the ancients
(especially in the fourth volume of his Mytholog)1 and Symbol­
ism) !? In the consciousness of the ancients, the introduction of
agriculture and of the institutions associated with it were
divine acts, and they were accordingly treated with religious

veneration. A further consequence, which also occurs in the
other estates, is that the substantial character of this estate
entails modifications with regard to civil law - especially to the
administration of justice - and likewise with regard to educa­
tion and instruction and also to religion; these modifications
do not affect the substantial co1ltent, but only its flnn and the
development of reflection.

Additioll (H). In our times, the [agricultural] economy, too, is run in a
reflective manner, like a factory, and it accordingly takes on a character
like that of the second estate and opposed to its own character of natural­
ness. Nevertheless, this first estate will always retain the patriarchal way of
life and the substantial disposition associated with it. The human being
reacts here with immediate feeling [Empfilldtmg] as he accepts what he
receives; he thanks God for it and lives in faith and confidence that this
goodness will continue. What he receives is enough for him; he uses it up,
for it will be replenished. This is a simple disposition which is not
concerned with the acquisition of wealth; it may also be described as that
of the old nobility, which consumed whatever it had. In this estate, the
main part is played by nature, and human industry is sub!' 'dinate to it. In
the second estate, however, it is the understanding itself wHich is essen­
tial, and the prodocts of nature can be regarded only as raw materials.

§ 20 4
(b) The estate oftrade and industry [Stand des Gewerbes] has the task of
giving foml to natural products, and it relies for its livelihood on its
work, on reflection and the understanding, and essentially on its medi­
ation of the needs and work of others. What it produces and enjoys, it
owes chiefly to itself and to its own activity. - Its business is in tum
subdivided into work performed in a relatively concrete manner in re­
sponse to individual [eillzelne] needs and at the request of individurus
[Einzebzer] (the estate of craftsmanship); more abstract work of mass
production which supplies individual needs but is more universally in
demand (the estate of manujacturers); and the business of exchanging
separate commodities [Mittel] for one another, chiefly through the
universal means of exchange, namely money, in which the abstract
value of all goods is actualized (the estate ofcommerce).

Ethical Life
Addition (H). In the estate of trade and industry,
[Individuum] has to rely on himself, and this feeling

§§ 203-206
the individual
of selfhood is

intimately connected with the demand for a condition in which right

is

upheld. The sense of freedom and order has therefore arisen mainly in
towns. The first estate, on the other hand, has little need to think for
itself:a what it gains

is

an alien gift, a gift of nature. This feeling of

dependence is fundamental to it, and may easily be coupled with a will­
ingness to accept whatever may befall it at the hands of other people. The
first estate is therefore more inclined to subservience, the second estate to
freedom.

the equivalent phrase in Hotho's notes (VP R III, 630), hat wenig sidl selbst ;:11 danken
('owes little to its own efforts').

(c) The

universal estate has the universal illferests of society as its busi­

ness. It must therefore be exempted from work for the direct satisfac­
tion of its needs, either by having private resources, or by receiving an
indemnity from the state which calls upon its services, so that the
private interest is satisfied through working for the universal.

On the one hand, the estates, as particularity become objective to itself,
are divided in this way into different general categories in accordance
with the concept. But on the other hand, the question of which
particular estate the

individual

will belong to is influenced by his

natural disposition, birth, and circumstances, although the ultimate

sztbjective opinion and the particular arbi­
trary will, which are accorded their right, their merit, and their honour
in this sphere. Thus, what happens in this sphere through inner
necessity is at the same time mediated by the arbitrary will, and for the
and essential determinant is

subjective consciousness, it has the shape of being the product of its
own

will . 1

In this respect, too, in relation to the principle of particularity
and subjective arbitrariness, a difference emerges between the
political life of east and west, and of the ancient and modem
worlds. In the former, the division of the whole into estates

came about objectively and oj its own accord, because it is
rational in itself, but the principle of subjective particularity
was at the same time denied its rights, as when, for example,
the allocation of individuals to specific estates was left to the
rulers, as in Plato's Republic (Book III, p. 320, Zweibriicken
edition, Vol. VI [41 5 a-d]), or to birth alone, as in the Indian
caste-system.2 Thus subjective particularity, excluded from the
organization of the whole and not reconciled within it, conse­
quently shows itself - since it likewise appears as an essential
moment - as a hostile element, as a corruption of the social
order (see Remarks to § 1 85). It either overthrows the latter,
as in the Greek states and in the Roman Republic; or if the
social order survives as a ruling power - or perhaps as a
religious authority - it appears as inner corruption and com­
plete degeneration, as was to some extent the case in Sparta
and as is now entirely the case in India. - But if it is supported
by the objective order, conforming to the latter and at the
same time retaining its rights, subjective particularity becomes
the sole animating principle of civil society and of the
development of intellectual activity, merit, and honour. The
recognition and right according to which all that is rationally
necessary in civil society and in the state should at the same
time come into effect through the mediation ojthe arbitrary will
is the more precise definition [Bestimmlmg] of what is
primarily meant by the universal idea [Vorstellllng] of freed{}1/l
(see § 1 2 1).

The individual attains actuality only by entering into existetlce [Dasein]
in general, and hence into detemzinate particularity; he must accord­
ingly llinit himself exclusively to one of the particular spheres of need.
The ethical disposition within this system is therefore that of rectitude
and the h01lOur oj one's estate, so that each individual, by a process of
self-determination, makes himself a member of one of the moments
of civil society through his activity, diligence, and skill, and supports
himself in this capacity; and only through this mediation with the
universal does he simultaneously provide for himself and gain recog­
nition in his own eyes [Vorstellll1zg] and in the eyes of others. - Morality

I

Ethical Life

§ § 206-208

has its proper place in this sphere, where reflection on one's own
actions and the ends of welfare and of particular needs are dominant,
and where contingency in the satisfaction of the latter makes even
contingent and individual help into a duty.
Initially - i.e. especially in youth - the individual balks at the
notion

[Vorstel!ung]

of committing himself to a particular

estate, and regards this as a limitation imposed on his univer­
sal detennination and as a purely

external necessity. This is a

consequence of abstract thinking, which stops short at the
universal and so does not reach actuality; it does not recognize
that the concept, in order

to exist, must first of all enter into the

distinction between the concept and its reality, and hence into
detenninacy and particularity (see § 7), and that only thus can
abstract thinking attain actuality and ethical objectivity.

Addition (H). When we say that a human being must be somebody [etwas],
we mean that he must belong to a particular estate; for being somebody
means that he has substantial being.

A human being with no estate

is

merely a private person and does not possess actual universality. On the
other hand, the individual

[der Eillzebze] in his particularity may see him­

self as the universal and believe that he would be lowering himself if he

became a member of an estate. This is the false notion [VoTStelllltzg] that, if
something attains an existence

[Daseill]

which is necessary to it, it is

thereby limiting and surrendering itself.

The principle of this system of needs, as that of the personal

[eigene]

particularity of knowledge and volition, contains within itself that
universality which has being

in and for itself,

i.e. the universality of

The relativity of the reciprocal relation between needs and work to
satisfy these needs includes in the first place its reflection into itselfas
infinite personality in general, i.e. as (abstract) right. But it is this very
sphere of relativity - as that of education - which gives right an existence
[DaseiTl] in which it is universally recognized, known, and willed, and in
which, through the mediation of this quality of being known and
willed, it has validity and objective actuality.

It is part of education, of t!ziT/king as consciousness of the
individual [des Einzelnen] in the form of universality, that I am
apprehended as a universal person, in which [respect] all are
identical. A human being counts as such because he is a human
being, not because he is a Jew, Catholic, Protestant, German,
Italian, etc. This consciousness, which is the aim of thought, is
of infinite importance, and it is inadequate only if it adopts a
fixed position - for example, as cosmopolitanism - in opposition
to the concrete life of the state.

Additi01l (H). On the one hand, it is through the system of particularity
[Partikularitiit] that right becomes externally necessary as a protection for
particular interests [die Beso1lderheit]. Even if its source is the concept,
right comes into existence [Existe1/z] only because it is useful in relation to
:11

"'

needs. In order to conceive of right in terms of thought, one must be
educated in how to think, and not remain confined to the merely sensuous
realm; one must adapt the form of universality to the objects [Gege1/­
stiiTldm], and likewise regulate one's will according to a universal
[principle]. Only after human beings have invented numerous needs for
themselves, and the acquisition of these needs has become entwined with
their satisfaction, is it possible for laws to be made.

§ 210
The objective actuality of right consists partly in its being present to
the consciousness and being in some way known, and partly in its
possessing the power of actuality, in having validity and hence also in
becoming known as universally valid.

a. Right as Law

§ 2II
When what is right in itselJis posited in its objective existence [Dasein]
- i.e. detennined by thought for consciousness and known [bekamlt] as
what is right and valid - it becomes law;a and through this detennina­
tion, right becomes positive right in general.
To posit something as universal - i.e. to bring it to the con­
sciousness as a universal - is, as everyone knows, to think (cf.
Remarks to §§ 1 3 and 2 1 above); when the content is reduced
in this way to its simplest form, it is given its final detenninacy.
Only when it becomes law does what is right take on both the
10nn of its universality and its true detenninacy. Thus, the
process of legislation should not be represented merely by
that one of its moments whereby something is declared to be a
rule of behaviour valid for everyone; more important than this
is the inner and essential moment, namely cognition of the
content in its detenninate universality. Since only animals have
their law as instinct, whereas only human beings have theirs as
custom [Gewohnheit], Cttstomary rights contain the moment of
being thoughts and of being known [gewuflt]. The difference
between these and laws consists [besteht] simply in the fact that
the former are known in a subjective and contingent manner,
so that they are less detenninate for themselves and the
universality of thought is more obscure; and in addition,
cognizance [die Kenntnis] of this or that aspect of right, or of
right in general, is the contingent property of only a few
people. The view that such rights, since they take the form of
customs [Gewohnheiten], are privileged in having become part
of lift is an illusion, for the valid laws of the nation do not
cease to be its customs merely because they have been written
down and collected. (Besides, it is precisely in those areas
which involve the most lifeless material and the most lifeless

and put together - which must happen at an early stage among
a people which has attained even some degree of education this collection is a legal code; and since it is merely a collection,

both in the administration of justice and in the matter [Sache]
itself has, however, been described by those most familiar
with it. I They note in particular the circumstance that, since
this unwritten law is contained in the verdicts of courts of law
and judges, the judges constantly act as legislators;2 they are
""both dependent on the au ority of their preaecessors - since
the latter merely gave expression to the unwritten law - and
independent of it, because they themselves incorporate the
unwritten law and are accordingly entitled to judge whether
earlier decisions were compatible with the unwritten law or
not. - A similar confusion which could have arisen in the
administration of justice during the later Roman Empire
because of the differing authorities of all the famous jurists
was averted when an emperor devised the ingenious
expedient, known as the law of dtations/ which introduced a
kind of college of long-deceased lawyers with a majority vote
and a president (see Hugo's History of Roman Law [1799
edition], § 3 5 4). - To deny a civilized nation, or the legal
profession [dem juristischerl Standel within it, the ability to draw
up a legal code would be among the greatest insults one could

Additioll (H,G). The sun and the planets also have their laws, but they are

posited and known

[gewtlj1t],

all the contingencies of feeling

[ElIlpfilldtl1lg]

and opinion and the forms of revenge, compassion, and selfishness fall
away, so that right only then attains its true determinacy and is duly
honoured. Only through the discipline of being apprehended does it
become capable of universality. Collisions arise in the application of the
law, where the understanding of the judge has its place; this is entirely
necessary, for the implementation of the law would otherwise be a com­
pletely mechanical process. But to go so far as to eliminate such collisions
altogether by relying heavily on the discretion of the judge is a far worse
solution, because collisions are also inherent in thougH, in the thinking
consciousness and its dialectic, whereas the mere decision of a judge
would be arbitrary. It is usually argued in defence of customary right that
it has a living quality, but this living quality, i.e. the identity of the
determination with the subject, is not the whole essence of the matter

precisely to systematize, i.e. to raise to the universal. It has likewise been
held that collections of verdicts such as are found in the

much more valuable than a legal code worked out in the most general

In positive right, what is legal [gesetzmiiflig] is therefore the
source of cognition of what is right [Recht], or more precisely,
of what is lawfit! [Reelztens]; the positive science of right is to
that extent a historical science whose principle is that of auth­
ority. Whatever else may arise is a matter [Sache] for the
understanding and concerns the external classification, com­
pilation, consequences, and further application etc. [of laws].
When the understanding becomes involved with the nature of
the thing [Sache] itself, its theories (e.g. of criminal law) show
what mischief it can do with its deductive reasoning [Riisonne­
ment aus Cribzden]. - On the one hand, positive science has
not only the right, but also the necessary duty to deduce in
every detail from its positive data both the historical develop­
ments and the applications and ramifications of the given
determinations of right, and to follow up their consequences;
but on the other hand, if it is then asked whether, after all
these demonstrations, a determination of right is rational,
those who occupy themselves with this science should at least
not be absolutely astonished, even if they regard the question
as beside the point. - On understanding [the law], cf. Remarks to

While right comes into existence [Dasei1z] primarily in the fonn of
being posited, it also comes into existence in tenns of co1lfent when it
is applied to the material of civil society - to its relationships and
varieties of property and contracts in their endlessly increasing diver­
sity and complexity - and to ethical relationships based on emotion,
love and trust (but only in so far as these contain the aspect of abstract
right - see § 1 59). Since morality and moral precepts concern the will
in its most personal [eigensten] subjectivity and particularity, they can­
not be the object [Cegenstandj of positive legislation. Further material
[for the positive content of right] is furnished by the rights and duties
which emanate from the administration of justice itself, from the
state, etc.

Addition (G). In the higher relationships of marriage, love, religion, and
the state, only those aspects which are by nature capable of having an
external dimension can become the object of legislation. Nevertheless,

the legislation of different peoples varies greatly in this respect. For
example, the Chinese state has a law to the effect that a husband must
love his first wife more than his other wives. If he is convicted of having
done the opposite, he is subjected to corporal punishment. In older
legislations, there are likewise numerous rules concerning loyalty and
honesty which are out of keeping with the nature of law, because they
apply entirely to the realm of inwardness. It is only in the case of oaths,
where things [Dingel are referred to the conscience, that honesty and

to.
It is in this focusing of the universal, not just on the particular

ability - withill the giVetl limits - to stop short and settle the
matter simply in order that a settlement may be reached, or on
such grounds for determination as the choice of a roulld num­
ber, or of the number forty minus one. - It makes no dif­
ference if the law does not specify this ultimate determination
which actuality requires, but leaves it to the judge to decide
and simply limits [besclzribzkt] him to a maximum and
minimum; for the maximum and minimum will themselves be
round numbers of this kind, and they do not remove [hebt es
lIicht azifJ the need for the judge to arrive at a finite and purely
positive determination of the kind referred to, but assign it to
him as a necessary task.

tion of justice which is subject to contingency, and this derives from the
fact that the law is a universal determination which has to be applied to
the individual case. If one were to object to this contingency, the objection
would be merely abstract. For example, the magnitude of a punishment
cannot be made to correspond with any conceptual definition [Begriffi­
bestimmtmg], and whatever is decided will in this respect always be arbi­
trary. But this contingency is itself necessary; and if one uses it as a
general argument against a code oflaws, for example, on the grounds that
the latter is therefore imperfect, this overlooks the very aspect in which
completeness is impossible to attain, and which must therefore be
accepted as it stands.

b. The Existence

[Daseill]

of the Law

§ 215
For the law to have binding force, it is necessary, in view of the right
of self-consciousness (see § 1 3 2 and its appended Remarks) that the
laws should be made universally kllowlI.
To hang the laws at such a height that no citizen could read
them, as Dionysius the Tyrant did,! is an injustice [UlIrecht] of
exactly the same kind as to bury them in an extensive
apparatus of learned books and collections of verdicts based

§§ 2 14-216

Ethical Life
on divergent judgements, opinions, practices, etc., all expres­
sed in a foreign language, so that knowledge

[Kenntnis] of the

laws currently in force is accessible only to those who have
made them an object of scholarly study. - Those rulers who
have given their peoples a collection of laws - if only a form­
less collection like that ofJustinian, or better still, a law ofthe land
embodied in an orderly and specific legal code2 - were not
only the greatest benefactors of their peoples, who duly
praised and thanked them; what they did was at the same time
a great

act ofjustice.

Addition (G). The legal profession [Juristenstandj, which has special
knowledge of the laws, often regards this as its monopoly and no concern
of those who are not among its members. Thus, the physicists took
exception to Goethe's theory of colours1 because he did not belong" to
their profession and was a poet into the bargain. But just as one need not
be a shoemaker to know whether one's shoes fit, so is there no need to
belong to a specific profession in order to know about matters of universal
interest. Right is concerned with freedom, the worthiest and most sacred
possession of man, and man must know about it if it is to have binding
force for him.
aTranslator's note: The past tense is Gans's, for Griesheim's notes read 'does not belong

to their profession and is even a poet' (VPR IV, 543); Goethe, who died in 1832, was still
alive when Griesheirn made his notes from Hegel's lectures.

§ 2I6
On the one hand, simple and universal determinations are required for
the public legal code, but on the other, the nature of thefitlite material
in question leads to endless further determinations. The scope of the

law ought on the one hand to be that of a

complete and self-contained

whole, but on the other hand, there is a constant need for new legal
determinations. But since this antinomy is merely a product of the

specializatiotl

of universal

principles

which

themselves

remain

unchanged, the right to a complete legal code remains intact, as does
the right [which requires] that these simple and universal principles
should be capable of comprehension and formulation without
reference to, and in distinction from, their specialization.
One of the main sources of the complexity oflegislation is that

the rational, i.e. that which is rightful in and for itself, may
gradually infiltrate primitive institutions which contain an
unjust element [ein Unrecht] and are therefore of merely
historical significance. This took place with Roman institu­
tions, as already mentioned (see Remarks to § 1 80), and with
the old feudal law, etc. But it is essential to realize that the
very nature of the finite material entails an infinite progression
when determinations which are universal in themselves and
rational in and for themselves are applied to it. - It is therefore
mistaken to demand that a legal code should be comprehen­
sive in the sense of absolutely complete and incapable of any
further determinations (this demand is a predominantly Ger­
man affliction) and to refuse to accept, i.e. to actualize, some­
thing allegedly imperfect on the grounds that it is incapable of
such completion. Both of these errors are based on a misap­
prehension of the nature of finite matters such as civil law
[Privatrecht], whose so-called perfection is a perennial approx­
imation to perfection, and on a misapprehension of the dif­
ference between the universal of reason and the universal of
the understanding, and of the application of the latter to the
material of finitude and individuality [Einze/heit], whose extent
is infinite. - 'Le plus grand ennemi du bien c'est Ie mieux'· is
an expression of true common sense, as opposed to the com­
mon sense of empty ratiocination and reflection.I

Addition (H,G). Completeness means the comprehensive collection of all
individual items belonging to a given sphere, and no science or area of
knowledge [Kenllt1lis] can be complete in this sense. Now if it is said that
philosophy or any other science is incomplete, it is easy to conclude that
one ought to wait for the remaining part to be added, for it may be that the
best is yet to come. But this is not the way in which progress is made,
whether in geometry, in which new determinations continue to emerge
despite the fact that it appears to be a closed subject, or in philosophy,
which is always capable of further specialization, even if it is concerned
with the universal Idea. The universal law always used to be the Ten
Commandments; and it is manifestly absurd not to promulgate the law
'Thou shalt not kill' on the grounds that a legal code cannot be complete.
"Translator's note: 'The greatest enemy of the good is the better.' I follow the Suhrkamp
edition (Werke VII, 369) and VP R (II, 663) in reading 'mieux', as against the first edition's
'meillt!tll" .

Ethical Life

§§ 2 16-21 7

Even idle reflection may conclude that every legal code is capable of
improvement, for it is possible to imagine what is most glorious, exalted,
and beautiful as being more glorious, exalted, and beautiful still. But a
large and ancient tree puts out more and more branches without thereby
becoming a new tree; yet it would be foolish to refuse to plant a tree just
because it might produce new branches.

Just as right ill itself becomes law in civil society, so too does my
individual [eillzeltze] right, whose existence [Daseill] was previously
immediate and abstract, acquire a new significance when its existence is
recognized as part of the existent [existierenden] universal will and
knowledge. Acquisitions of property and transactions relating to it
must therefore be undertaken and expressed in the fomz which that
existence gives to them. Property is accordingly based on COlltract and
on those fomzalities which make it capable of proof and valid before
the law.
The original, i.e. immediate, modes of acquisition and tides
(see §§ 54ff.) are in fact abandoned in civil society, and occur
only as individual accidents or limited moments. - Both feel­
ing, which remains confined to the subjective, and reflection,
which clings to its abstract essences, reject such formalities,
whereas the dead understanding may for its part hold on to
them in preference to the thing [Sac/ze] itself and multiply
them indefinitely. - Besides, the process of development
[Bildzl1lg] begins with a content whose form is sensuous and
immediate and, by means of long and arduous work, arrives at
the form of thought appropriate to this content and thereby
gives it simple and adequate expression. It is in the nature of
this process that, at the stage when the development of right is
only just beginning, ceremonies and formalities are extremely
elaborate, and count rather as the thing itself than as its
symbol; this is why, even in Roman law, a multitude of
determinations, and especially turns of phrase, was retained
from earlier ceremonies instead of being replaced by
determinations of thought and adequate means of expressing
them.
249

Philosophy ofRight
Additioll

(H,G). When right is posited as what it is in itself, it is law. I
possess something or own a property which I took over as ownerless; this

property must now also be recognized and posited as mine. This is why
there arefonnalities in society with reference to property: boundary stones
are erected as symbols for others to recognize, and mortgage books and
property registers are compiled. Most property in civil society is based on
contract, whose fonnalities are fixed and determinate. One may well view
such fonnalities with antipathy and believe that they exist only in order to
bring in money for the authorities [ObrigkeitJ; they may even be regarded
as offensive and as a sign of mistrust, on the grounds that they invalidate
the saying that a man's word is his bond; but the essential aspect of such
fonns is that what is right in itself should also be posited as right. My will

is a rational will; it has validity, and this validity should be recognized by
others. Here is the point at which my subjectivity and that of others must
be put aside, and the will must attain a security, stability, and objectivity
which fonn alone can give it.

Since property and personality have legal recognition and validity in

crime is no longer an injury [Verletzung] merely to a
subjective infinite, but to the universal cause [Sadie] whose existence
[Existenz] is inherently [in sich] stable and strong. This gives rise to the
viewpoint that an action may be a danger to society. On the one hand,
civil society,

'"11" ;
"

this increases the magnitude of the crime; but on the other, the power
of society has now become sure of itself, and this reduces the external

importance

of the injury and so leads to greater leniency in its

punishment.
The fact that an injury to one member of society is an injury to
all the others does not alter the nature of crime in terms of its
concept, but in terms of its outward existence [Existenz]; for
the injury now affects the attitudes [Vorstellung] and con­
sciousness of civil society, and not just the existence [Dasein]
of the immediately injured party. In heroic ages - see the
tragedies of the ancients - the citizens do not regard the
crimes which members of royal houses commit against each
other as injuries to themselves. - Crime

existence [Dasein],

and since its existence is essentially determined as a

represen-

§§ 2 I 7-2I 9

Ethical Life
tation [ Vorstelltwg] and consciousness ofthe validity ofthe laws, its
danger to civil society is a determination of its magnitude, or
even one of its qualitative determinations. - This quality or
magnitude varies, however, according to the condition of civil
society, and this is the justification both for attaching the
death penalty to a theft of a few pence or of a turnip, and for
imposing a lenient punishment for a theft of a hundred and
more times these amounts. Although the view that they are a
threat to civil society may appear to aggravate crimes, it has in
fact been chiefly responsible for a reduction in punishments.

A penal code is therefore primarily a product of its time and of
the current condition of civil society.

Addition (H). That a crime committed in society should appear greater

and yet be punished more leniendy is an apparent contradiction. But
whereas it would be impossible for society to leave a crime unpunished since the crime would then be posited as right - the fact that society is
sure of itself means that crime, in comparison, is always of a purely
individual character, an unstable and isolated phenomenon. The very
stability of society gives crime the status of something merely subjective,
which seems the product not so much of the deliberate will as of natural
impulse. This view makes crime appear in a milder light, so that its
punishment also becomes milder. If society is still inwardly unstable,
punishments must be made to set an example, for punishment is itself a
counter-example to the example of crime. But in a society which is
internally stable, the positedness of crime is so weak that the cancellation
[Atljlzebtwg] of this positedness must itself assume similar proportions.
Thus, harsh punishments are not unjust in and for themselves, but are
proportionate to the conditions of their time; a criminal code cannot be

valid for every age, and crimes are semblances of existence [Scheill­
exiStetlZetz1 which can meet with greater or lesser degrees of repudiation.

The historical origin of judge and lawcourts may have taken
the form of a patriarchal relationship, of coercion

of free choice; but this is irrelevant as far as the concept of the

is concerned. To regard the introduction of

that thoughtlessness which fails to realize that, since legal and
political institutions in general are rational in character, they
are necessary in and for themselves, and that the form in
which they first arose and were introduced has no bearing on
a discussion of their rational basis. - The opposite extreme to
this view is the crude notion that the administration of justice,
as in the days of the right of private warfare

[Faustrecht], is an

improper use of force, a suppression of freedom, and a rule of
despotism.2 The administration of justice should be regarded
both as a duty and as a right on the part of the public auth­
ority, and as a right, it is not in the least dependent on whether
individuals choose to entrust it to an authority or not.

must also know the laws, otherwise this entitlement would be of no use to
him. But the individual also has the duty to submit to the court's auth­
ority. Under the feudal system, the powerful often refused to do so,
challenging the court and treating it as an injustice [Utlrecht] on the
court's part if they were summoned before it. But conditions such as these
contradict the purpose of a court. In more recent times, sovereign princes
have had to recognize the authority of the courts in private matters, and in
free states, they usually lose their cases.

Addition (H). It may be infuriating to know that one has a right and then

Philosophy ofRight
the parties must be obliged by law to submit themselves to a simple
court (a court of arbitration or court of the first instance) in an attempt
to settle their differences before they proceed any further. This is
necessary in order to protect them - and right itself, as the substantial
matter

[Sache]

at issue - against the process of law and its misuse.

Equity involves

a departure from formal right in the light of

moral or other considerations, and relates primarily to the

co1ltent

of the legal action. The function of a

court of equity,

however, will be to reach a decision on the individual case,
without adhering to the formalities of the legal process and in
particular to the objective evidence as the law may interpret it;
it will also reach its decision in the interests of the individual
case in its

own

right, and not in the interests of making a

universal legal disposition.1

The rights of the subjective consciousness include not only that of
making the laws publicly known (see § 2 1 5), but also the possibility of
knowing [ZU kennen] how the law is actualized in particular cases, i.e. of
.
! .

knowing the course of the external proceedings, legal arguments
[Rechtsgrii1zde], and so forth the publicity ofthe administration ofjustice;
-

for the course of law is in itself an occurrence of universal validity,
and although the particular content of the case may be of interest only
to the parties themselves, its universal content (i.e. the right within it
and the decision on this right) is of interest to everyone.
The deliberations of the members of the court among them­
selves on the judgement they are to deliver are expressions of
opinions and views which are still particular and hence not of a
public nature.

Addition (H).

Straightforward common sense sees it as right and proper
that the administration of justice should be public.1 A major obstacle to
this has always been the high station of those with powers of jurisdiction,
since they are reluctant to appear before the general public, seeing them­
selves as guardians of a right to which the laity should not have access.
But a primary characteristic of a right is that the citizens should have
confidence in it, and it is this aspect which requires that justice should be
dispensed in public. The right of publicity is based on the fact that the
25 4

Ethical Life

§§ 223-226

end of the court is right, which as a universal should also corne before the
universal, and also on the fact that the citizens are thereby convinced that
justice [Recht] is actually being done.

The dispensation of justice, as the application of the law to the
individual case, involves two distinct aspects: first, a knowledge
[Erke7Zntnis] of the nature of the case in its immediate individuality
[Einze/lzeit] - e.g. whether a contract etc. has been made, whether an
offence has been committed and who the culprit is, and in crimi7zal
law, whether the substantial, criminal character of the deed was
determined by premeditation (see Remarks to § I Ig); and secondly,
the subsumption of the case under the law of the restoration of right,
which, in criminal cases, includes the punishment. The decisions on
these two distinct aspects are also distinct functions.
In the judicial system of Rome, the distinction between these
two functions took the form that the praetor gave his decision
on the assumption that the facts of the matter [Sac/ze] were so
and so, and then appointed a special iudex to inquire into these
facts. J - In the English legal system, it is left to the insight or
arbitrary will of the prosecutor to categorize an act in terms of
its specific criminal character (e.g. as murder or
manslaughter), and the court cannot determine otherwise if it
finds his conclusion incorrect.2

In the first place, the supervision of the whole course of the inquiry,
and of the legal actions b etween the parties (which are themselves
rights - see § 222), and in addition the second aspect of legal judge­
ment (see § 225), are the proper task of the professional judge. Since
he is the organ of the law, the case must be prepared for him to enable
it to be subsumed [under the law in question]; that is, it must be
raised out of its apparent empirical character to become a recognized
fact of a universal kind.

255

T

Philosophy ofRight

knowledge [Erkenntnis] of the case in its
immediate individuality [Einzelheit], and its categorization - does not in

The first of these aspects - the

itself involve any legal dispensation. It is a knowledge to which every

educated person

may aspire. The essential factor in categorizing an

action is the subjective moment of the agent's insight and intention
(see Part Two above); besides, proof is concerned not with objects

[Gegenstii11de]

of reason or abstract objects of the understanding, but

only with details, circumstances, and objects of sensuous intuition and
subjective certainty, so that it does not involve any absolutely objective
determination. For these reasons, the ultimate factors in such a deci­
sion are

subjective conviction

and conscience

(animi sententio);1

and in

the case of the proof, which rests on the statements and affirmations
of others, its ultimate (though subjective) guarantee is the

oath.

In dealing with this subject, it is of great importance to bear in
mind the kind of proof here in question, and to distinguish it
from other varieties of cognition and proof. To furnish a proof
of a determination of reason like the concept of right - i.e. to
recognize its necessity - requires a different method from that
required to prove a theorem in geometry. Besides, in the latter
case, the figure is determined by the understanding and
already made abstract in accordance with a law. But with an
empirical content such as a

fact [Tatsache],

the material of

cognition is a given sensuous intuition and the subjective
certainty of the senses, along with depositions and affirma­
tions concerning such material; and from these statements,
testimonies, circumstances, and the like, conclusions and
inferences are subsequently drawn. The objective truth which
emerges from such material and from the method appropriate
to it leads, when the attempt is made to determine it objec­
tively for itself, to

half-prooft

and also, as a perfectly logical

consequence which at the same time contains a formal illogi­
cality, to

extraordinary punishments. This objective truth means

something quite different from the truth of a determination of
reason or of a proposition whose content the understanding
has already determined abstractly for itself. To show that the
recognition of this kind of empirical truth about an event lies

T
Ethical Life

§§ 22 7-228

within the proper legal determination of a court, and that this
determination also gives it a proper qualification, and hence
an exclusive right in itself, to perform this task and makes it
necessary for it to do so - this is an important factor in
considering the extent to which j udgements on facts [das Fak­
tum], as well as on legal questions, should be assigned to
formal courts of law.

Addition (H). There is no reason [Crt/nd] to assume that the professional
judge alone should establish the facts of the case [Tatbestalld], for anyone
with a general (as distinct from purely legal) education is competent in
this matter [Sathe]. An assessment of the facts of the case will be based on
empirical circumstances, on testimonies concerning the deed [Halldltmg]
in question and similar intuitive perceptions [Anschautmgen], but also on
facts [Tatsathen] from which conclusions can be drawn concerning the
deed itself and which make it appear probable or improbable. The aim
here is to attain certainty, not truth in the higher sense, which is invariably
eternal in character. This certainty is subjective conviction or conscience,
and the question here is: what form should this certainty assume in a
court of law? The requirement comlllOnly encountered in German law
rim deutschen Reel/te] that the criminal should confess his guilt has truth on
its side inasmuch as the right of subjective self-consciousness is thereby
satisfied; for what the judges pronounce must not differ from what is in
the consciousness, and only when the criminal confesses does the judge­
ment no longer contain anything alien to him. But the difficulty arises
here that the criminal may deny his guilt, with the result that the interest
of justice is prejudiced. If, on the other hand, the subjective conviction of
the judge is to prevail, an element of harshness is again introduced, for
the person in question is no longer treated as a free individual. The
mediation [between these possibilities] is the requirement that the verdict
of guilt or innocence should emanate from the soul of the criminal - as in

trial by jury.

When judgement is pronounced - in the sense that the case in ques­
tion is thereby subsumed under the law - the right of self-conscious­
ness of the [affected] party is preserved in relation to the law,
inasmuch as the law is known and is consequendy the law of the party
concerned; and it is preserved in relation to the subsumption,
inasmuch as the process of law is public. But as far as the decision on
2 57

J:I

I�

Philosophy ofRight
the partiClllar subjective and external c01llent of the matter [Sadie] is
concerned (knowledge [Erkemltnis] of which belongs to the first of the
two aspects referred to in § 225 above), this right is satisfied by the
cOllfidellce which can be placed in the subjectivity of those who arrive at
the verdict. This confidence is based primarily on their equality with
the party concerned in respect of their particularity - their social
status [Stalld] and the like.
The right of self-consciousness, the moment of subjective
freedom, can be regarded as the substantial viewpoint when we

'"
I"

I!�
."

consider the necessity for publicity in the administration of
justice and for so-called trials by jury.' What may be said in
favour of these institutions on the grounds of their utility is
essentially reducible to this right. Other considerations and
reasons concerning their various advantages and disadvanta­
ges may generate arguments and counter-arguments; but like
all grounds for reasoning [Riis01mement], these are secondary
and inconclusive, or else derived from other and possibly
higher spheres. It is possible that the administration of justice
in itself could be managed well by purely professional courts,
perhaps better than by other institutions. But even if this
possibility could be increased to probability - or indeed to
necessity - it is of no relevance, for on the opposite side there
is always the right ofself-consciousness which retains its claims
and finds that they are not satisfied. - Given the nature of the
entire corpus of laws, knowledge [Ken1llnis] of right and of the
course of court proceedings, as well as the ability to pursue
one's rights, may become the property of a class [Stand] which
makes itself exclusive even by the terminology it uses,
inasmuch as this terminology is a foreign language for those
whose rights are at stake. In this situation, members of civil
society, who depend for their livelihood on their activity, their
OWII knowledge [Wissen] and volitioll, remain alienated not only
from their own most personal interests but also from the
substantial and rational basis of these, namely right, and they
are reduced to a condition of tutelage, or even a kind of serf­
dom, in relation to the class [Stalld] in question. Even if they
have the right to be physically present in court, to have a
flotillg in it (i1l iudicio stare), this counts for little if they are not
258

Ethical Lift

§§ 228-2 3 °

to be present in spirit and with their own knowledge [Wissen],
and the right which they receive will remain an external fote
for them.

In the administration of justice, civil society, in which the Idea has lost
itself in particularity and split up into the division between inward and
outward, returns to its concept, to the unity of the universal which has
being in itself with subjective particularity (although the particularity
in question is that of the individual case, and the universal is that of
abstract right). The actualization of this unity in its extension to the
entire range of particularity, first as a relative union, constitutes the
determination of the police; and secondly, as a limited but concrete
totality, it constitutes the corporati01I.
In civil society, universality is merely necessity. As far as
needs are concerned, right as such is the only fixed point.a But this right,
which is only a limited sphere, relates solely to the protection of what I
possess; welfare is something external to right as such. Nevertheless, this
welfare is an essential determination in the system of needs. Hence the
universal, which in the first instance is merely right, has to be extended
over the entire field of particularity. Justice is a major factor in civil
society: good laws will cause the state to flourish, and free ownership is a
fundamental condition of its success. But since I am completely involved
in particularity, I have a right to demand that, within this context, my
particular welfare should also be promoted. Account should be taken of
my welfare, of my particularity, and this is the task of the police and the
corporation.

Philosophy ofRight
the objective system of needs. Through the administration of justice,
infringements of property or personality are annulled. But the right
which is actually present in particularity means not only that contingencies
which interfere with this or that end should be caT/celled [auJkehoben]
and ' that the undisturbed security of persons and property should be
guaranteed, but also that the livelihood and welfare of individuals
should be secured - i.e. that particular welfore should be treated as a right
and duly actualized.
a. The Police !

In so far as the principle by which this or that end is governed is still
that of the particular will, that authority [Macht] of the universal which
guarantees security remains, on the one hand, primarily limited to the
sphere of contingencies, and on the other, it remains an external order.
:.1

Apart from crimes which the universal authority [Macht] must prevent
or bring to justice - i.e. contingency in the shape of arbitrary evil - the
permissible arbitrariness of inherendy [fUr sich] rightful actions and of
the private use of property also has external relations [Beziehungen]
with other individuals [Eit/zelne], as well as with other public arrange­
ments designed to further a common end. Through this universal
aspect, private actions become a contingent matter which passes out
of my control [Gwalt] and which can wrong or harm other people or
actually does so.

There is admittedly O1Zly a possibility that harm may be done. But the
fact that no harm is done is, as a contingency, likewise no more than
that. This is the aspect of wrong which is inherent in such actions, and
which is consequendy the ultimate reason [Gnmd] for penal justice as
implemented by the police.

260

T

Ethical Life

The relations [Beziehungen] of external existence [Dasein] fall within
the infinite of the understanding; consequently, no boundary is
present in itselfbetween what is harmful and what is harmless (even
with regard to crime), between what is suspicious and what is not
suspicious, or between what should be prohibited or kept under
surveillance and what should be exempted from prohibitions, surveil­
lance and suspicion, inquiry and accountability. The more precise
determinations will depend on custom, the spirit of the rest of the
constitution, prevailing conditions, current emergencies, etc.
Addition (H). No fixed determinations are possible here, and no absolute
boundaries can be drawn. Everything here is personal; subjective opinion
comes into play, and the spirit of the constitution and current dangers will
determine the more precise circumstances. In times of war, for example,
various things which are otherwise harmless must be regarded as harmful.
Because of these aspects of contingency and arbitrary personality, the
police takes on a certain character of maliciollsness. When reflection is
highly developed, the police may tend to draw everything it can into its
sphere of influence, for it is possible to discover some potentially harmful
aspect in everything. On such occasions, the police may proceed very
pedantically and disrupt the ordinary life of individuals. But however
troublesome this may be, no objective boundary line can be drawn here.i

In

the indeterminate multiplication and interdependence of daily
needs, the procurenlent and exchange ofmearls to satisfY these (a process
on whose unimpeded continuance everyone relies) and the need to
make the requisite inquiries and negotiations as short as possible give
rise to aspects of common interest in which the business of one is at
the same time carried out on behalf of all; they also give rise to means
and arrangements which may be of use to the community. These
universal fimcti01ls and arrangements ofpublic utility require oversight
and advance provision on the part of the public authority [Macht].

The differing interests of producers and consumers may come into
collision with each other, and even if, 011 the whole, their correct

Philosophy ojRight
relationship re-establishes itself automatically, its adjustment also
needs to be consciously regulated by an agency which stands above
both sides. The right to regulate individual matters in this way (e.g. by
deciding the value of the commonest necessities of life) is based on
the fact that, when commodities in completely universal everyday use
are publicly marketed, they are offered not so much to a particular
individual [Individuum] as such, as to the individual in a universal
sense, i.e. to the public; and the task of upholding the public's right
not to be cheated and of inspecting market commodities may, as a
common concern, be entrusted to a public authority [Macht]. But
the main reason why some universal provision and direction are
necessary is that large branches of industry are dependent on external
circumstances and remote combinations whose full implications can­
not be grasped by the individuals [Individuen] who are tied to these
spheres by their occupation.
-

At the opposite extreme to freedom of trade and commerce in
civil society are public arrangements to provide for and
determine the work of everyone. These included, for exam­
ple, the building of the pyramids in ancient times, and other
enonnous works in Egypt and Asia which were undertaken for
public ends, and in which the work of the individual [des
Einzelnen] was not mediated by his particular arbitrary will and
particular interest. This interest invokes the freedom of trade
and commerce against regulation from above; but the more
blindly it immerses itself in its selfish ends, the more it
requires such regulation to bring it back to the universal, and
to moderate and shorten the duration of those dangerous
convulsions to which its collisions give rise, and which should
return to equilibrium by a process of unconscious necessity.
Addition (H). The aim of oversight and provisions on the part of the police
is to mediate between the individual [Individuum] and the universal possi­

bility which is available for the attainment of individual ends. The police
should provide for street-lighting, bridge-building, the pricing of daily
necessities, and public health. Two main views are prevalent on this
subject. One maintains that the police should have oversight over every­
thing/ and the other maintains that the police should have no say in such
matters, since everyone ,viII be guided in his actions by the needs of
others. The individual [der Einzeble] must certainly have a right to earn his
living in this way or that; but on the other hand, the public also has a right
262

Ethical Life
to

expect that necessary tasks will be performed in the proper manner.
Both viewpoints must be satisfied, and the freedom of trade should not be
such as to prejudice the general good.

Now even if the possibility exists for individuals to share in the
universal resources, and even if this possibility is guaranteed by the
public authority [Macht], it remains - apart from the fact that such a
guarantee must always be incomplete - open to contingencies of a
subjective kind. This is increasingly the case the more it takes such
conditions as skill, health, capital, etc. for granted.

Initially, the family is the substantial whole whose task it is to provide
for this particular aspect of the individual, both by giving him the
means and skills he requires in order to earn his living from the
universal resources, and by supplying his livelihood and maintenance
in the event of his incapacity to look after himself. But civil society
tears the individual [IlIdividuum] away from family ties, alienates the
members of the family from one another, and recognizes them as self­
suffiCient persons. Furthermore, it substitutes its own soil for the
external inorganic nature and paternal soil from which the individual
[der Eillzehze] gained his livelihood, and subjects the existence [Beste­
hm] of the whole family itself to dependence on civil society and to
contingency. Thus, the individual [ltzdividzlUm] becomes a SOll ofcivil
society, which has as many claims upon him as he has rights in relation
to it.
(H). Admittedly, the family must provide food for its individual
members [Ei1lzellle1l], but in civil society, the family is subordinate and
merely lays the foundations; its effectiveness is no longer so comprehen­
sive. Civil society, on the other hand, is the immense power which draws
people to itself and requires them to work for it, to owe everything to it,
and to do everything by its means. Thus, if a human being is to be a
member ofcivil society, he has rights and claims in relation to it, just as he
had in relation to his family. Civil society must protect its members and
defend their rights, just as the individual [der Ei1lzel1le] owes a duty to the
rights of civil society.

In this character as a

to supervise and influence the

education [ErziehU1zg]

of chil­

communal arrangements can be made for this purpose, it is likewise
incumbent upon civil society to make them.

Addition (H,G). It is difficult to draw a boundary here between the rights
of parents and those of civil society. As far as education is concerned,

.,

parents usually consider that they have complete freedom and can do
whatever they please. With all public education, the main opposition
usually comes from the parents, and it is they who protest and speak out
about teachers and institutions because their own preference goes against
them. Nevertheless, society has a right to follow its own tested views on
such matters, and to compel parents to send their children to school, to
have them vaccinated, etc. The controversies which have arisen in France
between the demands for freedom of instruction (i.e. for parental choice)
and for state supervision are relevant in this context.a
aTranslator's ,zote: This final sentence has no counterpart in the sections of Hotho's and
Griesheim's notes on which this Addition is based (cf. VPR Ill, 70I f. and IV, 602ff.).

In the same way, society has the duty and right to act as guardian on
behalf of those who destroy the security of their own and their family's
livelihood by their extravagance, and to implement their end and that
of society in their place.

Addition (G). In Athens, the law obliged every citizen to give an account of
his means of support; the view nowadays is that this is a purely private
matter. J On the one hand, it is true that every individual has an
independent existence [ist jedes bzdividtwm fiir sich]; but on the other, the
individual is also a member of the system of civil society, and just as every
human being has a right to demand a livelihood from society, so also must
society protect him against himself. It is not just starvation which is at
stake here; the wider viewpoint is the need to prevent a rabble from
emerging. Since civil society is obliged to feed its members, it also has the
right to urge them to provide for their own livelihood.

Ethical Life

Not only arbitrariness, however, but also contingent physical factors
and circumstances based on external conditions (see § 200) may
reduce individuals to poverty. In this condition, they are left with the
needs of civil society and yet - since society has at the same time taken
from them the natural means of acquisition (see § 2 1 7), and also
dissolves [azifhebt] the bond of the family in its wider sense as a
kinship group (see § 1 8 1) - they are more or less deprived of all the
advantages of society, such as the ability to acquire skills and educa­
tion in general, as well as of the administration of justice, health care,
and often even of the consolation of religion. For the poor, the univer­
sal authority [Macht] takes over the role of the family with regard not
only to their immediate deficiencies, but also to the disposition of
laziness, viciousness, and the other vices to which their predicament
and sense of wrong give rise.

The subjective aspect of poverty, and in general of every kind of want
to which all individuals are exposed, even in their natural environ­
ment, also requires subjective help, both with regard to the particular
circumstances and with regard to emotion and love. This is a situation
in which, notwithstanding all universal arrangements, morality finds
plenty to do. But since this help, both in itself [ftir sich] and in its
effects, is dependent on contingency, society endeavours to make it
less necessary by identifYing the universal aspects of want and taking
steps to remedy them.
The contingent character of almsgiving and charitable dona­
tions (e.g. for burning lamps before the images of saints, etc.)
is supplemented by public poorhouses, hospitals, streetlight­
ing, etc. Charity still retains enough scope for action, and it is
mistaken if it seeks to restrict the alleviation of want to the
partiCIIlarity of emotion and the colltingency of its own disposi­
tion and knowledge [Ke1l1Itnis], and if it feels injured and
offended by universal rulings and precepts of an obligatory
kind. On the contrary, public conditions should be regarded
as all the more perfect the less there is left for the individual to
265

Philosophy ojRight
do by himself [/iir sich] in the light of his own particular
opinion (as compared with what is arranged in a universal
manner).1

When the activity of civil society is unrestricted, it is occupied inter­
nally with expalldillg its population and industry. - On the one hand, as
the association [Zusammt'1lhang] of human beings through their needs
is universalized, and \vith it the ways in which means of satisfYing these
needs are devised and made available, the accumulation of wealth
increases; for the greatest profit is derived from this twofold univer­
sality. But on the other hand, the specialization [Vereinzeizmg] and
limitation of particular work also increase, as do likewise the
dept'1ldt'1lce and watlt of the class I which is tied to such work; this in
tum leads to an inability to feel and enjoy the wider freedoms, and
particularly the spiritual advantages, of civil society.

When a large mass of people sinks below the level of a certain
standard of living - which automatically regulates itself at the level
necessary for a member of the society in question - that feeling of
right, integrity [Reclltlichkeit], and honour which comes from support­
ing oneself by one's own activity and work is lost. This leads to the
creation of a rabble, which in tum makes it much easier for dispropor­
tionate wealth to be concentrated in a few hands.
Addition (G). The lowest level of subsistence [Subsiste1lz], that of the
rabble, defines itself automatically, but this minimum varies greatly
between different peoples. In England, even the poorest man believes he
has his rights; this differs from what the poor are content with in other
countries. Poverty in itself does not reduce people to a rabble; a rabble is
created only by the disposition associated with poverty, by inward rebel­
lion against the rich, against society, the government, etc. It also follows
that those who are dependent on contingency become frivolous and lazy,
like the lazzaro1/i of Naples, for example. This in tum gives rise to the evil
that the rabble do not have sufficient honour to gain their livelihood
through their own work, yet claim that they have a right to receive their
livelihood. No one can assert a right against nature, but within the condi266

Ethical Life
tions of society hardship at once assumes the form of a wrong inflicted on
this or that class. The important question ofhow poverty can be remedied
is one which agitates and torments modern societies especially/

If the direct burden [of support] were to fall on the wealthier class, or
if direct means were available in other public institutions (such as
wealthy hospitals, foundations, or monasteries) to maintain the
increasingly impoverished mass at its normal standard of living, the
livelihood of the needy would be ensured without the mediation of
work; this would be contrary to the principle of civil society and the
feeling of self-sufficiency and honour among its individual members.
Alternatively, their livelihood might be mediated by work (i.e. by the
opportunity to work) which would increase the volume of production;
but it is precisely in overproduction and the lack of a proportionate
number of consumers who are themselves productive that the evil
[ Ubel] consists [besteht], and this is merely exacerbated by the two
expedients in question. This shows that, despite an excess of wealth,
civil society is 110t wealthy enough i.e. its own distinct resources are
not sufficient - to prevent an excess of poverty and the formation of a
rabble.
-

The example of El1glal1d permits us to study these phenomena
[Erscheilllmgen] on a large scale, especially the results achieved
by poor-rates, boundless donations, and equally limitless
private charity, and above all by the abolition [Aujheben] of the
corporations. There (especially in Scotland), it has emerged
that the most direct means of dealing with poverty, and par­
ticularly ,vith the renunciation of shame and honour as the
subjective bases of society and with the laziness and extrava­
gance which give rise to a rabble, is to leave the poor to their
fate and direct them to beg from the public.

This inner dialectic of society drives it - or in the first instance this
specific society to go beyond its own confines and look for consumers,
and hence the means it requires for subsistence [Subsistetlz], in other
-

Philosophy ojRight
nations [Viilkem] which lack those means of which it has a surplus or
which generally lag behind it in creativity, etc.

Just as the earth, the firm and solid grou7ld, is a precondition of the
principle of family life, so is the sea the natural element for industry,
whose relations ,vith the external world it enlivens. By exposing the
pursuit of gain to danger, industry simultaneQusly rises above it; and
for the ties of the soil and the limited circles of civil life with its
pleasures and desires, it substitutes the element of fluidity, danger,
and destruction. Through this supreme medium of communication, it
also creates trading links between distant countries, a legal [recht­
lichro] relationship which gives rise to contracts; and at the same time,
such trade [Verkehr] is the greatest educational asset [Bildu7lgsmittelJ
and the source from which commerce derives its world-historical
significance.
Rivers are 7lot 7latural bou7ldaries, which they have been taken
to represent in modem times. On the contrary, both they and
the oceans link human beings together. It is also inaccurate on
Horace's part to say:
deus abscidit
Prudens Oceano dissociabili
Terras·
This can be seen not only from the fact that river basins are
inhabited by a single tribe or people, but also, for example,
from the relations which existed in former times between
Greece, Ionia, and Magna Graecia, between Brittany and
Britain, between Denmark and Norway, Sweden, Finland,
Livonia, etc.; it is also particularly clear when we contrast this
with the lesser degree of contact between the inhabitants of
coastal territories and those of the interior. - But in order to
appreciate what an educational asset is present in the link with
the sea, one should compare the relationship to the sea of
those nations in which creativity has flourished with those
which have shunned navigation and which, like the Egyptians
"Translator's note: 'A prudent god separated the lands by the dividing ocean'. !

and Indians, have stagnated internally and sunk into the most
appalling and miserable superstition; one should likewise note
how all great and enterprising nations push their way to the
sea.

This extended link also supplies the means necessary for

colonization

- whether sporadic or systematic - to which the fully developed civil
society is driven, and by which it provides part of its population with a
return to the family principle in a new country, and itself with a new
market and sphere of industrial activity.

Addition (G). Civil society is driven to establish colonies. The increase of
population alone has this effect; but a particular factor is the emergence
of a mass of people who cannot gain satisfaction for their needs by their
work when production exceeds the needs of consumers. Sporadic col­
onization is found particularly in Germany. The colonists move to
America or Russia and retain no links with their home country, to which
they are consequently of no service. The second variety of colonization,
quite different from the first, is systematic. It is initiated by the state,
which is aware of the proper way of carrying it out and regulates it
accordingly. This mode of colonization was frequently employed by the
ancients, especially the Greeks. Hard work was not the concern [Sadze] of
the Greek citizen, whose activity was directed rather towards public
affairs [Ojfentlichetz Dingen] . Accordingly, whenever the population grew to
a point at which it could become difficult to provide for it, the young
people were sent off to a new region, which was either specifically chosen
or left to be discovered by chance. In more recent times, colonies have not
been granted the same rights as the inhabitants of the mother country,
and this situation has resulted in wars and eventual independence, as the
history of the English and Spanish colonies shows. The liberation of
colonies itself proves to be of the greatest advantage to the mother state,
just as the emancipation of slaves is of the greatest advantage to the
master. }

What the police provides for in the first instance is the actualization
and preservation of the universal which is contained within the par­
ticularity of civil society, [and it does so] as

269

an extemal order and

Philosophy ofRight
arrangement for the protection and security of the masses of particular
ends and interests which have their subsistence [Bestehen] in this
universal; as the higher guiding authority, it also provides for those
interests which extend beyond the society in question (see § 246). In
accordance with the Idea, particularity itself makes this universal,
which is present in its immanent interests, the end and object [Gegen­
stand] of its will and activity, with the result that the ethical returns to
civil society as an immanent principle; this constitutes the determina­
tion of the corporation.
b. The Corporation

§ 250
The agricultural estate, in view of the substantiality of its natural and
family life, has within itself, in immediate form, the concrete universal
in which it lives. The U1liversal estate, by definition [in seiner Bestim­
mung], has the universal for itself as its basis and as the end of its
activity. The intermediate estate, i.e. the estate of trade and industry,
is essentially concerned with the particular, and the corporation is
therefore specially characteristic of it. J

The work performed by civil society is divided into different branches
according to its particular nature. Since the inherent likeness of such
particulars, as the quality common to them all, comes into existence
[Existenz] in the association, the selfish end which pursues its own
particular interest comprehends [foftt] and expresses itself at the same
time as a universal end; and the member of civil society, in accordance
with his particular skill, is a member of a corporation whose universal
end is therefore wholly concrete, and no wider in scope than the end
inherent in the trade which is the corporation's proper business and
interest.

§ 25 2
By this definition [Bestimmtl1lg], the corporation has the right, under
the supervision of the public authority [Macht], to look after its own

Ethical Lift

§ § 249-2 5 3

interests within its enclosed sphere, to admit members in accordance
with their objective qualification of skill and rectitude and in numbers
determined by the universal context, to protect its members against
particular contingencies, and to educate others so as to make them
eligible for membership. In short, it has the right to assume the role of
a second family for its members, a role which must remain more
indeterminate in the case of civil society in general, which is more
remote from individuals and their particular requirements.
The tradesman [Gewerbsmann] is distinct from the day
labourer, as he is from someone who is prepared to perform
an occasional [einzelnen] contingent service. The former, who
is - or wishes to become - a master, is a member of an
association not for occasional contingent gain, but for the
whole range and universality of his particular livelihood. Privileges, in the sense of rights of a branch of civil society
which constitutes a corporation, are distinct from privileges
proper in the etymological sense, I in that the latter are con­
tingent exceptions to the universal law, whereas the former
are no more than legally fixed determinations which lie in the
particular nature of an essential branch of society itself.

the corporation, the family not only has its firm basis in that its
livelihood is guaranteed - i.e. it has secure resources (see § 1 70) - on
condition of its [possessing a certain] capability, but the two [i.e.
livelihood and capability] are also recognized, so that the member of a
corporation has no need to demonstrate his competence and his
regular income and means of support - i.e. the fact that he is somebody
- by any further external evidence. In this way, it is also recognized that
he belongs to a whole which is itself a member of society in general,
and that he has an interest in, and endeavours to promote, the less
selfish end of this whole. Thus, he has his honour in his estate.
In

As a guarantor of resources, the institution of the corporation

corresponds to the introduction of agriculture and private
property in another sphere (see Remarks to § 203). - When
complaints are made about that luxury and love of extrava­
gance of the professional fgewerbetreibenden] classes which is
271

associated with the creation of a rabble (see § 244), we must
not overlook, in addition to the other causes

[of this

phenomenon] (e.g. the increasingly mechanical nature of

etlzical basis as implied in what has been said above.

estate can be devised. - Within the corporation, the help

[mit

humiliating character, and wealth, in fulfilling the

duty it owes to its association, loses the ability to provoke
arrogance in its possessor and envy in others; rectitude also
receives the true recognition and honour which are due to it.

In the corporation, the so-called

natural right to

practise one's skill

and thereby earn what there is to earn is limited only to the extent
that, in this context, the skill is rationally determined. That is, it is
freed from personal opinion and contingency, from its danger to
oneself and others, and is recognized, guaranteed, and at the same
time raised to a conscious activity for a common end.

§ 2 55
The fomily is the first

second, and it is based in civil society. The former contains the
moments of subjective particularity and objective universality in sub­
stantial unity; but in the latter, these moments, which in civil society
are at first divided into the i1lternally reflected particularity of need and

Ethical Life
satisfaction and abstract legal [rechtlichC1l] universality, are inwardly
united in such a way that particular welfare is present as a right and is
actualized within this union.
The sanctity of marriage and the honour attaching to the
corporation are the two moments round which the dis­
organization of civil society revolves.

Addition (H). When the corporations were abolished [aufkehobC1l] in recent
times, it was with the intention that the individual [tier Einze/ne] should
look after himself. But even if we accept this, the corporation does not
affect the individual's obliga!ion to earn his living. In our modem states,
the citizens have only a limited share in the universal business of the state;
but it is necessary to provide ethical man with a universal activity in
addition to his. private end. This universal [activity], which the modern
state does not always offer him, can be found in the corporation. We saw
earlierI that, in providing for himself, the individual [das Individuum] in
civil society is also acting for others. But this unconscious necessity is not
enough; only in the corporation does it become a knowing and thinking
[part ofl' ethical life. The corporation, of course, must come under the
higher supervision of the state, for it would otherwise become ossified and
set in its ways, and decline into a miserable guild system.2 But the
corporation in and for itself is not an enclosed guild; it is rather a means
of giving the isolated trade an ethical status, and of admitting it to a circle
in which it gains strength and honour.

The end of the corporation, which is limited and finite, has its truth in
the C1ld which is universal in and for itself and in the absolute actuality
of this end. So likewise do the separation and relative identity which
were present in the external organization of the police. The sphere of
civil society thus passes over into the state.
The town is the seat of civil trade and industry, of self­
absorbed and divisive [vereinzelnden] reflection, of individuals
who mediate their own self-preservation in relation to other
legal [rechtlichC1l] persons. The country is the seat of an ethical
life based on nature and the family. Town and country - these
constitute in general the two ideal moments from which the
state emerges as their true ground. - This development of
immediate ethical life through the division of civil society and
273

Philosophy ofRight
on to the state, which is shown to be their true ground, is the
scientific proofof the concept of the state, a proof which only a
development of this kind can furnish. - Since the state
appears as the result of the development of the scientific con­
cept in that it turns out to be the true ground [of this develop­
ment], the mediation and semblance already referred to are
likewise superseded by immediacy. In actuality, therefore, the
state in general is in fact the primary factor; only within the
state does the family first develop into civil society, and it is
the idea of the state itself which divides into these two
moments. In the development of civil society, the ethical sub­
stance takes on its infinite form, which contains within itself
the following two moments: (I) infinite differentiation to the
point at which the inward being [Insichsein] of self-conscious­
ness attains being-for-itself and (2) the form of universality
which is present in education, the form of thought whereby the
spirit is objective and actual to itself as an organic totality in
laws and institutions, i.e. in its own will as thought.

274

S ECTION

The State

The state is the actuality of the ethical Idea - the ethical spirit as
substantial will, manifest and clear to itself, which thinks and knows
itself and implements what it knows in so far as it knows it. It has its
immediate existence [Existenz] in custom and its mediate existence in
the self-consciousness of the individual [des Einzelnen], in the individu­
al's knowledge and activity, just as self-consciousness, by virtue of its
disposition, has its substa1ltial freedom in the state as its essence, its
end, and the product of its activity.
The Penates are the inner and lower gods, and the spirit of the
nati011 (Athene) is the divine which knows and wills itself. Piety
is feeling [Empfindung] and ethical life governed by feeling,
and political virtue is the willing of that thought end which has
being in and for itself.

The state is the actuality of the substantial will, an actuality which it
possesses in the particular self-cOllSciOllsness when this has been raised
to its universality; as such, it is the rational in and for itself. This
substantial unity is an absolute and unmoved end in itself, and in it,
freedom enters into its highest right, just as this ultimate end poss­
esses the highest right in relation to individuals [die Einzelnen], whose
highest duty is to be members of the state.

is equated with the security and protection of property and
personal freedom, the interest of individuals [der Einzehzen] as
such becomes the ultimate end for which they are united; it
also follows from this that membership of the state is an
optional matter. - But the relationship of the state to the
individual [bzdividuum] is of quite a different kind. Since the
state is objective spirit, it is only through being a member of
the state that the individual [Individuum] himself has objec­
tivity, truth, and ethical life. Union as such is itself the true
content and end, and the destiny [Bestimmung] of individuals
[Individuen] is to lead a universal life; their further particular
satisfaction, activity, and mode of conduct have this substan­
tial and universally valid basis as their point of departure and
result. - Considered in the abstract, rationality consists in
general in the unity and interpenetration of universality and
individuality [Einzellzeit]. Here, in a concrete sense and in
tenus of its content, it consists in the unity of objective
freedom (Le. of the universal substantial will) and subjective
freedom (as the freedom of individual [i1zdividuellen] know­
ledge and of the will in its pursuit of particular ends). And in
terms of its form, it therefore consists in self-determining
action in accordance with laws and principles based on thought
and hence universal. - This Idea is the being of spirit as
necessary and eternal in and for itself. - As far as the Idea of
the state itself is concerned, it makes no difference what is or
was the historical origin of the state in general (or rather of any
particular state with its rights and determinations) - whether it
first arose out of patriarchal conditions, out of fear or trust,
out of corporations etc., or how the basis of its rights has been
understood and fixed in the consciousness as divine and posi­
tive right or contract, habit, etc. In relation to scientific cogni­
tion, which is our sole concern here, these are questions of
appearance, and consequently a matter [Sache] for history. In
so far as the authority of any actual state concerns itself with
the question of reasons, these will be derived from the forms
of right which are valid within that state. - The philosophical
approach deals only with the internal aspect of all this, with
the concept as thought [mit dem gedaclzten Begriffi]. As far as the

Ethical Lift

§ 25 8

search for this concept is concerned, it was the achievement of
Rousseau to put forward the will as the principle of the state, a
principle which has

thought not only as its

form (as with the

social instinct, for example, or divine authority) but also as its
content, and which is in fact

thinking itself.

But Rousseau

considered the will only in the determinate form of the

individual [einzelnen] will (as Fichte subsequendy also did) and
regarded the universal will not as the will's rationality in and

common element arising out of this

individuals [tier Einzebzen] within the state thus becomes a
contraa, which is accordingly based on their arbitrary will and

opinions, and on their express consent given at their own
discretion; and the further consequences which follow from
this, and which relate merely to the understanding, destroy
the divine [element] which has being in and for itself and its
absolute authority and majesty. Consequendy, when these
abstractions were invested with power, they afforded the
tremendous spectacle, for the first time we know of in human
history, of the overthrow of all existing and given conditions
within an actual major state and the revision of its constitution
from first principles and purely in terms of thought; the

i,zten­
tion behind this was to give it what was supposed to be a purely
rational basis. On the other hand, since these were only
abstractions divorced from the Idea, they turned the attempt

into the most terrible and drastic event.2 - In opposition to the
principle of the individual will, we should remember the
fundamental concept according to which the objective will is

and willed by them at

the principle of the individual will) embodies only one (conse­
quendy one-sided) moment of the

Idea of the rational will,

be apprehended by cognition as something rational for itself is
[the practice of] taking the externality of appearance and the
contingencies of want, need of protection, strength, wealth,
etc. not as moments of historical development, but as the
substance of the state. Here, the principle of cognition is once
again that of separate individuality [die Einzelheit der
Individuen], but not so much the thought of this individuality as
the converse of this, namely empirical individuality with all its
contingent qualities of strength and weakness, wealth and
poverty, etc. This notion [Einfam of ignoring the state's
infinity and rati07/ality in and for itself and of banishing thought
from the apprehension of its inner nature has probably never
appeared in so unadulterated a form as in Herr von Haller's
Restoration ofPolitical Science.3 It is unadulterated, because in all
other attempts to grasp the essence of the state, however one­
sided or superficial their principles may be, this very intention
of comprehending the state brings with it thoughts or universal
determinations. Here, however, Herr von Haller not only
consciously dispenses with the rational content of the state
and with the form of thought, but fulminates with passionate
zeal against them both. This Restoration doubtless owes part of
what Herr von Haller assures us is the widespread influence
of its principles to the fact that it has managed, in its presen­
tation, to dispense with all thoughts, and has thereby managed
to make the whole work as of one piece in its thoughtlessness.
For in this way, it avoids the confusion and discontinuity
which diminish the impact of a presentation in which
references to the substantial are mixed in with the contingent,
and reminders of the universal and rational are intermingled
with the merely empirical and external, with the result that, in
the sphere of the empty and insignificant, we are reminded of
the higher realm of the infinite. - This presentation is equally
consistent in one further respect. For since the sphere of con­
tingency, rather than the substantial, is taken to be the essence
of the state, the content of such a work is consistent precisely
in the utter inconsistency of its thoughtlessness, in that it
heedlessly goes its way and is soon just as much at home with
the opposite of what it had approved a moment earlier.t

tHegel's nOle: In view of the characteristics specified above, the book in question is of an

Addition (G). The state in and for itselfis the ethical whole, the actualiza­
tion of freedom, and it is the absolute end of reason that freedom should
be actual. The state is the spirit which is present in the world and which
consciously realizes itself therein, whereas in nature, it actualizes itself only
as the other of itself, as dormant spirit. Only when it is present in
consciousness, knowing itself as an existent object [Gegenstandj, is it the
state. Any discussion of freedom must begin not with individuality
[Einzelheit] or the individual self-consciousness, but only with the essence
of self-consciousness; for whether human beings know it or not, this
essence realizes itself as a self-sufficient power of which single individuals
[die einzelnetl ltldividuen] are only moments. The state consists in the
march of God in the world, and its basis is the power of reason actua1izing
itself as will . In considering the Idea of the state, we must not have any
particular states or particular institutions in mind; instead, we should
consider the Idea, this actual God, in its own right [liir sich]. Any state,
even if we pronounce it bad in the light of our own principles, and even if
we discover this or that defect in it, invariably has the essential moments
of its existence [Existenz] within itself (provided it is one of the more
advanced states of our time). But since it is easier to discover deficiencies
than to comprehend the affirmative, one may easily fall into the mistake of
overlooking the inner organism of the state in favour of individual
[einzelne] aspects. The state is not a work of art; it exists in the world, and
hence in the sphere of arbitrariness, contingency, and error, and bad
behaviour may disfigure it in many respects. But the ugliest man, the
criminal, the invalid, or the cripple is still a living human being; the
affirmative aspect - life - survives [besteht] in spite of such deficiencies,
and it is with this affirmative aspect that we are here concerned.
original kind. In itself [jiir sich], the author's indignation couId well have something noble
about it, for it was sparked off by the false theories referred to above (which originated
largely with Rousseau), and above all by attempts to put these theories into practice. But
in order to escape from these, Herr von Haller has withdrawn to the opposite extreme,
which is totally devoid of thought and therefore cannot claim tEl have any substance
[Gehalt] - that is, the most viruIent hatred of all /alPs and legislation, and of allfonnally and
legally detennilled right. Hatred of lalP, of legally determined right, is the shibboleth
whereby fanaticism, imbecility, and hypocritical good intentions manifesdy and infallibly
reveal themselves for what they are, no matter what disguise they may adopt. - Orig­
inality like that of Herr von Haller is always a remarkable phenomenon [Et:rcheinzmg],
and I will cite some examples of it for those of my readers who are as yet unfamiliar with
his book. Herr von Haller first puts forward his basic principle (Vol. I, pp. 342ff.),
namely 'that just as, in the inanimate world, the larger displaces the smaller, the powerful
the weak, etc., so also among the animals, and likewise among human beings, does the
same law reappear in nobler (often surely also in ignoble?)" forms [Gestalten)" and 'that
this is accordingly the eternal and unalterable ordinallce of God, that the more pOlPerjil1 rules,
must rule, and always shall rule'. It is evident even from this, as well as from what

"Translator's 1I0te: The words in parentheses are Hegel's own interjection.

2 79

Philosophy ofRight
follows, what is meant by power in this context: it is not the power of justice and ethics,
but the contingent power of nature. In support of this, Herr von Haller further cites,
among other reasons (pp. 365f.), the fact that nature, with admirable wisdom, has
ordained that the very sense of one's own superiority irresistibly ennobles the character
and favours the development of precisely those virtues which are most necessary to one's
subordinates. He asks, with elaborate formal rhetoric, 'whether it is the strong or the
weak in the realm of the sciences who more often abuse their authority and trust for base
and selfish ends and to the detriment of credulous people, whether among jurists the
masters of their science are the pettifoggers and cavilling lawyers who deceive the hopcs
of credulous clients, who call white black and black white, who misuse the laws as a
vehicle of wrongdoing, who make beggars out of those who need their protection and
who, like hungry vultures, tear the innocent lamb to pieces, etc.' Herr von Haller forgets
at this point that he is employing such rhetoric precisely in order to defend the proposi­
tion that the rule oJthe morepowerjill is an eternal ordinance of God, the very ordinance
whereby the vulture tears the innocent lamb to pieces, and that those whose knowledge
[Kenntnis] of the law gives them greater power are therefore quite right to plunder the
credulous people who need their protection, since they are the weak. But it would be
expecting too much for two thoughts to be brought together where not a single thought is
present. - It goes \vithout saying that Herr von Haller is an enemy of legal codes. Civil
laws, in his opinion; are on the one hand completely 'unnecessary, in that they follow

self-evidentlyJrom the law oJnature'. It would have saved much of the effort that has been
expended on legislation and legal codes since states first began, and that is still expended

on such matters and on the study of jurisprudence [des gesetzlichen Reclus], if people had
always been content with the sound principle that all this is self-evident. 'On the other
hand, laws are not in fact made for private persons, but as instructions for lesser
magistrates to acquaint them \vith the will of the chief justice. Jurisdiction is not in any
case a duty on the part of the state (Vol. I, pp. 297f. and

passim), but a charitable act, a

service provided by those \vith greater power and purely as an accessory. It is not the
most perfect means of guaranteeing right, but is in fact insecure and uncertain. It is the
only means \vith which our modem jurists have left us, for they have robbed us of the

other three means, the very ones which lead most quickly and reliably to the goal and which,
apart from the legal system,friendly nature has given to human beings in order to secure
their rightful freedom.' And these three means are - what do you think? - '(r) personal
obedience to, and inculcation of, the natural law; (2) resistance to injustice [Unrecht); and {]}
flight, when no other help is available.' (How unfriendly the jurists are in comparison
with friendly nature!) 'The natural and divine law, however, which all-bountiful nature
has given to everyone (Vol. I, p. 292), is: honour everyone as your equal' (on the author's
own principles, this ought to read: 'honour him who is not your equal, but is more

powerful than yourself); 'give offence to no one

who gives no offence to you; demand

nothing but what he owes to you' {but what does he owe?}; 'but more than this: love your
neighbour and serve him where you can.' - The implantation oJthis law is supposed to
render a legislation and constitution superfluous. It would be interesting to see how Herr
von Haller interprets the fact that, despite the implantation of this law, legislations and
constitutions have made their appearance in the world! In Volume Ill, pp. 362f., the

author comes to the 'so-called national liberties', i.e. the juridical and constitutional laws
of nations. (In this wider sense, every legally determined right may be described as a
liberty.) He says of these laws, among other things, 'that their content is usually very
insignificant, even if great value may be placed in books on such documentary liberties.'

When we see then that the author is here referring to the national liberties of the
German Imperial Estates,' of the English nation (such as the Magna ChartaS 'which is
lillie read, however, and even less understood on account of its archaic expressions', the Bill of
Rights6 etc.), of the Hungarian nation, etc., we are amazed to discover that these once so

280

Ethical Lifo
highly prized possessions are of no significance, and that it is

only itl books that these

nations place any value on their laws, which have had an effect on every gannent the
individual wears and every morsel of bread he eats, and whose effects are daily and
hourly present in everything. - If we may also mention the General Legal Code ofPmssia/
Herr von Haller speaks of it with particular disfavour (Vol. I, pp. r8Sff.) because
unphilosophical errors" (though not, at least, the Kantian philosophy, to which Herr von
Haller reacts with particular bitterness) have exerted an incredible influence on it, and
above all because it refers, among other things, to the state, the resources of the state, the
end of the state, the head of state, the dllties of the head of state, servants of the state, etc.
Worst of all, in Herr von Haller's opinion, is 'the right to impose ta.m on the private
resources of individuals, their trade, their production, or their consumption in order to
payfor the needs ofthe state; for this means that both the king himself (since the resources
of the state are not the private property of the sovereign, but the resources of the state
itself) and the Pmssian citizens have nothing oftheir own, neither their persons nor their
assets, and all subjects are serfi

the service ofthe state'.

in the eyes ofthe law, because they may not withdraw from

On top of all this incredible crudity, perhaps the most amusing touch is the emotion
Herr von Haller describes his inexpressible pleasure at his dis­
coveries (Vol. I, Preface [pp. xxiii-xxiv)) - 'a joy such as only the friend of truth can feel
when, after honest enquiry, he attains the certainty that . . . he has, so to speak (yes, 'so to

[Riihmng) with which

speak' indeed!), found the utterance of

nalllre,

the word of

God himself.

(On the

contrary, the word of God quite e}:pressly distinguishes its revelations from the
utterances of nature and of natural man.) He tells us 'how he could have fallen on his
knees in sheer wonderment, how a flood of joyful tears poured from his eyes, and living
religiosity arose from that moment within him'. - Herr von Haller's religiosity ought
rather to have bemoaned it as the harshest punishment imposed by God (for it is the
harshest judgement human beings can e""perience) that he had strayed so far from
thought and rationality, from respect for the laws, and from the knowledge

[Erkennltlis]

of how infinitely important and divine it is for the duties of the state and the rights of the
citizens to be determined by law - that he had strayed so far from all this that absurdity
was able to pass itself off in his eyes as the word of God.

"Translator's note:

Haller's text reads

nellphilosophiscllen Irrtiimer

('errors of modern

philosophy').

The Idea of the state
(a) has immediate actuality and is the individual state as a self-related
organism - the C01lstituti011 or c01lstitutio1lal law [i1l1leres Staatsrecht];
(b) passes over into the relatio1lship of the individual state to other
states - illlernatio1lal law [iiufleres Staatsrecht];
(c) is the universal Idea as a genus [Gattu1lg] and as an absolute power
in relation to individual states - the spirit which gives itself its
actuality in the process of world history.

Addition (G). The state as actual is essentially an individual state, and
beyond that a particular state. Individuality should be distinguished from
281

?

Philosophy ojRight
particularity; it is a moment within the very Idea of the state, whereas
particularity belongs to history. States as such are independent of one
another, and their relationship can consequently only be an external one,
so that there must be a third factor above them to link them together. This
third factor is in fact the spirit which gives itself actuality in world history
and is the absolute judge of states. Admittedly, several states may form a
league and sit in judgement, as it were, on other states, or they may enter
into alliances (like the Holy Alliance, / for example), but these are always
purely relative and limited, like [the ideal of] perpetual peace. The one
and only absolute judge which always asserts its authority over the par­
ticular is the spirit which has being in and for itself, and which reveals
itself as the universal and as the active genus in world history.

A. Constitutional Law
§ 260
The state is the actuality of concrete freedom. But concrete freedom
requires that personal individuality [Einzelheit] and its particular
interests should reach their full development and gain recognitio11 o/their
right for itself (within the system of the family and of civil society), and
also that they should, on the one hand, pass over of their own accord
into the interest of the universal, and on the other, knowingly and
willingly acknowledge this universal interest even as their own sub­
stantial spirit, and actively pursue it as their ultimate end. The effect of
this is that the universal does not attain validity or fulfilment without
the interest, knowledge, and volition of the particular, and that
individuals do not live as private persons merely for these particular
interests without at the same time directing their will to a universal
end [in tlnd fiir das Allgemeine wollen] and acting in conscious aware­
ness of this end. The principle of modern states has enormous
strength and depth because it allows the principle of subjectivity to
attain fulfilment in the self-sufficient extreme of personal particularity,
while at the same time bringing it back to substatztial unity and so
preserving this unity in the principle of subjectivity itself.

Addition (H,G). The Idea of the state in modem times has the distinctive
characteristic that the state is the actualization of freedom not in
accordance with subjective caprice, but in accordance with the concept of
the will, i.e. in accordance with its universality and divinity. Imperfect

282

Ethical Life

§§ 2 5 9-261

states are those in which the Idea of the state is still invisible [eingelziillt]
and where the particular detenninations of this Idea have not yet reached
free self-sufficiency. In the states of classical antiquity, universality was
indeed already present, but particularity [Partikularitiit] had not yet been
released and set at liberty and brought back to universality, i.e. to the
universal end of the whole. The essence of the modem state is that the
universal should be linked with the complete freedom of particularity
[Besonderlzeit] and the well-being of individuals, and hence that the inter­
est of the family and of civil society must become focused on the state; but
the universality of the end cannot make further progress without the
personal [eigene] knowledge and volition of the particular individuals [der
Besonderlzeit], who must retain their rights. Thus, the universal must be
activated, but SUbjectivity on the other hand must be developed as a living
whole. Only when both moments are present [bestelzen] in full measure
can the state be regarded as articulated and truly organized.

In relation to the spheres of civil law [Privatrecht] and private welfare,
the spheres of the family and civil society, the state is on the one hand
an external necessity and the higher power to whose nature their laws
and interests are subordinate and on which they depend. But on the
other hand, it is their immanent end, and its strength consists in the
unity of its universal and ultimate end with the particular interest of
individuals, in the fact that they have duties towards the state to the
same extent as they also have rights (see § I SS) .

As has already been noted (in the Remarks to § 3 above), it
was above all Montesquieu who, in his celebrated work
L 'Esprit des Lois, focused on and attempted to expound in
detail both the thought that laws, including those of civil law
in particular, are dependent on the specific character of the
state, and the philosophical view that the part should be con­
sidered only with reference to the whole.} Duty is primarily
an attitude towards something which, for me, is substantial and
universal in and for itself. Right, on the other hand, is in
general the existence [Dasein] of this substantial element, and is
consequently the latter's particular aspect and that of my own
particular freedom.z Thus, on a formal level, right and duty
appear to belong to different aspects or persons. In the state, as
an ethical entity and as the interpenetration of the substantial
-

Philosophy ofRight
and the particular, my obligation towards the substantial is at
the same time the existence of my particular freedom; that

ulIited within the state ill olle alld the same
relatioll [BeziehulIg]. But further, since the distinct moments
also attain their characteristic shape and reality within the state,
is, duty and right are

so that the distinction between right and duty again arises at
this point, these moments, although identical ill themselves (Le.
in a formal sense) are at the same time

differe1lt ill co1lte1lt.

In

the realms of civil law and morality, the relation [between
right and duty] lacks

actual necessity,

so that only an

abstract
what

equality of content is present; in these abstract spheres,

is right for one person ought also to be right for another, and

what is

one person's duty ought also to be another person's

duty. That absolute identity of duty and right [referred to
above] occurs here only as an equivalent identity of co1lte1lt, in
that the determination of the content is itself wholly universal;
that is, there is a single principle for both duty and right,
namely the personal freedom of human beings. Consequently,
slaves have no duties because they have no rights, and vice
versa. (Religious duties do not concern us here.)1 - But in the
internal development of the concrete Idea, its moments
become differentiated, and their determinacy becomes at the
same time a different content: in the family, the rights of the
son are not

the same ill collte1lt as the son's

father, and the rights of the citizen are not

duties towards his

the same ill cOllte1lt

as the citizen's duties towards the sovereign and government.
- The above concept of the union of duty and right is a factor

[Bestimm!mgj

of the greatest importance, and the inner

strength of states is embodied in it. - The abstract aspect of
duty consists simply in disregarding and excluding particular
interests as an inessential and even unworthy moment. But if
we consider the concrete aspect, Le. the Idea, we can see that
the moment of particularity is also essential, and that its
satisfaction is therefore entirely necessary; in the process of
fulfilling his duty, the individual must somehow attain his own
interest and satisfaction or settle his own account, and from

him
[Sachej becomes his OWll particular

whereby the universal cause

§§ 26r-262

cause. Particular interests should certainly not be set aside, let
alone suppressed; on the contrary, they should be harmonized
with the universal, so that both they themselves and the
universal are preserved. The individual, whose duties give
him the status of a subject [Unterta11], finds that, in fulfilling
his duties as a citizen, he gains protection for his person and
property, consideration for his particular welfare, satisfaction
of his substantial essence, and the consciousness and self­
awareness of being a member of a whole. And through his
performance of his duties as services and tasks undertaken on
behalf of the state, the state itself is preserved and secured.
Viewed in the abstract, the sole interest of the universal would
be [to ensure] that the tasks and services which it requires are
performed as duties.
Addition (H). Everything depends on the unity of the universal and the
particular within the state. In the states of antiquity, the subjective end
was entirely identical with the will of the state; in modem times, however,
we expect to have our own views, our own volition, and our own con­
science. The ancients had none of these in the present sense; for them,
the ultimate factor was the will of the state. Whereas, under the despotic
regimes of Asia, the individual has no inner life and no justification within
himself, in the modem world human beings expect their inner life to be
respected. The association of duty and right has a dual aspect, in that
what the" state requires as a duty should also in an immediate sense be the
right of individuals, for it is nothing more than the organization of the
concept of freedom. The determinations of the will of the individual
acquire an objective existence through the state, and it is only through the
state that they attain their truth and actualization. The state is the sole
precondition of the attainment of particular ends and welfare.

The actual Idea is the spirit which divides itself up into the two ideal
spheres of its concept - the family and civil society - as its finite
mode, and thereby emerges from its ideality to become infinite and
actual spirit for itself. In so doing, it allocates the material of its finite
actuality, i.e. individuals as a mass, to these two spheres, and in such a
way that, in each individual case [am Einzelllen], this allocation
285

Philosophy ofRight
appears to be

mediated by circumstances, by the individual's arbitrary
[eigene] choice of vocation [Bestimmung] (see § 1 85

will and personal

and the appended Remarks).l

Addition (H). In Plato's republic, subjective freedom is not yet recognized,
because individuals still have their tasks assigned to them by the authori­

ties [Obrigkeit].2 In many oriental states, this assignment is governed by
birth. But subjective freedom, which must be respected, requires
freedom of choice on the part of individuals.

In these spheres in which its moments, individuality

and

particularity, have their immediate and reflected reality, spirit is

present as their objective universality which

Addition (H).

The state, as spirit, is divided up into the particular
determinations of its concept or mode of being. If we take an example
from nature, the nervous system is, properly speaking, the system of
sensation: it is the abstract moment of being with oneself [bei siehl and of
thereby having one's own identity. But the analysis of sensation reveals
two aspects, and these are divided in such a way that both of them appear
as complete systems: the first is abstract feeling or self-containment, dull
internal movement, reproduction, inner self-nutrition, growth [Pro­
duzieren], and digestion. The second moment is that this being-with­
oneself stands in opposition to the moment of difference [Dijferenz] or
outward movement. This is irritability, the outward movement of sensa­
tion, which constitutes a system of its own, and there are lower classes of
animals which have developed this system exclusively as distinct from the
soul-governed unity of inner sensation. If we compare these natural
relations [NatllTbezielzll1lgen] with those of spirit, we must liken the family
to sensibility and civil society to irritability. Then the third factor is the
state, the nervous system itself [fiiT siclz], with its internal organization; but
it is alive only in so far as both moments - in this case, the family and civil
society - are developed within it. The laws which govern them are the
institutions of that rationality which manifests itself within them [des in sie
selzeillfmden Vemiilzftigell] . But the ground and ultimate truth of these
institutions is the spirit, which is their universal end and known object
[Gegenstatzd]. The family, too, is ethical, but its end is not a known end; in
civil society, however, separation is the detennining factor.

Ethical Life

Individuals as a mass are themselves spiritual natures, and they there­
fore embody a dual moment, namely the extreme of

individuality
[Einzelheit] which knows and wills for itself, and the extreme of U1livt1r­
sality which knows and wills the substantial. They can therefore attain
their right in both of these respects only in so far as they have actuality
both as private and as substantial persons. In the spheres in question
[Le. family and civil society], they attain their right in the first respect
directly; and in the second respect, they attain it by discovering their
essential self-consciousness in [social] institutions as that

universal

aspect of their particular interests which has being in itself, and by
obtaining through these institutions an occupation and activity direc­
ted towards a universal end within a corporation.

These institutions together form the

constitlltion - that is,

developed

and actualized rationality - in the realm of particularity, and they are
therefore the firm foundation of the state and of the trust and disposi­
tion of individuals towards it. They are the pillars on which public
freedom rests, for it is within them that particular freedom is realized
and rational; hence the union of freedom and necessity is present

iTI

itselfwithin these institutions.
Addition (G). It has already been noted that the sanctity of marriage and

the institutions in which civil society takes on an ethical appearance
constitute the stability of the whole - that is, the universal is
simultaneously the concern [Sache] of each [individual] as a particular
[entity]. What matters most is that the law of reason should merge with
the law of particular freedom, and that my particular end should become
identical with the universal; otherwise, the state must hang in the air. It is
the self-awareness of individuals which constitutes the actuality of the
state, and its stability consists in the identity of the two aspects in ques­
tion. It has often been said that the end of the state is the happiness of its
citizens. This is certainly true, for if their welfare is deficient, if their
subjective ends are not satisfied, and if they do not find that the state as
such is the means to this satisfaction, the state itself stands on an insecure
footing.

necessity in ideality is the development of the Idea within itself; as

internally articulated, and which posits differences within itself through
which it completes its cycle.

The political disposition, i.e. patriotism in general, is certainty based on

(whereas merely subjective certainty does not originate in

but is only opinion) and a volition which has become

such, it is merely a consequence of the institutions within the state, a
consequence in which rationality is

aaually present, just as rationality

receives its practical application through action in conformity with the
state's institutions. - This disposition is in general one of tmst (which
may pass over into more or less educated insight), or the conscious­
ness that my substantial and particular interest is preserved and con­
tained in the interest and end of an other (in this case, the state), and
in the latter's relation to me as an individual

[a/s Eilzzehzem] . As

a

result, this other immediately ceases to be an other for me, and in my
consciousness of this, I am free.
Patriotism is frequently understood to mean only a willingness
to perform extraordillary sacrifices and actions. But in essence,

It IS that disposition which, in the normal conditions and

circumstances of life, habitually knows that the community is
the substantial basis and end. It is this same consciousness,
tried and tested in all circumstances of ordinary life, which
underlies the willingness to make extraordinary efforts. But
just as human beings often prefer to be guided by
magnanimity instead of by right, so also do they readily con­
vince themselves that they possess this extraordinary patriot­
ism in order to exempt themselves from the genuine
disposition, or to excuse their lack of it. - Furthermore, if we
take this disposition to be something which can originate
independently [fUr sich] and arise out of subjective represen­
tations [Vorstelltmgen] and thoughts, we are confusing it with
opinion; for in this interpretation, it is deprived of its true
ground, i.e. objective reality.

Addition (H). Uneducated people delight in argument [Riisollieretz] and
fault-finding, for it is easy to find fault, but difficult to recognize the good
and its inner necessity. Education in its early stages always begins with
fault-finding, but when it is complete, it sees the positive element in
everything. In religion, it is equally easy to say that this or that is supersti­
tion, but it is infinitely more difficult to comprehend the truth which it
contains. Thus people's apparent political disposition should be dis­
tinguished from what they genuinely will; for inwardly, they in fact will the
thing [Sache], but they fasten on to details and delight in the vanity of
c1ainIing superior insight. They trust that the state" will continue to exist
[bestelzetz] and that particular interests can be fulfilled within it alone; but
habit blinds us to the basis of our entire existence [Existetzz]. It does not
occur to someone who walks the streets in safety at night that this might
be otherwise, for this habit of [living in] safety has become second nature,
and we scarcely stop to think that it is solely the effect of particular
institutions. Representational thought often imagines that the state is held
together by force; but what holds it together is simply the basic sense of
order which everyone possesses.

§ 26 9
The r,politicalJ disposition takes its particularly detennined content
from the various aspects of the organism of the state. This organism is
the development of the Idea in its differences and their objective
actuality. These different aspects are accordingly the various powers
[within the state] with their corresponding tasks and functions,
through which the universal continually produces itself. It does so in a
necessary way, because these various powers are detennined by the
nature ofthe concept; and it preserves itself in so doing, because it is itself
the presupposition of its own production. This organism is the politi­
cal constitution.
Addition (G). The state is an organism, i.e. the development of the Idea in
its differences. These different aspects are accordingly the various powers
with their corresponding tasks and functions, through which the universal
continually produces itself in a necessary way and thereby preserves itself,
because it is itself the presupposition of its own production. This organ­
ism is the political constitution; it proceeds perpetually from the state, just
as it is the means by which the state preserves itself. If the two diverge and
the different aspects break free, the unity which the constitution produces
is no longer established. The fable of the belly and the other members is
relevant here.} It is in the nature of an organism that all its parts must
perish if they do not achieve identity and if one of them seeks
independence. Predicates, principles, and the like get us nowhere in
assessing the state, which must be apprehended as an organism, just as
predicates are of no help in comprehending the nature of God, whose life
must instead be intuited as it is in itself.2

The fact that the end of the state is both the universal interest as such
and the conservation of particular interests within the universal inter­
est as the substance of these constitutes (1) the abstract actuality or
substantiality of the state. But this substantiality is (2) the necessity of
the state, for it divides itself up into the conceptual differences within
the state's functions; and these differences, by virtue of this substan­
tiality, are likewise actual and fixed detenninations or powers. (3) But
this very substantiality is the spirit which knows and wills itself as
having passed through the form of education. The state therefore knows
2 90

Ethical Lift
what it wills, and knows it in its universality as something thought.
Consequendy, it acts and functions in accordance with known ends
and recognized principles, and with laws which are laws not only in
themselves but also for the consciousness; and it likewise acts in deter­
minate knowledge [Ke1l1Itnis] of existing circumstances and relations
in so far as its actions have relevance to these.
This is the point at which we must touch on the state's relation
to religion,i because it has repeatedly been maintained in
recent times that religion is the foundation of the state, and
has even been presumed that this assertion constitutes the
whole of political science. No assertion is more apt to produce
so much confusion, or indeed to set up confusion itself as the
political constitution and the form which cognition ought to
take. - It may at first seem suspicious that people recommend
and resort to religion above all in times of public distress,
disruption, and oppression, and that they are referred to it for
consolation in the face of wrong and for hope as a compensa­
tion for loss. When it is further regarded as a precept of
religion that we ought to treat worldly interests and the course
of actual events with indifference, despite the fact that the
state is the spirit which is present in the world, this religious
advice does not seem calculated to promote the interest and
business of the state as an essential and serious end. On the
contrary, it seems to represent the entire political regime as a
matter [Sache] of indifference and arbitrariness, either
because it is formulated in such a way as to suggest that the
state is dominated by the ends of passion, unjust [ullrechtlicher]
force, and the like, or because such religious advice attempts
to retain exclusive validity and claims authority to determine
and administer [the process of] right. Although it may seem
derisive to dismiss all resentment towards tyranny by declar­
ing that the oppressed find consolation in religion, it should
not be forgotten that religion can take on a form which leads
to the harshest servitude within the fetters of superstition and
to the debasement of human beings to a level below that ofthe
animals (as among the Egyptians and Indians, who venerate
animals as higher beings).2 This phenomenon [Erscheimmg]
may at least draw our attention to the fact that we ought not to
291

Philosophy ofRight
speak of religion in wholly general terms, and that we instead
require a power to rescue us from it in some of the shapes it
assumes and to champion the rights of reason and self-con­
sciousness. - But the essential determinant of the relationship
between religion and the state can be discovered only if we
recall the concept of religion. The content of religion is
absolute truth, and it is therefore associated with a disposition
of the most exalted kind. As intuition, feeling, and represen­
tational cognition [vorstellende Erkennt11is] whose concern is
with God as the unlimited foundation and cause on which
everything depends, it contains the requirement that every­
thing else should be seen in relation [Bezielmng] to this and
should receive confirmation, justification, and the assurance
of certainty from this source. It is within this relationship that
the state, laws, and duties all receive their highest endorse­
ment as far as the consciousness is concerned, and become
supremely binding upon it; for even the state, laws, and duties
are in their actuality something determinate which passes over
into the higher sphere as that in which its foundation lies (see
Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences, § 453).3 Religion
therefore also contains that point which, in spite of all change,
failure of actual ends and interests, and loss of possessions,
affords a consciousness of immutability and of the highest
freedom and satisfaction.f If, then, religion constitutes the
jOtl1ldatiotl which embodies the ethical realm ill general, and,
more specifically, the nature of the state as the divine will, it is
at the same time only a jOtl1ldatiotl; and this is where the two
[i.e. the state and religion] diverge. The state is the divine will
as present spirit, ulljOldi,1g as the actual shape and organization
of a world. - Those .who refuse to go beyond the form of
religion when confronted by the state behave like those who,
tHegel's note: Religion, like cognition and science, has as its principle a distinct form which is

different from that of the state. All of these therefore enter into the state, partly as means
to education and the [appropriate] disposition, and partly in so far as they are essentially

ends in themselves inasmuch as they have an external existence [Dasein]. In both respects,
the principles of the state are applicable to them. A comprehensively concrete treatise on
the state would also have to consider these spheres, as well as art, purely natural
circumstances, etc., in their relevance [Be:::iellllng] to and position within the state. In the
present treatise, however, in which it is the principle of the state which is expounded in
its own distinct sphere and in accordance with its Idea, the principles of these other areas
and the applicatiOl/ of the right of the state to them can be mentioned only in passing.

292

Ethical Life
in the cognitive realm, claim to be right even if they invariably
stop at the essetlce instead of proceeding beyond this abstrac­
tion to existence [Dasein], or like those who (see Remarks to
§ 1 40 above) will only the abstract good and leave it to the
arbitrary will to determine what is good. Religion is the rela­
tion to the absolute in the flml of feeling, representational
thought, and foith, and within its all-embracing centre, every­
thing is merely accidental and transient. If, then, we also
adhere to this form in relation [Beziehwlg] to the state and act
as if it were the essentially valid and determining factor in this
[political] context, too, we thereby expose the state, as an
organism within which lasting [bestehetlde] differences, laws,
and institutions have developed, to instability, insecurity, and
disruption. The laws, as the objective and universal element
[within the state], no longer have a lasting and valid
determination, but take on a negative determination in rela­
tion to that form [of religion] which veils over everything
determinate and thereby assumes a subjective character. The
consequence for human behaviour is [such advice as] 'To the
righteous, no law is given', 'Be pious, and you may otherwise
do as you please', or 'You may abandon yourselves to your
own arbitrariness and passion, and refer others who thereby
suffer wrong to the solace and hope of religion, or (even
worse) dismiss and condemn them as irreligious'.4 If,
however, this negative attitude does not simply remain an
inward disposition and viewpoint, but turns instead to the
actual world and asserts itself within it, it leads to religious
fonaticism which, like political fanaticism, repudiates all politi­
cal institutions and legal order as restrictive limitations
[Sclzranketl] on the inner emotions and as incommensurate
with the infinity of these, and hence also rejects private prop­
erty, marriage, the relationships and tasks of civil society, etc.
as unworthy of love and the freedom of feeling. Since,
however, decisions still have to be made in relation to actual
existence [Dasein] and action, the same thing happens as in
the case of that subjectivity of the will in general which knows
itself to be absolute (see § 1 40), namely that the decisions are
made on the basis of subjective representations [Vorstellung],
i.e. of opinion and the caprice ofthe arbitral}' will. - The truth,
however - as opposed to this truth which veils itself in the
29 3

Philosophy ofRight
subjectivity of feeling and representational thinking - is the
momentous transition of the inner to the outer, that
incorporation [Ei1lbildtmg] of reason into reality which the
whole of world history has worked to achieve. Through this
work, educated humanity has actualized and become con­
scious of rational existence [Dasei1l], political institutions, and
laws. Those who 'seek the Lord' and assure themselves, in
their uneducated opinion, that they possess everything
immediately instead of undertaking the work of raising their
subjectivity to cognition of the truth and knowledge of objec­
tive right and duty, can produce nothing but folly, outrage,
and the destruction of all ethical relations. These are necess­
ary consequences of that religious disposition which insists
exclusively on its form, and so turns against actuality and the
truth which is present in universal form within the laws. But
this disposition need not necessarily proceed to actualize itself
in this way. With its negative point of view, it may well retain
its inward character, conform to [social] institutions and laws,
and simply resign itself to these with sighs, or with contempt
and longing. It is not strength but weakness which, in our
times, has turned religiosity into a polemical kind of piety,
whether this is associated with a genuine need- or merely with
unsatisfied vanity. Instead of mastering one's opinions by the
labour of study and subjecting one's volition to discipline so as
to elevate it to free obedience, the easiest course is to
renounce cognition of objective truth, to nurse a sense of
grievance and hence also of self-conceit, and to find in one's
own godliness all that is required in order to see through the
nature of the laws and of political institutions, to pass judge­
ment on them, and to lay down what their character should
and must be. And indeed, since these are the findings of a
pious heart, they must be infallible and indisputable; for if we
make religion the basis of our intentions and assertions, these
cannot be faulted on account of either their shallowness or
their injustice [U1lreclltlichkeit].s
But if the religion in question is of a genuine kind and does
not have this negative and polemical attitude towards the
state, but acknowledges and endorses it, it will also have a
status [Zusta1ld] and expressio1l of its own [Ilir sich]. The busi2 94

l

Ethical Life
ness of its worship consists in aaions and in dnctrine; for these,
it requires possessi011s and property, as well as individuals dedi­
cated to the service of the community. A relationship thus
arises between the state and the religious community, and its
detennination is a simple one. It is in the nature of the case
[Sache] that the state fulfils a duty by giving the [religious]
community every assistance and protection in the pursuit of its
religious end. Indeed, since religion is that moment which
integrates the state at the deepest level of the disposition [of
its citizens], the state ought even to require all its citizens to
belong to such a community - but to any community they
please, for the state can have no say in the content [of religious
belief] in so far as this relates to the internal dimension of
representational thought. A state which is strong because its
organization is fully developed can adopt a more liberal
attitude in this respect, and may completely overlook
individual matters [Einzelheiten] which might affect it, or even
tolerate communities whose religion does not recognize even
their direct duties towards the state (although this naturally
depends on the numbers concerned). It is able to do this by
entrusting the members of such communities to civil society
and its laws, and is content if they fulfil their direct duties
towards it passively, for example by commutation or substitu­
tion [of an alternative service].t But in so far as the religious
tHegel's nole: Of Quakers, Anabaptists, etc., it may be said that they are active members
only of civil society and that, as private persons, they have purely private relations with
other people: Even in this context, they have been exempted from taking oaths; they fulfil
their direct duties towards the state in a passive manner, and although they reject
outright one of the most important of these, namely the defence of the state against its
enemies, they may even be allowed to fulfil this duty by substituting another service
instead.6 Towards such sects, the state practises loleralion in the proper sense of the
word; for since they do not recognize their duties towards it, they cannot claim the right
to belong to it. When, on one occasion, there was a strong movement in the American
Congress to abolish negro slavery, a member from the southern states aptly retorted:
'Leave us our negroes and you can keep your Quakers.' - Only if the state is strong in
other respects can it overlook and tolerate such anomalies, relying above all on the power
of custom and the inner rationality of its institutions to reduce and overcome the
discrepancy if the state does not strictly enforce its rights in this respect. For example,
although it may well have been contrary to formal right to grant even civil rights to the
Jews, on the grounds that the latter should be regarded not just as a particular religious
group but also as members of a foreign nation [Volk], the outcry which this viewpoint and
others produced overlooked the fact that the Jews are primarily human beings; this is not
just a neutral and abstract quality (see Remarks to § 209), for its consequence is that the

2 95

Philosophy ojRight
community owns property and otherwise performs acts of wor­
ship with the help of individuals employed for this purpose, it
emerges from the inner realm into that of worldly affairs and
hence into the province of the state, thereby placing itself
immediately under its laws. It is true that the oath and the
ethical realm in general, including the marriage relationship,
involve that inner penetration and elevation of the dispositio1l
which is confirmed at the profoundest level by religion. [But]
since ethical relations are essentially relations of actual ratio1l­
ality, the rights of this rationality must first be asserted within
them, and the confirmation of the Church is then added to
these rights as their purely inward and more abstract aspect. As for the other ways in which the Church community expres­
ses itself, the inward [dimension] predominates over the
outward to a greater extent in matters of doctritle than in acts of
worship and other related kinds of behaviour, in which it is at
once apparent that the legal [redltlidle] aspect at least is in
itself [fUr sidl] a matter [Sache] for the state. (Admittedly,
Churches have also contrived to exempt their servants and
property from the authority [Macht] and jurisdiction of the
state, and have even acquired jurisdiction over laymen in
matters such as divorce proceedings, the taking of oaths, etc.,
in which religion plays a part.) - The role of the police with
regard to such actions is, of course, more indeterminate, but
this lies in the nature of their function and applies equally to
other purely civil activities (see § 234 above). Whenever
individuals of the same religious persuasion join together to
form a community or corporation, the latter will in general be
subject to the policing and supervision of the state. - Doctri1le
itself, however, has its province within the conscience, and
granting of chil rights gives those who receive them a se!f-awaretless as recognized legal
[rechrliche] persons in chiJ society, and it is from this root, infinite and free from all other

7
influences, that the desired assimilation in terms of attitude and disposition arises. [If
they had not been granted civil rights,] the Jews would have remained in that isolation
with which they have been reproached, and this would rightly have brought blame
[Schuld] and reproach upon the state which excluded them; for the state would thereby
have failed to recognize its own principle as an objective institution with a power of its
own (cf. the end of the Remarks to § 268). While the demand for the exclusion of the
Jews claimed to be based on the highest right, it has proved in practice to be the height of
folly, whereas the way in which governments have acted has proved wise and
honourable.8

296

Ethical Life
enjoys the right of the subjective freedom of self-conscious­
ness, that sphere of inwardness which is not, as such, the
province of the state. Nevertheless, the state, too, has its
doctrine, for its institutions and whatever it recognizes as valid
in relation to right, to the constitution, etc. are present essen­
tially in the form of thought as law. And since the state is not a
mechanism but the rational life of self-conscious freedom and
the system of the ethical world, the

disposition

[of its citizens],

and so also the[ir] consciousness of this disposition in

principles,

is an essential moment in the actual state. But the

doctrine of the Church is in tum not just an internal matter
for the conscience; as doctrine, it is in fact an

expreSSiotl,

indeed the expression of a content which is intimately connec­
ted, or even directly concerned, with ethical principles and
with the laws of the state. Thus, state and Church are at this
point either in direct

agreemetlt

or in direct

opposition.

The

Church may go so far as to present the difference between
their respective provinces as an abrupt opposition, for it may
take the view that, since the Church embodies the absolute
content of religion, the

spiritual in general and hence also the

ethical element are part of its concern, whereas the state is a
mechanical framework serving non-spiritual and external
ends. The Church may look on itself as the kingdom of God,
or at least as the road and forecourt which lead to it, yet regard
the state as the kingdom of the world, i.e. of the transitory and
finite; in other words, it may see itself as an end in itself, but
the state purely as a

means. And as far as doctrinal instnlctiotl is

concerned, these claims may be coupled ,vith the demand that
the state should not only grant the Church complete freedom
in such matters, but should also treat its teachings, as doc­
trines, with unconditional respect, regardless of what they
may contain, on the grounds that the Church is alone respon­
sible for determining them. But while the Church bases these
claims on the far-reaching argument

[Griinde] that the
science and cogni­

spiritual element in general is its property,

tion in general are also represented in this province and, like a
Church, develop into a totality ,vith its own distinct principle
which may consider itself as occupying the same position as
the Church, but ,vith even greater justification. Thus, science

may also demand the same independence from the state, and
treat the latter simply as a means which should provide for it
as an end in itself. Furthermore, it makes no difference to
this relationship [between Church and state] whether the
individuals and heads of congregations who devote them­
selves to the service of the religious community have gone so
far as to lead an existence [Existet1z] separate from the state, so
that only the other members of their community are subject to
its control, or whether they remain in other respects within
the state and regard their ecclesiastical vocation [Besti11l11lU1lg]
merely as one aspect of their social status [Stand] which they
keep separate from the state. It should in the first place be
noted that such a relationship is associated with that view
[Vorstellung] of the state according to which its sole function
[Besti11l1/lung] is to protect and secure the life, property, and
arbitrary will of everyone, in so far as the latter does not
infringe the life, property, and arbitrary will of others; in this
view, the state is merely an arrangement dictated by necessity
[Not]. In this way, the higher spiritual element of what i' true
in and for itself is placed, as subjective religiosity or theoreti­
cal science, beyond the [confines of the] state which, as the
laity in and for itself, should merely show respect [for this
element] and is thus completely deprived of its proper ethical
character. We do indeed know from history that there have in
the past been periods and conditions of barbarism in which all
higher spirituality had its seat in the Church, while the state
was merely a secular regime of violence, arbitrariness, and
passion and the abstract opposition [of Church and state]
referred to above was the main principle of actuality (see
§ 3 58).9 But to claim that this situation is the one which truly
corresponds to the Idea is to proceed too blindly and super­
ficially. On the contrary, the development of this Idea has
established the truth [of the proposition] that spirit, as free
and rational, is inherently [an sidl] ethical, that the true Idea is
adual rationality, and that it is this rationality which exists as
the state. It has further emerged just as plainly from this Idea
that the ethical tntth which it embodies is present for thinking
consciousness as a collfet1t on which the form of universality
has been conferred - i.e. as law and that the state in general
-

298

Ethical Life
knows its ends, and recognizes and implements them with a
determinate consciousness and in accordance with principles.
Now religion, as already remarked, has the truth as its univer­
sal object [Gegellstami], but as a giVell content whose basic
determinations have not been recognized in terms of concepts
and thought. In the same way, the relation of the individual to
this object is an obligation based on authority, and the wiwess
of his own spirit and heart, as that in which the moment of
freedom is contained, is foith and fteling [Empfindtl1lg]. It is
philosophical insight which recognizes that Church and state
are not opposed to each other as far as their co1lfellt is con­
cerned, which is truth and rationality, but merely differ in
form. Thus, when the Church proceeds to put forward doc­
trines (although there are and have been Churches which
confine themselves to worship, and others in which worship is
the principal concern, and doctrine and a more educated
consciousness are merely secondary), and its doctrines relate
to objective principles, to ethical and rational thoughts, its
expression of these doctrines immediately brings it into the
province of the state. In contrast with the foith and authority of
the Church in relation to ethics, right, laws, and instiWtions,
and with its subjective conviction, the state possesses knowledge.
Within its principle, the content is no longer essentially con­
fined to the form of feeling and faith, but belongs to determi­
nate thought. When the content which has being in and for
itself appears in the shape of religion as a particular content,
as the doctrines peculiar to the Church as a religious com­
munity, they remain outside the domain of the state. (In Pro­
testantism, there is no laity, so that there is likewise no clergy
to act as an exclusive depositary of Church doctrine.) Since
ethical principles and the organization of the state in general
may be drawn into the province of religion and not only may,
but also should, be framed with reference to the latter, this
reference gives the state itself its religious accreditation. On
the other hand, the state retains the right and form of self­
conscious, objective rationality, the right to enforce the latter
and to defend it against assertions based on the subjective
variety [Gestalt] of truth, no matter what assurances and auth­
ority this truth may carry with it. Since the essential principle
299

Philosophy ofRight
of the fonn of the state as a universal is thought, it was in fact

from the state that freedom of thought and seiertce first emerged
(whereas it was a Church which burned Giordano Bruno1o
and forced Galileo to recant on his knees for expou11ding the
Copernican theory of the solar system/I etc.).t Thus, seiertce,
too, is to be found on the side of the state, for it has the same
element of fonn as the state, and its end is cognitioll, by means
of thought, of objective truth and rationality. Thinking cogni­
tion may admittedly fall from [the level of] science to [that of]
opinion and deductive reasoning [Riisonierert aIlS Griilldell]
and, turning its attention to ethical subjects and the organiza­
tion of the state, set itself up in contradiction to their
principles. And it may in so doing make the same pretensions
as the Church makes for its own distinctive sphere, namely by
presenting its opiniolls as reason, and as the right of the sub­
jective self-consciousness to freedom of opinion and convictHegel's

this movement was pronounced heretical by an assembly of cardinals, and Galileo, its
most famous advocatC;wassuiiimoiledbe fore the court of the Inquisition and compelled
to recant it in order to escape a harsh prison sentence. In a man of intellect [Geist], one of
the strongest passions is the passion for truth. Galileo, convinced of the earth's move­
ment by his own observations, reflected for a long time over a new work in which he
intended to develop all the proofs in its favour. But in order to avoid that persecution to
which he would otherwise certainly have fallen victim, he adopted the stratagem of
presenting these proofs in the form of dialogues between three individuals. It is obvious
enough that the advocate of the Copernican system has the advantage; but since Galileo
did not pronounce a verdict, and since he gave as much weight as possible to the
objections advanced by the adherents of Ptolemy, he was entitled to expect that he would
be left to enjoy unmolested that peace which his advanced years and labours had earned
for him. In his seventieth year, he was again summoned before the tribunal of the
Inquisition; he was put in prison, and there required to recant his opinions for a second
time, under threat of the penalty laid down for relapsed heretics. He was made to sign
the follo\\iug formula of abjuration: "I, Galileo, having appeared in person before the
court in my seventieth year, on bended knee and \\;th the holy Gospels before my eyes
and in my hands, abjure, damn, and curse, \vith sincere heart and true belief, the
absurdity, falsity, and heresy of the doctrine of the earth's movement", etc. What a
spectacle, to see a venerable old man, famed throughout a long life devoted solely to the
study of nature, abjuring on his knees and against the testimony of his own conscience
that truth which he had convincingly demonstrated! A judgement of the Inquisition
condemned him to imprisonment in perpetuity. A year later, on the intercession of the
Grand Duke of Florence, he was set at liberty. He died in 1 642. His loss was mourned
throughout Europe, which his labours had enlightened and which was incensed at the
judgement passed by a hated tribunal on so great a man.'

tion. The principle of this subjectivity of knowledge has

already been discussed above (see Remarks to § 1 40). All that
need be mentioned here is that the attitude of the state
towards

opinion - in so far as it is merely opinion, a subjective

content which therefore has no true inner force and power,
however grandiose its claims - is on the one hand one of
infinite indifference, like that of the painters who stick to the
three primary colours on their palettes, regardless of the

wisdom ofthe schools which tells them that there are seven. But
on the other hand, when these opinions based on bad
principles give themselves a universal existence [Dasein]
which undermines actuality, the state must protect objective
truth and the principles of ethical life; and it must do the same
if the formalism of unconditional subjectivity should seek to
make science its basis and starting-point, and to turn the
state's own educational establishments against it by inciting
them to make pretensions akin to those of a Church. And
conversely, when confronted with a Church which claims
unlimited and unconditional

authority,

the state must on the

whole assert the formal right of self-consciousness to its own
insight and conviction, and in general to thoughts concerning
what should count as objective truth.
The

unity oJstate and Church, a subject [Bestimmung] which

has likewise been much discussed and held up as an ultimate
ideal in recent times, may also be mentioned here.12 Although
their essential unity lies in the truth of principles and disposi­
tion, it is just as essential that, along with this unity, the

differe1lce between their forms of consciousness should attain
partiCll!ar existe1lce [Existe1lz]. That unity of Church and state
which has so often been wished for is to be found in oriental
despotism - but in this case, there is no state in the sense of
that self-conscious configuration

[Gesta!tzwg]

of right, of free

ethical life, and of organic development which is alone worthy
of the spirit. - Furthermore, if the state is to attain existence
[Dasein] as the

self-Imowing ethical actuality of spirit, its form

must become distinct from that of authority and faith. But this
distinction emerges only in so far as the Church for its part
becomes divided within itself. Only then, [when it stands]
above the partiCll!ar Churches, can the state attain
301

universality

�I

Philosophy ojRight
of thought as its formal principle and bring it into existence

[Existenz];

but in order to recognize this, one must know not

only what universality is

[Existenz]

in itself,

but also what its

existence

is. Consequently, far from it being, or ever having

been, a misfortune for the state if the Church is divided, it is

through this division alone that the state has been able to fulfil
its destiny [Bestimmung] as self-conscious rationality and ethi­
cal life. This division is likewise the most fortunate thing
which could have happened to the Church and to thought as
far as their freedom and rationality are concerned.

Additi01z (H). The state is actual, and its actuality consists in the fact that
the interest of the whole realizes itself through the particular ends. Actu­

ality is always the unity of universality and particularity, the resolu�f

���o be self-sufficient,

although it is sustained and supported only by the whole. If this unity is
not present, nothing can be aaual, even if it may be assumed to have
existence [Existetzz]. A bad state is one which merely exists; a sick body also

exists, but it has no true reality. A hand which has been cut off still looks

like a hand and exists, but it has no actualityP True actuality is necessity:
what is actual is necessary in itself. Necessity consists

[beste/zt]

in the

division of the whole into the distinctions within the concept, and in the
fact that this divided whole exhibits a fixed and enduring determinacy
which is not dead and unchanging but continues to produce itself in its
dissolution.

An essential part of the fully developed state is consciousness

or thought; the state accordingly knows what it wills and knows this as an
object of thought

[eill Gedaclztes].

Since, then, the seat of knowledge is

within the state, science also has its seat

here and not within the Church.

This notwithstanding, there has been much talk in recent times to the
effect that the state should grow out of religion. The state is [fully]
developed spirit and it displays its moments in the light of consciousness;

and the fact that what lies within the Idea emerges into [the sphere of]
objectivity

[Gegetlstibldlichkeit]

means that the state appears as a finite

entity and is thereby shown to be a secular realm

[Gebiet], whereas reli­

gion presents itself as a realm of infinity. The state consequently seems
subordinate, and since the finite cannot exist on its own
it allegedly requires the Church as its basis.

[fiir sich bestehetz],
As a finite entity, it is said to

lack justification, and only through religion can it be sanctified and belong

to the infinite. But this view of the matter [Sache] is extremely one-sided.

The state is indeed essentially secular and finite, and has particular ends

and particular powers; but its secularity is only one of its aspects, and only
a spiritless perception can regard it as merely finite. For the state has a

302

T

Ethical Life
soul which animates it, and this animating soul is subjectivity, which
creates distinctions on the one hand but preserves their unity on the
other. In the realm [Reich] of religion, distinctions and finite elements are
also present. God, it is said, is three in one; there are accordingly three
determinations, and it is only the unity of these which constitutes the
spirit. Consequently, if we apprehend the divine nature in concrete terms,
this can be done only by means of distinctions. Thus, finite elements are
to be found in the divine realm as well as in the secular, and [to contend]
that the secular spirit, i.e. the state, is purely finite is a one-sided view, for
actuality is not irrational.

A

bad state, of course, is purely secular and

finite, but the rational state is infinite within itself. Secondly, it is argued
that the state should derive its justification from religion. The Idea, within
[the context of] religion, is spirit internalized in emotion, but it is this

same Idea which gives itself secular expression in the state and secures an
existence [Dasein] and actuality for itself in knowledge and volition. Thus,
to say that the state must be founded on religion may mean that it should
be based on and grow out of rationality. But the same proposition can also
be misunderstood to mean that those human beings whose spirit is fet­
tered by an unfree religion are best equipped to obey. The Christian
religion, however, is the religion of freedom - although it may come about
that this freedom is perverted into unfreedom under the influence of
superstition. If, then, the above proposition means that individuals must
have religion in order that their fettered spirit can be more effectively
oppressed within the state, its sense is a bad one; but

if it is

meant that

human beings should have respect for the state as that whole of which

they are the branches, the best way of achieving this is, of course, through
philosophical insight into its essence. But

if this

insight is lacking, the

religious disposition may lead to the same result. Consequently, the state
may have need of religion and faith. But the state remains essentially
different from religion, for what it requires has the shape of a legal

[reclztlichen] duty, and it is indifferent to the emotional attitude with which
this duty is performed. The field of religion, on the other hand, is inward­
ness; and just as the state would prejudice the right of inwardness if it
imposed its requirements in a religious manner, so also does the Church,

if it acts

like a state and imposes penalties, degenerate into a tyrannical

religion.

A third

difference, connected with that just mentioned, is that

the content of religion is and remains latent
feeling

[EmPfindu1zg],

[ei1zgelziillt],

so that emotion,

and representational thought are the ground on

which it rests. On this ground, everything has the form of subjectivity,
whereas the state actualizes itself and gives its determinations a stable
existence [Dasein]. Thus, if religiosity sought to assert itself in the state in
the manner which it usually adopts on its own ground, it would subvert

Philosophy ofRight

:. \

the organization of the state; for the differences within the state are far
apart, whereas everything in religion invariably has reference to the
totality. And if this totality sought to take over all the relations [Bezie­
htmgen1 of the state, it would become fanaticism; it would wish to find the
whole in every particular, and could accomplish this only by destroying
the particular, for fanaticism is simply the refusal to admit particular
differences. If we may so put it, the saying 'Laws are not made for the
pious' is no more than an expression of this fanaticism. For when piety
adopts the role of the state, it cannot endure anything determinate, but
simply destroys it. It is also in keeping with this if piety leaves decisions to
the conscience, to inwardness, and is not determined by reasons; for
inwardness does not develop reasons and is not accountable to itself.
Thus, if piety is to count as the actuality of the state, all laws are swept
aside and it is subjective feeling which legislates. This feeling may be pure
arbitrariness, and it is only by its actions that we can tell whether or not
this is so. But in so far as they are actions or precepts, they assume the
shape of laws, and this is in direct contradiction to the subjective feeling
referred to. God, as the object [Gegenstand] of this feeling, might also be
made the determinant; but God is the universal Idea which remains
indeterminate within this feeling, and which is not sufficiently mature to
determine what exists in developed form within the state. The very fact
that everything in the state is stable and secure is a defence against
arbitrariness and positive opinion. Thus, religion as such should not hold
the reins of government.

fhe political constitution is,jirst, the organization of the state and the
process of its organic life with reference to itself, in which it differen­
tiates its moments within itself and develops them to established

existence [zum Besteh{m].
Secondly, the state in

its individuality is an exclusive unit which
accordingly has relations with others; it thereby turns its differentiation
outwards and, in accordance with this determination, posits its existing
[bestehenden] differences within itself in their ideality.

Addition (H).

Just as irritability in the living organism is itself in one
respect an inward quality which belongs to the organism as such, so also
in the present case is the outward reference directed towards inwardness.
The inward aspect of the state as such is the civil power, and its outward
direction is the military power, although the latter is also a specific aspect
within the state itself. The equilibrium of these two aspects is an import-

Ethical Life

§§ 270-272

ant factor in the history" of the state. Sometimes the civil power is com­
pletely defunct and based exclusively on the military power, as at the time
of the Roman emperorsb and the praetorians/ and at other times - as in
the modern period - the military power is solely a product of the civil
power, as when all citizens are eligible for conscription.2
"Translalor's nole: The word Gesinnung ('disposition'), which appears at this point in all of
those editions of the Reehtsphilosophie which include Gans's Additions, should read
Gesehic1l1e ('history') as in Hotho's notes, used by Gans as the basis of this Addition (see
VPR III, 742). The error is presumably a misreading by Gans.
bTranslalor's nole: The remainder of this sentence appears to be Gans's own interpola­
tion, as it has no counterpart in either Hotho's or Griesheim's notes.

I The Internal Constitution'

The constitution is rational in so far as the state differentiates and
determines its activity within itself in accordance with the nature of the
concept. It does so in such a way that each of the powers in question is in
itself the totality, since each contains the other moments and has them
active within it, and since all of them, as expressions of the differenti­
ation [UnterschiedJ of the concept, remain wholly within its ideality and
constitute nothing but a single individual whole.
In recent times, ,we have heard an endless amount of empty
talk both about;the constitution and about reason itself. The
most vapid of this has come from those in Germany who have
persuaded themselves that they have a better understanding
than anyone else - especially governments - of what a con­
stitution is, and who believe that all their superficialities are
irrefutably justified because they are allegedly based on reli­
gion and piety. It is no wonder that such talk has made
reasonable men [Miinner] sick of the words 'reason',
'enlightenment', 'right', etc., and likewise of the words 'con­
stitution' and 'freedom', and that one is almost ashamed to
enter into any further discussion of political constitutions. I
But it may at least be hoped that such excesses will lead to a
more widespread conviction that philosophical cognition of
such subjects cannot come from ratiocination or from [the
-

( Trallslalor's ,/Ole: Literally: 'The Internal Constitution for Itself[fiir siehl' i.e. the internal
aspects will be considered here in their own right.

Philosophy ofRight
consideration of] ends, grounds, and utilities - let alone from
emotionality, love, and enthusiasm - but only from the con­
cept; and it is also to be hoped that those who believe that the
divine is incomprehensible and that cognition of the truth is a
futile

[nichtiges]

enterprise will take no further part in the

discussion. At any rate, neither the undigested chatter nor the
edifYing sentiments which their emotions and enthusiasm
generate can claim to merit the attention of philosophy.
Among ideas [Vorstellungen] now in currency, that of the
necessary division [Teilung] ofpowers within the state calls for

mention (with reference to § 269).2 This is a highly important
determination which, if understood in its true sense, could
rightly be regarded as the guarantee of public freedom; but it

is also an idea

[Vorstellu1zg]

of which those very people who

believe that they speak out of love and enthusiasm know
nothing and wish to know nothing, for it is in this very idea
that the moment of rational

determinacy lies.

In other words,

the principle of the division of powers contains the essential
moment of difference, of real rationality; but such is the view of
the abstract understanding that, on the one hand, it attributes
to this principle the false determination of the

sufficiency of each

absolute self­

power in relation to the others, and on the

other hand, it one-sidedly interprets

[auffassen] the relation of

these powers to one another as negative, as one of mutual

limitation.

In this view, the reaction of each power to the

others is one of hostility and fear, as if to an evil
their determination

[ Ube!], and
[Bestimmung] is such that they oppose one

another and produce, by means of this counterpoise, a general

equilibrium rather than a living unity. It is only the

self­
determination of the concept within itself, not any other ends or

utilities, which contains the absolute origin of the different
powers, and it is solely because of this that the organization of

the state is inherently
reason. - How the

[in sidz] rational and the image of eternal
concept and subsequently, in concrete

fashion, the Idea, become determined in themselves and

thereby posit their moments - universality, particularity, and
individuality

[Einzelheit] - in abstraction can be learned from

logic (though not, of course, from the logic commonly in
use).3 At any rate, to take the negative as a starting-point and

I

I

Ethical Life
to make malevolence and distrust of malevolence the primary
factor, and then, on this assumption, to devise ingenious
defences whose efficiency depends merely on corresponding
counter-defences is, as far as thought is concerned, charac­
teristic of the

negative understanding and, as far as the disposi­

tion is concerned, characteristic of the outlook of the rabble
(see §
the

244 above). - If the powers - e.g. what have been called

executive and legislative powers - attain self-sufficiency,

the

destruction of the state, as has been witnessed on a grand
scale4 [in our times], is immediately posited; or

if the state is

essentially preserved, a unity of one kind or another is
established for the time being by means of a conflict whereby
one power subjugates the others, and it is by
that the essential [object], the survival

this means alone

[Bestehen] of the state, is

achieved.

Addition (H). One should expect nothing from the state except what is an
expression of rationality. The state is the world which the spirit has
created for itself; it therefore follows a determinate course which has
being in and for itself. How often do we hear talk of the wisdom of God in
nature! But we must not for a moment imagine that the physical world of
nature is of a higher order than the world of the spirit; for the state is as
far above physical life as spirit is above nature. We should therefore
venerate the state as an earthly divinity" and rea1i2e that, if it is difficult to
comprehend nature, it is an infinitely more arduous task to understand
the state. It is of the utmost significance that, in recent times, we have
attained specificb intuitions concerning the state in general and have been
so much occupied with discussing and framing constitutions. But this still
does not resolve the problem; it is also necessary to bring to a rational
matter

[Saehe] the reason of intuition,' to know what its essence is, and [to

rea1i2e] that its most conspicuous aspect is not always the essential. Thus,
while the powers of the state must certainly be distinguished, each must
form a whole in itself and contain the other moments within it. When we
speak of the distinct activities of these powers, we must not fall into the
monumental error of taking this to mean that each power should exist
independently

rfiir siehl

and in abstraction; on the contrary, the powers

should be distinguished only as moments of the concept. On the other

hand, if these differences do exist [besfehetl] independently and in abstrac­
tion, it is plain to see that two self-sufficient entities cannot constitute a
unity, but must certainly give rise to a conflict whereby either the whole is
destroyed or unity is restored by force. Thus, during the French Revolu­
tion, the legislative power at times engulfed the so-called executive, and at
other times the executive power engulfed the legislative, so that it remains
an absurdity in this context to raise, for example, the moral demand for
harmony. For if we refer the matter [Sache] to the emotions, we admit­
tedly save ourselves all the trouble; but although ethical feeling may be
necessary, it is not qualified to determine the powers of the state on its
own. Thus, the main point to note is that, just as the determinations of the
powers are in themselves the whole, so too do all of them, in their
existence [Existellz], constitute the entire concept. We usually speak of
three powers - the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. The first of
these corresponds to universality and the second to particularity; but the
judiciary is not the third constituent of the concept, because its [i.e. the
judiciary's] individuality [Eillzelheif] lies outside the above spheres.

The political state is therefore divided into three substantial
elements:l
(a) the power to determine and establish the universal - the legislative
power;
(b) the subsumption of particular spheres and individual cases under
the universal - the executive power,
(c) subjectivity as th e ultimate decision of the will - the power of the
sovereign, in which the different powers are united in an individual
unity which is thus the apex and beginning of the whole, i.e. of

cOllstitutiollal mollarchy.
The development rAusbildtmg] of the state to constitutional
monarchy is the achievement of the modern world, in which
the substantial Idea has attained infinite form. The lzistory of
this immersion of the world spirit in itself or - and this
amounts to the same thing - this free development in which
the Idea releases its moments (and they are only its moments)
from itself as totalities, and in so doing contains them in that
ideal unity of the concept in which real rationality consists

[besteht] - the history of this true fonnation [Gestaltung] of
ethical life is the concern [Sache] of universal world history.
The old classification of constitutions into monarchy,
anstocracy, and democracy presupposes a still undivided and sub­
stantial unity which has not yet attained its inner differentiation
(as an organization developed within itself) and which conse­
quently still lacks depth and concrete rationality.2 From the point
of view of the ancient world, therefore, this classification is the
true and correct one; for in the case of a unity which is still
substantial and has not yet progressed to its absolute develop­
ment [Entfoltung] within itself, the difference is essentially
external and appears primarily as a difference in the number of
those in whom that substantial unity is supposed to be imma­
nent (see Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences, § 52).a
These forms, which in this instance belong to different
wholes, are reduced, in constitutional monarchy, to [the status
of] moments. The monarch is one [individual]; several partici­
pate in the executive power, and the many at large participate
in the legislative power. But as already mentioned, such
purely quantitative differences are merely superficial and do
not convey the concept of the thing [Sache]. There has been
much talk in recent times of the democratic and aristocratic
elements itl mOTlarchy, but this is equally beside the point; for
in so far as the determinations in question do occur in
monarchy, they have lost their democratic and aristocratic
character. - Some representations [Vorstellungen] of constitu­
tions merely set up the state as an abstraction which governs
and issues commands, and leave it undecided - or regard it as
immaterial - whether this state is headed by one or several or
all. - 'All these fonns', says Fichte in his Natural Law (part I,
p. 1 96), 'are right and proper provided that there is an ephor­
ate'4 (an institution devised by Fichte as a counterweight to the
supreme power), 'and may promote and preserve universal
right within the state'. - Such a view (like the device of an
ephorate) is a product of that superficial conception of the
state referred to above. If social conditions are quite simple,
these differences are admittedly of little or no significance;

as

more plausible.

Philosophy ojRight
thus Moses, for example, made no provision in his legislation
for institutional changes in the event of the people requiring a
king, but merely added the commandment that the king
should not possess large quantities of horses, wives, and silver
and gold (Deuteronomy 17: 1 6ff.). - Furthermore, it is
certainly possible in one sense to say that the Idea is likewise
indifferent to the three forms in question (including that of
monarchy, at least in its limited meaning as an alternative to
aristocracy and democracy); but it is indifferent to them in the
opposite sense [to that of Fichte], because all three are out of
keeping with the Idea in its rational development [Entwick­
lung] (see § 272), and the latter could not attain its right and
actuality in any of them. For this reason, it has become utterly
pointless to ask which of the three is most commendable; such
forms can be discussed only in a historical context. - Never­
theless, in this as in so many other instances, we must
acknowledge Montesquieu's depth of insight in his famous
account of the principles of these forms of government. But
while acknowledging the accuracy of his account, we must not
misunderstand it. It is common knowledge that he specified
virtue as the principle of democracy/ and such a constitution
does indeed depend on the disposition [of the citizens] as the
purely substantial form in which the rationality of the will
which has being in and for itself still exists under this con­
stitution. But Montesquieu6 adds that England, in the seven­
teenth century, afforded a fine spectacle of how efforts to
establish a democracy were rendered impotent by a lack of
virtue on the part of the leaders, and further observes that,
when virtue disappears from the republic, ambition takes hold
of those whose hearts [Gemut] are susceptible to it and greed
takes possession of everyone, so that the state falls prey to
universal exploitation and its strength resides solely in the
power of a few individuals and the unruliness of everyone. To
these remarks, it must be replied that, as the condition of
society grows more advanced and the powers of particularity
are developed and liberated, it is not enough for the heads of
state to be virtuous; another form of rational law is required
apart from that of the [individual] disposition if the whole is to
have the strength to maintain its unity and to grant the forces
3 10

T

Ethical Life
of developed particularity their positive as well as negative
rights. In the same way, we must avoid the misunderstanding
of imagining that, since the disposition of virtue is the sub­
stantial form in a democratic republic, this disposition thereby
becomes superfluous, or may even be totally absent, in a
monarchy; and still less should we imagine that virtue and the

legally detennined

activity of an

articulated

organization are

mutually opposed and incompatible. - The view that modera­

tion

is the principle

of

aristoCTac:i

entails an incipient

divergence between public power and private interest, which
at the same time affect each other so directly that this con:..

stitution is intrinsically liable at any moment to turn immedi­

ately into the harshest condition of tyranny or anarchy - as
witness the history of Rome - and so to destroy itself. - The

honour as the principle of
monarc1ly8 is enough to indicate that the monarchy he has in

fact that Montesquieu recognizes

mind is neither the patriarchal or ancient variety nor that
which has developed an objective constitution, but

monarchy

feudal

as that in which the relationships covered by its

constitutional law

[itltlert1l Staatsrecht]

have become firmly

established as rights of private property and privileges of
individuals and corporations. Since the life of the state is
based, under this constitution, on privileged personalities to
whose discretion a large part of what has to be done for the
preservation

[Besteht1l]

of the state is entrusted, the objective

aspect of their services consists not in

tations [Vomellzwg]

and

opinions;

duties but in represt1l­

consequently, the state is

held together not by duty but merely by

honour.

Another question naturally presents itself here:

draw up the constitution?

who is to

This question seems clear enough,

but closer inspection at once shows that it is nonsensical. For
it presupposes that no constitution as yet exists, so that only an
atomistic

aggregate

of individuals is present. How such

an

aggregate could arrive at a constitution, whether by its own
devices or with outside help, through altruism

[Gute], thought,

or force, would have to be left to it to decide, for the concept is
not applicable to an aggregate. - But if the above question
presupposes that a constitution is already present,

to draw up a

constitution can only mean to change it, and the very fact that
3II

Philosophy ojRight
a constitution is presupposed at once implies that this change
could take place only in a constitutional manner. - But it is at
any rate utterly essential that the constitution should not be
regarded as something made, even if it does have an origin in
time. On the contrary, it is quite simply that which has being
in and for itself, and should therefore be regarded as divine
and enduring, and as exalted above the sphere of all manufac­
tured things.9

Additioll (H). The principle of the modern world at large is freedom of
subjectivity, according to which aU essential aspects present in the
spiritual totality develop and enter into their right. If we begin with this
point of view, we can scarcely raise the idle question of which form,
monarchy or democracy, is superior. We can only say that the forms of aUa
political constitutions are one-sided if they cannot sustain within them­
selves the principle of free subjectivity and are unable to conform to fuUy
developed reason.

"Translator's note: In Hotho's notes, on which this Addition is based, this word is not aller
('all') but alter ('ancient'), so that Hegel's observation, which then reads 'the fonns of
ancient political constitutions are one-sided and cannot sustain [etc.]" applies only to the
constitutions of antiquity. Gans has removed the sentence from its context in the notes
and given it a more general application.

Since spirit is actual only as that which it knows itself to be, and since
the state, as the spirit of a nation [Volk] , is both the law which
penlleates all relatiOlls within it and also the customs and consciousness
of the individuals who belong to it, the constitution of a specific nation
will in general depend on the nature and development [BildulIg] of its
self-consciousness; it is in this self-consciousness that its subjective
freedom and hence also the actuality of the constitution lie.
The wish to give a nation a constitution a priori, even if its
content were more or less rational, is an idea [Eillfol� which
overlooks the very moment by virtue of which a constitution is
more than a product of thought. Each nation accordingly has
the constitution appropriate and proper to it.

Additioll (H,G). The constitution of a state must permeate aU relations
within it. Napoleon, for example, tried to give the Spanish a constitution a
312

Ethical Lift

§§ 2 7 3-275

priori, but the consequences were bad enough. For a constitution is not
simply made: it is the work of centuries, the Idea and consciousness of the
rational (in so far as that consciousness has developed in a nation). No
constitution can therefore be created purely subjectively [von Subjekten].
What Napoleon gave to the Spanish was more rational than what they had
before, and yet they rejected it as something alien, because they were not
yet sufficiently cultivated [gebildetV The constitution of a nation must
embody the nation's feeling for its rights and [present] conditionj
otherwise it will have no meaning or value, even if it is present in an
external sense. Admittedly, the need and longing for a better constitution
may often be present in individuals [Eillzelnen], but for the entire mass [of
people] to be filled with such an idea [Vorstelllmg] is quite another matter,
and this does not occur until later. Socrates' principle of morality or
inwardness was a necessary product of his age, but it took time for this to
become [part of] the universal self-consciousness.

a. The Power of the Sovereign

The power of the sovereign itself contains the three moments of the
totality within itself (see § 272), namely the universality of the con­
stitution and laws, J consultation as the reference of the partiCltlar to
the universal, and the moment of ultimate decision as the self­
detentlination to which everything else reverts and from which its
actuality originates. This absolute self-determination constitutes the
distinguishing principle of the power of the sovereign as such, and
will accordingly be dealt with first.

Addition (H). We begin with the power of the sovereign, i.e. with the
moment of individuality [Ei/zze/heit], for it contains within itself the three
moments of the state as a totality. In other words, the 'I' is simultaneously
the most individual" and the most universal [element]. On the face of it,
nature, too, is individual in character, but reality - i.e. non-ideality or
mutual externality - is not that which has being with itself [das Beisicll­
seiende]j for in reality, the various individual units [Einzelheiten] subsist
side by side. In the spirit, on the other hand, all the various elements are
present only ideally and as a unity. Thus, the state, as spiritual in charac­
ter, is the exposition of all its moments, but individuality b is at the same

time its inner soul and animating principle, [and this takes the form of]
sovereignty, which contains all differences within itself.

I . The basic determination of the political state is the substantial
unity or ideality ofits moments. (a) In this unity, the particular powers
and functions of the state are both dissolved and preserved. But they
are preserved only in the sense that they are justified not as
independent entities, but only in such a way and to such an extent as
is determined by the Idea of the whole; their source is the latter's
authority [Macht] and they are its fluid members, just as it is their
simple self.

Addition (G). This ideality of the moments [in the state] is like life in an

organic body: it is present at every point, there is only one life in all of
them, and there is no resistance to it. Separated from it, each point must
die. The same applies to the ideality of all the individual estates, powers,
and corporations, however much their impulse may be to subsist and have
being for themselves. In this respect, they resemble the stomach of an
organism which also posits itself as independent ffiir sidz] but is at the
same time superseded and sacrificed and passes over into the whole. J

«(3) The particular functions and activities of the state belong to it as its
own essential moments, and the individuals who perform and
implement them are associated with them not by virtue of their
immediate personalities, but only by virtue of their universal and
objective qualities. Consequently, the link between these functions
and particular personalities as such is external and contingent in
character. For this reason, the functions and powers of the state
cannot be private property. J

Additiolz (G). The activity of the state is associated with individuals. The
latter, however, are not entitled by nature to perform these tasks, but
[only] by virtue of their objective qualities. Ability, skill, and character are
partimlar qualities of an individual, who must be trained and educated for
a particular occupation. For this reason, an office can neither be sold nor
inherited. In France, seats in parliament were formerly sold, as are offi­
cers' commissions up to a certain rank in the English army to this day; but

sovereignty (see below). - In the

feudal mOllarchy

extemal

of earlier

times, the state certainly had external sovereignty, but inter­
nally, neither the monarch himself nor the state was
sovereign. On the one hand (cf. Remarks to § 273), the par­
ticular functions and powers of the state and civil society were
vested in independent corporations and communities, so that
the whole was more of an aggregate than an organism; and on
the other hand, they [i.e. these functions and powers] were the
private property of individuals, so that what the latter had to
do in relation to the whole was left to their own opinion and
discretion. - The

idealism which constitutes sovereignty is the

same determination as that according to which the so-called

parts

of an animal organism are not parts, but members or

organic moments whose isolation and separate existence [Fiir­

siclz-Bestehen] constitute disease (see Ellcyclopaedia of the
Philosophical Sciences, § 293). 1 It is the same principle which
we encountered (see § 7) in the abstract concept of the will
(see Remarks to § 279) as self-referring negativity, and hence
as universality

in

which all particularity and determinacy are superseded - i.e.
the absolute and self-determining ground. In order to grasp
this, one must first have understood the whole conception of
the substance and true subjectivity of the concept. - Since
sovereignty is the ideality of every particular authority
315

[Bereclz-

Philosophy ofRight
tigrmg], it is easy to fall into the very common misunderstand­
ing of regarding this ideality as mere power and empty
arbitrariness, and of equating sovereignty with despotism. But
despotism signifies the condition of lawlessness in general, in
which the particular will as such, whether of a monarch or of
the people (ochlocracy), counts as law (or rather replaces law),
whereas sovereignty is to be found specifically under lawful
and constitutional conditions as the moment of ideality of the
particular spheres and functions [within the state]. In other
words, these spheres are not independent or self-sufficient in
their ends and modes of operation, nor are they solely
.immersed in themselves; on the contrary, in these same ends
and modes of operation, they are determined by and
dependent on the end oftire whole (to which the indeterminate
expression 'the welfore of the state' has in general been
applied). This ideality manifests itself in two different ways. In times of peace, the particular spheres and functions [within
the state] pursue the course of satisfYing themselves and their
ends, and it is in part only as a result of the unconscious
necessity of the thing [Sache] that their selfishness is transfimned
into a contribution to mutual preservation, and to the
preservation of the whole (see § 1 83). But it is also in part a
direa influence from above which constantly brings them back
to the end of the whole and limits them accordingly (see 'The
Executive Power', § 289), and at the same time urges them to
perfonn direct services for the preservation of the whole. But in a situatiotl ofcrisis [Not] - whether in internal or external
affairs - it is around the simple concept of sovereignty that the
organism and all the particular spheres of which it fonnerly
consisted rally, and it is to this sovereignty that the salvation of
the state is entrusted, while previously legitimate functions
[dieses sons! Bereclltigte] are sacrificed; and this is where that
idealism already referred to attains its distinct actuality (see
§ 3 2 1 below).

2. Sovereignty, which is initially only the universal thought of this
ideality, can exist only as subjeaivity which is certain of itself, and as

the will's abstract - and to that extent ungrounded - self-deten11inati071
in which the ultimate decision is vested. This is the individual aspect
of the state as such, and it is in this respect alone that the state itself is
one. But subjectivity attains its truth only as a mbjea, and personality
only as a person, and in a constitution which has progressed to real
rationality, each of the three moments of the concept has its distinc­
tive [ausgesonderte] shape which is aaual for itself. This absolutely
decisive moment of the whole, therefore, is not individuality in
general, but one individual, the monarch.
The immanent development of a science, the derivation of its
entire content from the simple concept - and without such a
derivation it certainly does not deserve the name of a
philosophical science - has the following distinctive feature.
One and the same concept - in this case the will - which
begins by being abstract (because it is itself the beginning),
retains its character yet [at the same time] consolidates its
determinations, again through its own exclusive agency, and
thereby acquires a concrete content. Thus, it is the basic
moment of personality, initially abstract in [the sphere of]
immediate right, which has continued to develop through its
various forms of subjectivity until at this point, in [the sphere
of] absolute right, in the state, and in the completely concrete
objectivity of the will, it becomes the personality ofthe state, its
certainty ofitself. This last [instance], whose simple self super­
sedes all particularities, cuts short the weighing of arguments
[Griblde] and counter-arguments (between which vacillations
in either direction are always possible) and resolves them by its
'I will' , thereby initiating all activity and actuality. - But per­
sonality (and subjectivity in general), as infinite and self-refer­
ring, has its truth - and indeed its proximate and immediate
truth - simply and solely as a person, i.e. as a subject which
has being for itself; and that which has being for itself is also
simply one. The personality of the state has actuality only as a
person, as the monarch. - Personality expresses the concept as
such, whereas the person also embodies the actuality of the
concept, and only when it is determined in this way [i.e. as a
person] is the concept Idea or truth. - A so-called moralperson,
[such as] a society, community, or family, however concrete it

Philosophy ojRight
may be in itself, contains personality only abstractly as one of
its moments. In such a person, personality has not yet reached
the truth of its existence [Existe11z]. The state, however, is
precisely this totality in which the moments of the concept
attain actuality in accordance with their distinctive truth. - All
these determinations, both in themselves [fiir siehl and in the
[particular] shapes which they assume, have been discussed
throughout this entire treatise; but they are repeated here
because, although they are readily accepted when they assume
a particular shape, they are no longer recognized and appre­
hended precisely when they reappear in their true position,
i.e. no longer in isolation, but in their truth as mome11ts of the
Idea. - The concept of the monarch is therefore extremely
difficult for ratiocination - i.e. the reflective approach of the
understanding - to grasp, because such ratiocination stops
short at isolated determinations, and consequently knows only
[individual] reasons [Griillde] , finite viewpoints, and deductioll
from such reasons. It accordingly presents the dignity of the
monarch as derivative, not only in its form but also in its
determination, whereas the very concept of monarchy is that it
is not deduced from something else but e11tirely self-origillatillg.
The idea [Vo1:Stellullg] that the right of the monarch is based
on divine authority is therefore the closest approximation to
this concept, because it conveys the unconditional aspect of
the right in question. But the misunderstandings associated
with this idea are familiar enough, and the task of philosophi­
cal enquiry consists precisely in comprehending this divine
quality.
The term 'popular sovereigllfy' may be used to indicate that a
people is self-sufficient for all external purposes and con­
stitutes a state of its own, like the people of Great Britain - as
distinct from the peoples of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or
of Venice, Genoa, Ceylon, etc., who are now no longer
sovereign because they have ceased to have sovereign princes
or supreme governments of their own. - We may also say that
illtenlal sovereigllfY lies with the people, but only if we are speak­
ing of the whole [state] in general, in keeping with the above
demonstration (see § § 277 and 278) that sovereignty belongs
to the state. But the usual sense in which the term 'popular

Ethical Life
sovereignty' has begun to be used in recent times is to denote

the vpposite ofthat sovereiglIty which exists in the mOllarch. In this
oppositional sense, popular sovereignty is one of those con­
fused thoughts which are based on a garbled notion [Vomel­
lung] of the people. Without its monarch and that articulation of
the whole which is necessarily and immediately associated
with monarchy, the people is a formless mass. The latter is no
longer a state, and none of those determinations which are
encountered only in an i1lfemally organized whole (such as
sovereignty, government, courts of law, public authorities
[Obrigkeit], estates, etc.) is applicable to it. It is only when
moments such as these which refer to an organization, to
political life, emerge in a people that it ceases to be that
indeterminate abstraction which the purely general idea
[Vorstellung] of the people denotes. - If 'popular sovereignty' is
taken to mean a republican form [of government], or more
specifically democracy (for the term 'republic' covers many
other empirical combinations which are in any case irrelevant
in a philosophical discussion), then all that needs to be said
has already been said above (see Remarks to § 273), apart
from which there can be no further discussion of such a
notion [Vorstellutlg] in face of the developed Idea. - If a people
is represented neither as a patriarchal tribe [Stamm], nor as
existing in an undeveloped condition in which democratic or
aristocratic forms are possible (see Remarks to § 273) - or
indeed in any other arbitrary and inorganic condition - but is
envisaged as an internally developed and truly organic totality,
its sovereignty will consist in the personality of the whole,
which will in turn consist in the reality appropriate to its
concept, i.e. the person of the mOllarch.
At that stage referred to above at which constitutions were
divided into democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy - i.e. the
point of view of substantial unity which remains \vithin itself
and which has not yet attained its infinite differentiation and
immersion in itself - the moment of the ultimate and self­
detemlillillg decisioll of the will does not emerge for itself in its
OWll distinti aauality as an immallent organic moment of the
state. Admittedly, even when the state assumes these less
advanced shapes, there must always be an individual at its

Philosophy ofRight
head. This individual is either already present as such [fUr
sich], as in monarchies of the type in question, or, as in
aristocracies and more particularly in democracies, he may
rise up from among the statesmen or generals in a contingent
manner and as particular circumstances require; for all actions
and all actuality are initiated and implemented by a leader as
the decisive unit. But enclosed in a union of powers which is
still undifferentiated, this subjectivity of decision must either
be contingent in its origin and emergence or occupy an alto­
gether subordinate position. So long as heads of state were
subject to such conditions, it was only in a sphere beyond their
own that a pure and unalloyed decision could be found in the
shape of a fate which determined [events] from without. As a
moment within the Idea, this decision had to come into
existence [Existenz], but its roots lay outside the circle of
human freedom which the state encompasses. - This is the
origin of the need to derive the ultimate decision on major
issues and important concerns [Momente] of the state from
oracles, a daemon (in the case of Socrates), the entrails of
animals, the feeding and flight of birds, etc.;! for when human
beings had not yet fathomed the depths of self-consciousness
or emerged from the undifferentiated condition of substantial
unity to attain being for themselves, they were not yet strong
enough to perceive this decision within their own being. - In
the daen/On of Socrates (cf. [Remarks to] § 1 3 8 above), we can
see how the will which in the past had simply projected itself
beyond itself began to tum in upon itself and to recognize itself
from within, which is the beginning of a self-Imowing and
hence genuine freedom. Since this real freedom of the Idea
consists precisely in giving each of the moments of rationality
its own present and self-conscious actuality, it is through its
agency that the ultimate self-determining certainty which
constitutes the apex of the concept of the will is allotted the
function of a[n individual] consciousness. But this ultimate
self-determination can fall within the sphere of human
freedom only in so far as it occupies this supreme position,
isolatedfor itselfand exalted abflVe evel)'thing particular and con­
ditional; for only thus does its actuality accord with its concept.

(G). In the organization of the state (which in this case means
constitutional monarchy), the one thing which we must bear in mind is
the internal necessity of the Idea; all other considerations are irrelevant.
The state must be regarded as a great architectonic edifice, a hieroglyph
of reason which becomes manifest in actuality. All considerations of mere
utility, externality, and the like must therefore be excluded from a
philosophical treatment [of this subject]. Representational thought can
easily comprehend that the state is the self-determining and completely
sovereign will, the ultimate source of decisions. But it is more difficult to
grasp this 'I will' as a person, for this [formula] does not imply that the
monarch may act arbitrarily: on the contrary, he is bound by the concrete
content of the advice he receives, and if the constitution is firmly
established, he often has nothing more to do than to sign his name. But
this name is important: it is the ultimate instance and nOll plus ultra. It
could be said that an organic articulation was already present in the
beautiful democracy of Athens, but we can see at once that the Greeks
based the ultimate decision on completely external phenomena [Er­
scheinunge1l] such as oracles, the entrails of sacrificial animals, and the
flight of birds, and that they regarded nature as a power which proclaimed
and expressed by these means what was good for human beings. At that
time, self-consciousness had not yet arrived at the abstraction of subjec­
tivity, nor had it yet realized that an 'I will' must be pronounced by man
himself on the issue to be decided. This 'I will' constitutes the great
difference between ancient and modern worlds, so that it must have its
own distinct existence [EXiste1lz] in the great edifice of the state.
Unfortunately, however, this determination is regarded" as merely
external and discretionary.

3 . Seen in abstraction, this ultimate self of the will of the state is
simple and therefore an immediate individuality [Einzelheit], so that the
determination of naturalness is inherent in its very concept. The
monarch, therefore, is essentially determined as this individual, in
abstraction from every other content, and this individual is destined
[bestimmt] in an immediate and natural way, i.e. by his natural birth, to
hold the dignity of the monarch.
This transition from the concept of pure self-determination to

32 1

Philosophy ofRight
the immediacy of being, and hence to the natural realm, is of a
purely speculative nature, and its cognition accordingly
belongs to logical philosophy. Furthermore, it is, on the
whole, the same transition as that which is already familiar to
us from the nature of the will in general, as the process which
translates a content from subjectivity (as an end in view

vorgestellten Zweck])

[als

into existence [Daseil1] (see § 8). But the

distinctive form of the Idea and of the transition here in
question is the

immediate tral1sjOnnatiotl

of the pure self­

determination of the will (Le. of the simple concept itself) into

this [specific entity], into natural existence, without the medi­
ation of a particular content (such as the end of an action). - In
the so-called

o1/tological proof of the existence of God, it is this

same transformation of the absolute concept into being which
has given the Idea its profundity in the modern age. But this
has recendy been declared

il1comprehensible, which amounts to
tmth, for truth is simply the

renouncing all cognition of the

unity of the concept and existence (see § 23). 1 Since this unity
is not to be found in the consciousness of the understanding,
which continues to regard these two moments of the truth as

separate, this consciousness may perhaps, in the present [reli­
gious] context, concede the possibility of a faith in this unity.
But since the idea [Vorstelltmg] of the monarch is regarded as
entirely within the scope of ordinary consciousness, the
understanding insists all the more firmly on its separation [of
the two moments] and on the consequences which its astute
reasoning can deduce from this. It accordingly denies that the
moment of ultimate decision in the state is linked

itself (i.e.

il1 and for

in the concept of reason) with the immediate and

natural, and concludes from this first, that this link is

til1gent,

COl1-

and secondly - since it equates rationality with the

absolute distinctness of the two moments - that such a link is

irrational. From this, further devastating consequences ensue
for the Idea of the state.

Additi01I (H). A frequent objection to monarchy is that it makes the affairs
of the state subject to contingency
since the monarch may be ill­
educated or unworthy of holding the highest office - and that it is absurd
for such a situation to be regarded as rational. But this objection is based
on the invalid assumption that the monarch's particular character is of

322

Ethical Life

§§ 280-28r

vital importance. I n a fully organized state, it is only a question o f the
highest instance of formal decision, and all that is required in a monarch
is someone to say 'yes' and to dot the 'i'; for the supreme office should be
such that the particular character of its occupant

is

of no significance.

Whatever other qualities the monarch has in addition to his role of
ultimate decision belong to [the sphere of] particularity

[Partikularitiit] '

which must not be allowed to affect the issue. There may indeed be
circumstances in which this particularity plays an exclusive part, but in
that case the state is either not yet fully developed, or it is poorly construc­
ted. In a well-ordered monarchy, the objective aspect is solely the concern
of the law, to which the monarch merely has to add his subjective 'I will'.2

§ 281
The two moments in their undivided unity
ungrounded self of the will, and its existence

i.e. the ultimate

[Existe1Jz]

which is

consequendy also ungrounded (and which belongs by definition

[Bestimmlmg] to nature) - constitute the Idea of something Imm(JVed by
majesty of the monarch. In this unity lies the
aaual unity of the state, and it is only by virtue of its inward and
outward immediacy that this unity is saved from being dragged down
into the sphere of particularity with its arbitrariness, ends, and
arbitrary will, i.e. the

attitudes, from the strife of factions round the throne, and from the
enervation and destruction of the power of the state.
The rights of birth and inheritance constitute the basis

[Grund]

of legitimacy, i.e. the basis not just of a purely positive

right but also [of a right contained] in the Idea. - If the mode
of succession is clearly defined - i.e. if the throne is inherited
- the formation of factions is prevented when the throne falls
vacant; this circumstance has long been cited, and righdy so,
in support of hereditary succession. Nevertheless, this aspect
is merely a consequence, and if it is made into a

[Gnmd],

ground

it debases [the monarch's] majesty to the sphere of

ratiocination and, regardless of its character of ungrounded
inunediacy and ultimate inward being, grounds it not upon the
Idea of the state which is inunanent within it, but on some­
thing outside it, on some thought of a different character such
as the welfare

ofthe state or ofthe people. From a determination

of this kind, it is indeed possible, by using middle terms

3 23

Philosophy ofRight
[medios temlillos],

to deduce [the need for] hereditary suc­

cession; but other middle terms, and hence other conse­
quences, are equally possible, and the consequences which
have been drawn from this we/fore of the people (salut du
peuple) are only too familiar. - For these reasons, philosophy
alolle is in a position to consider this majesty [of the monarch]
by means of thought, for every method of enquiry other than
the speculative method of the infinite and self-grounded Idea
annuls [atif'lebt] the nature of majesty in and for itself. Elective mOtlarc/li may well seem the most llatural idea [Vor­
stelltmg], i.e. the one most obvious to superficial thinking; for
since it is the concerns and interests of the people that the
monarch must look after, it can be argued that the people
must also be left to choose whom they wish to entrust their
welfare to, and that it is from this trust alone that the right to
rule arises. This view, like the ideas

[Vorstelltmge1l]

of the

monarch as the first servant of the state/ of a contractual
relationship between monarch and people, etc., bases itself on
the will in the sense of the caprice, opinion, and arbitrariness of

the matlY - a

determination which, as we noticed some time

ago,a3 is of primary importance in civil society (or merely seeks

to assert itself as such), but is not the [basic] principle of the
family, let alone of the state, and is completely opposed to the
Idea of ethical life. - Indeed, it is even possible for ratiocina­
tion to deduce from the

cOllseqUe1lces of elective monarchy that

it is the worst of institutions. But these consequences appear
to ratiocination only as a possibility or probability, although they
are in fact an essential concomitant of this institution. That is
to say, the nature of the situation in an elective monarchy
whereby the

partiClllar

will is made the ultimate source of

electoral
COlltract [Wahlkapitulatioll], i.e. a surrender of the power of the
state at the discretion of the particular [partikulare1l] will; as a
result, the particular [besolldere1l] powers of the state are
decisions means that the constitution becomes an

turned into private property, the sovereignty of the state is

weakened and lost, and the state is dissolved from within and
destroyed from without.4

§§ 28I -282

Addition (G). In order to grasp the Idea ofthe monarch, it is not enough to

say that kings are appointed by God, for God has made everything,
including the worst [of things].5 The point of view of utility does not get
us far either, for it is always possible to point to disadvantages. And it is of
just as little help to regard monarchy as a positive right. The fact that I
have property is necessary, but this [or that] particular possession is
contingent, and the right whereby one individual must occupy the highest
office appears in a similar light if it is taken in an abstract and positive
sense. But this right is present as a felt need and as a need of the thing
[Sache] in and for itself. Monarchs are not exactly distinguished by their
physical powers or intellect [Geist], yet millions accept them as their
rulers. But it is absurd to say that people allow themselves to be ruled in
defiance of their own interests, ends, and intentions, for they are not as
stupid as that; it is their need, the inner power of the Idea, which compels
them to accept such rule and keeps them in this situation, even if they
appear to be consciously opposed to it. Thus, whereas the monarch
functions as head of state and as part of the constitution, it has to be said
that a conquered people is not constitutionally identical with its sovereign.
If a rebellion occurs in a province conquered in war, this is not the same
thing as a revolt in a well-organized state. The conquered people are not
rebelling against their sovereign prince, and they are not committing a
political crime, for they are not linked ,vith their master in terms of the
Idea or through the inner necessity of the constitution. There is only a
contract, but not a political association. 'Je ne suis pas votre prince, je suis
votre maitre'" was Napoleon's reply to the delegates at Erfurt.6
"Translator's note: '1 am not your prince, I am your master.'

§ 282
The sovereignty of the monarch is the source of the right to pardon
criminals, for only the sovereign is entitled to actualize the power of
the spirit to undo what has been done and to nullifY crime by forgiving
and forgetting.
The right of pardon is one of the highest acknowledgements
of the majesty of the spirit. - Furthermore, this right is one of
those instances in which a determination from a higher sphere
is applied to, or reflected in, a lower one. - But such appli­
cations are the concern of particular science, which must deal
with the entire empirical range of its subject (cf. [the first]

32 5

Philosophy ojRight
footnote to the Remarks to § 270). - Another example of such
applications is the subsumption under the concept of crime
(which we encountered in an earlier context - see § § 95-1 02)
of injuries [Verletzungen] to the state in general, or to the
sovereignty, majesty, and personality of the sovereign prince;
such injuries are in fact classed as crimes of the highest order,
and a particular procedure etc. [is applied to them] .

Addition (H).

Pardon is the remission of punishment, but it is not a
cancellation of right [die aber das Recht nicht aujhebt]. On the contrary,
right continues to apply, and the pardoned individual still remains a
criminal; the pardon does not state that he has not committed a crime.
This cancellation {Aujhebtmg] of punishment may be effected by religion,
for what has been done can be undone in spirit by spirit itself.! But in so
far as it is accomplished in this world, it is to be found only in the majesty
[of the sovereign] and is the prerogative of [the sovereign's] ungrounded
decision.

The second moment contained in the power of the sovereign is that of
particularity or of determinate content and its subsumption under the
Universal. In so far as this moment attains a particular existence
[Existenz], it does so in the highest advisory offices and in the
individuals who hold them; these individuals submit to the monarch
for his decision the content of current affairs of state, or the legal
determinations made necessary by present needs, along with their
objective aspects, grounds for decision, relevant laws, circumstances,
etc. The appointment of individuals for this purpose and their dismis­
sal from office fall within the [competence of the] unrestricted arbi­
trary will of the monarch, since the individuals in question are in
immediate personal contact with him.!

The only factors for which people can be made aCCOU1ltable - i.e. those
which are capable of objective proof and on which advice distinct
from the personal will of the monarch as such can appropriately be
sought - are the objective aspects of decision such as knowledge
[Kenntnis] of the content and circumstances, and the legal and other

Ethical Life

§§ 2 8 2-286

grounds for determination. It is only for matters such as these that the
advisory offices and their incumbents can be held accountable.I But
the distinctive majesty of the monarch, as the ultimate subjectivity of
decision, is raised above all accountability for the acts of government.

The third moment in the power of the sovereign concerns the univer­
sal in and for itself, which is present subjectively in the conscience of
the monarch and objectively in the constitution and laws as a whole. To
this extent, the power of the sovereign presupposes the other
moments, just as it is presupposed by each of them.

The objective guara1ltee of the power of the sovereign and of rightful
succession to the throne by way of inheritance, etc., lies in the fact
that, just as this sphere has its own actuality distinct from that of other
rationally determined moments, so also do these other moments have
their own distinct rights and duties in accordance with their
determination. Each member [of the whole], in maintaining itself
independently [fiir sidl] , thereby also maintains the others in their own
distinct character within the rational organism.
One of the more recent achievements of history has been to
develop the monarchic constitution to the point where heredi­
tary succession to the throne is firmly based on primogeniture.
Monarchy has thereby reverted to the patriarchal principle in
which it had its historical origin, although it now has the
higher determination whereby the monarch is the absolute
apex of an organically developed state. This achievement is of
the greatest importance for public freedom and for a rational
constitution, although it is often very poorly understood - as
we earlier noticed - even if it is treated with respect. Thus, the
history of despotisms and of the purely feudal monarchies of
earlier times represents a succession of rebellions, acts of
violence by rulers, civil wars, the downfall of sovereign princes
and dynasties, and in consequence, general devastation and
destruction on both internal and external fronts. The reason

Philosophy ofRight
for this is that, in conditions such as these, the division

[Teiltmg]

of political business is purely mechanical, with its

different parts distributed among vassals, pashas, etc., so that
the difference [between these elements] is not one of
determination and form, but merely of greater or lesser
power. Thus, each part maintains

itselfa/one, and in so doing,

it promotes only itself and not the others along with it, and has
within itself the complete set of moments which it requires for
independence and self-sufficiency. In an organic relationship,
the units in question are not parts but members, and each

its OW11 function; the sub­
other
maintaining itself. Such

stantial end and product of each is to maintain the

simultaneously

guarantees as are required, whether for the continuity of the

succession and of the power of the sovereign in general, or for
justice, public freedom, etc., are secured by means of institu­
tions. Such factors as the love of the people, character, oaths,
coercion, etc. may be regarded as subjective guarantees; but
when we are dealing with the constitution, we are concerned
solely with objective guarantees or institutions, i.e. ,vith organi­
cally linked and mutually conditioning moments. Thus, public

freedom in general and a hereditary succession guarantee
each other reciprocally, and their association

[Zusammenhang]

is absolute, because public freedom is the rational constitu­
tion, and the hereditary character of the power of the
sovereign is, as has already been shown, the moment inherent
in its concept.

b. The Executive Power

The execution and application of the sovereign's decisions, and in
general the continued implementation and upholding of earlier deci­
sions, existing laws, institutions, and arrangements to promote com­
mon ends, etc., are distinct from the decisions themselves. This task
of subsumption in general belongs to the

executive power, which also

Ethical Life
immediate reference to the particular affairs of civil society, and they
assert the universal interest within these [particular] ends.

§ 288
The particular common interests which fall within civil society, and
which lie outside the universal interest of the state as the interest
which has being in and for itself (see § 256), are administered by the
corporations (see § 25 I) which represent the communities and the
various profeSSions [Gewerbe] and estates, with their authorities
[Obrigkeit], supervisors, administrators, etc. On the one hand, the
business of these administrators is to look after the private property and
illterests of these particular spheres, and in this respect, their authority
[Autoritlit] is based in part on the trust of their fellow-citizens and
equals. On the other hand, these circles must be subordinated to the
higher interests of the state. Thus, the filling of such offices will in
general involve a mixture of popular election by the interested parties,
and confirmation and determination by a higher authority.!

The task of upholding, within these particular rights, legality and the
u1liversal illteres/ of the state, and that of bringing these rights back to
the universal, need to be performed by delegates of the executive
power, i.e. the executive civil seroa1lts and the higher consultative
bodies. The latter necessarily work together in groups, and they
converge in their supreme heads who are in touch with the monarch
himself.!
Just as civil society is the field of conflict in which the private
interest of each individual comes up against that of everyone
else/ so do we here encounter the conflict between private
interests and particular concerns of the community, and
between both of these together and the higher viewpoints and
ordinances of the state. The spirit of the corporation, which
arises when the particular spheres gain legal recognition
[Berechtigtl1lg], is now at the same time inwardly transformed
into the spirit of the state, because it finds in the state the
means of sustaining its particular ends. This is the secret of
the patriotism of the citizens in the sense that they know the

1 -

_

T
Philosophy ofRight
state as their substance, for it is the state which supports their
particular spheres and the legal recognition, authority, and
welfare of these. In so far as the rooting ojthe particular in the
universal is contained immediately in the spirit of the corpora­
tion, it is in this spirit that such depth and strength of disposi­
tion as the state possesses are to be found.
The administration of a corporation's affairs by its own
supervisors will often be inept, for although they know [km­
nm] and have before them their own distinct interests and
affairs, they have a less complete grasp of the connection
between these and more remote conditions and universal
points of view. Besides, further circumstances have a similar
effect, e.g. the close personal contact and other kinds of
equality between the supervisors and those who should be
subordinate to them, the various ways in which they are
dependent on others, etc. But this personal [eigme] sphere
may be seen as belonging to the moment offlrolal freeMm,
which provides an arena in which personal cognition and
personal decisions and their execution, as well as petty pas­
sions and imaginings, may indulge themselves. This is all the
more acceptable in proportion to the triviality of the business
which is thereby vitiated or conducted less efficiently, more
laboriously, etc., and to its relative unimportance for the more
general concerns of the state; and the same applies the more
directly the laborious or foolish conduct of such trifling busi­
ness is related to the satisfaction and self-esteem [Mei1ll11lgvon
sich] which are derived from it.

§ 29 0
division [Teilung] oj labour (see

The
§ 1 98) likewise makes its
appearance in the business of the executive. The organization of offi­
cial bodies accordingly faces the formal but difficult task of ensuring
that civil life shall be governed in a concrete manner from below, where
it is concrete, but that the business in question shall be divided into its
abstraa branches and dealt with by distinct bodies; the latter should
function as separate centres whose activities should again converge
both at the lowest level and in a concrete overview on the part of the
supreme executive. J

Ethical Lift

§ § 289-290

Additi01l (G). The most important issue for the executive power is the
division of functions. The executive power is concerned ,vith the transi­
tion from the universal to the particular and individual, and its functions
must be divided in accordance ,vith its different branches. The difficulty,
however, is [that of ensuring] that they also come together again at upper
and lower levels. For although the power of the police and that of the
judiciary, for example, are divergent, they do converge in every particular
case [Gesclliifi]. The expedient which is often employed in these circum­
stances is to appoint a State Chancellor, Prime Minister, or Cabinet
Council in order to simplifY the highest level of government. But this may
have the result that everything is again controlled from above by
ministerial power, and that functions are, to use the common expression,
centralized.2 This is associated with a high degree of facility, speed, and
effectiveness in measures adopted for the universal interest of the state. A
regime of this kind was introduced by the French Revolution and further
developed by Napoleon, and it still exists [bestellt] in France today. On the
other hand, France lacks corporations and communal associations [Ko11l11Itl1le1l] - that is, circles in which particular and universal interests come
together. Admittedly, these circles gained too great a degree of self­
sufficiency in the Middle Ages, when they became states within the state
and behaved in an obdurate manner like independently established
bodies." But although this ought not to happen, it can still be argued that
the proper strength of states resides in their [internal] communities
[Gemei1ldetl]. In these, the executive encounters legitimate [bereclztigte]
interests which it must respect; and since the administration can only
encourage such interests - although it must also supervise them - the
individual finds protection for the exercise of his rights, so that his par­
ticular [partiklllares] interest is bound up with the preservation of the
whole. For some time now, organization has always been directed from
above, and efforts have been devoted for the most part to this kind of
organization, despite the fact that the lower level of the masses as a whole
can easily be left in a more or less disorganized state. Yet it is extremely
important that the masses should be organized, because only then do they
constitute a power or force; otherwise, they are merely an aggregate, a
collection of scattered atoms. Legitimate power is to be found only when
the particular spheres are organized.

"Translator's note: Gans's version, as translated by the nine preceding words, reads

T
Philosophy ojRight
§ 29 1
The functions of the executive are objective in character; as such [liir
sich], they have already been substantially decided in advance (see
§ 287), and they must be fulfilled and actualized by i1ldividuals.
Individuals are not destined by birth or personal nature to hold a
particular office, for there is no immediate and natural link between
the two. The objective moment in their vocation [Bestimmu1lg] is
knowledge [Erke1l1zt1lis] and proof of ability; this proof guarantees that
the needs of the state will be met, and, as the sole condition [of
appointment], at the same time guarantees every citizen the possibility
of joining the universal estate'!

§ 29 2
There is necessarily an irzdetemlirzate number of candidates for public
office, because their objective qualification does not consist in genius
(as it does in art, for example), and their relative merits cannot be
determined with absolute certainty. The selection of this particular
individual for a given post, his appointment, and his authorization to
conduct public business are subjective decisions, in that they link
together an individual and an office as two factors whose mutual
relation must always be contingent. This subjective aspect pertains to
the sovereign as the supreme [souverii1le1z] and decisive power within
the state.

The particular tasks within the state which the monarch assigns to the
official bodies form part of the objective aspect of sovereignty which is
inherent in him. The specific diJforetzces between these tasks are like­
,vise given in the nature of the thing [Sache]; and just as the activity of
the official bodies is the fulfilment of a duty, so also does their
business constitute a right which is exempt from contingency.

The individual who has been appointed to his professional office by
an act of the sovereign (see § 292) must fulfil his duties, which are the
33 2

1

Ethical Life
substantial aspect of his position [Verhalt1lis], as a condition of his
appointment. As a COllsequetlce of this substantial position, his appoint­
ment provides him with resources, guarantees the satisfaction of his
particularity (see § 264), and frees his external situation and official
activity from other kinds of subjective dependence and influence. I
The state does not count on arbitrary and discretionary servi­
ces (for example, the administration of justice by knights
errant), precisely because such services are discretionary and
arbitrary, and because those who perform them reserve the
right to do so in accordance with their subjective views, or not
to perform them at all if they so wish and to pursue subjective
ends instead. As regards the service of the state, the opposite
extreme to the knight errant would be a civil Seruatlt who
performed his work purely out of necessity [Not] without any
genuine duty and likewise without any right. - In fact, the
service of the state requires those who perform it to sacrifice
the independent and discretionary satisfaction of their subjec­
tive ends, and thereby gives them the right to find their
satisfaction in the performance of their duties, and in this
alone. It is here that, in the present context, that link is to be
found between universal and particular interests which con­
stitutes the concept of the state and its internal stability (see
§ 260). - Similarly, the [civil servant's] relationship to his
office is not one of co1ltract (see § 7 5), although the parties in
question both give their consent and render a service. The
civil servant is not employed, like an agent, to perform a single
contingent task, but makes this relationship [to his work] the
main interest of his spiritual and particular existence
[Existellz]. Likewise, the task which he has to perform and
with which he is entrusted is not a purely particular thing
[Sac/ze] of an external character; the value of such a thing is an
inward quality which is therefore distinct from its external
nature, so that it is not impaired [verletzt] if what has been
stipulated is not delivered (see § 77). But the task which the
civil servant has to perform is, in its inunediate character, a
value in and for itself. The wrong which is done by non­
performance or positive infringement (i.e. by an action in
violation of one's duty, which applies in both of these cases) is
333

§§

291-294

Philosophy ofRight
therefore an infringement of the universal content itself, i.e. a
negatively infinite judgement (cf. § 95), and hence a mis­
demeanour or even a crime. - The guaranteed satisfaction of
particular needs removes that external necessity

[Not]

which

may induce someone to seek the means of satisfYing them at
the expense of his official activities and duty. Those who are
entrusted with the business of the state find protection in its
universal power against another subjective factor, namely the
private passions of the governed, whose private interests etc.
are prejudiced when the universal is asserted against them.

§ 29 5
The protection of the state and the governed against the misuse of
power on the part of the official bodies and their members is, on the
one hand, the direct responsibility

[Verantwortlichkeit]

of their own

hierarchy; on the other hand, it lies with the legal recognition

tigung]

[Bereclz­

accorded to communities and corporations, for this prevents

subjective arbitrariness from interfering on its own account

rfiir sich]

with the power entrusted to officials, and supplements from below
that control from above which does not extend as far as individual
conduct.
The conduct and education of the officials is the point at
which the laws and decisions of the executive come into con­
tact with individuals

[die Einzelheit]

and are translated into

actuality. This is accordingly the factor on which the satisfac­

tion and confidence of the citizens in relation to the executive
depend, as does the execution (or dilution and frustration) of
the government's intentions - in the sense that the

manner in

which these intentions are executed may well be rated as
highly by the feelings
citizens] as the

content

[Empfindung]

and disposition [of the

of the intention to be implemented,

even though this content may itself be of a burdensome
nature. Because of the immediate and personal character of
such contact, control from above can attain its end in this
respect only partially, and this end may also encounter
obstacles in the shape of the common interest of the officials
in maintaining solidarity amongst themselves in opposition to

33 4

Ethical Life

§ § 294-297

their subordinates and superiors. The need to remove such
obstacles, especially in cases where the institutions in question
may still be relatively imperfect in other respects also, calls
for and justifies the higher intervention of the sovereign (as,
for example, of Frederick the Great in the notorious case

[Sache]

of the miller Arnold). J

Whether or not dispassionateness, integrity

[Reclztlichkeit], and polite
customary will depend in part on direct education in
ethics and in thought, for this provides a spiritual counterweight to the

behaviour become

mechanical exercises and the like which are inherent in learning the
so-called sciences appropriate to these [administrative] spheres, in
the required business training, in the actual work itself, etc. But the

size of the state is also an important consideration, for it both reduces
the burden of family ties and other private commitments and lessens
the power - and thereby takes the edge off - such passions as revenge,
hatred, etc. These subjective aspects disappear of their own accord in
those who are occupied with the larger interests of a major state, for
they become accustomed to dealing with universal interests, views,
and functions.

Members of the executive and civil servants constitute the bulk of the
middle class

[des Mittelsta1ltles], which embodies the educated intelli­
[rechtliclze] consciousness of the mass of the people.

gence and legal

The institutions which prevent this class from adopting the isolated
position of an aristocracy and from using its education and skill as
arbitrary means of domination are the sovereign, who acts upon it
from above, and the rights of the corporations, which act upon it from
below.
It was in this way that the administration of justice, whose
object is the proper interests of all individuals, was at one time
transformed into an instrument of profit and domination,
because knowledge

[Kellntnis] of right hid behind scholarship

and a foreign language, and knowledge of the legal process
hid behind complicated formalities.

33 5

Philosophy ofRight
Additio11 (H,G). The middle class, to which the civil servants belong, has a
political consciousness and is the most conspicuously educated class. For
this reason, it is the mainstay Qf the state as far as integrity [Reclltlichkeit]
and intelligence are concerned. Consequently, the level of a state which
has no middle class cannot be high. This is true of Russia, for example,
which has a mass of serfs and another mass of rulers. It is central to the
interests of the state that this middle class should develop, but this can
occur only in an organization like the one we have just considered, i.e. in
which legal recognition [Bereclltigzmg] is given to particular bodies which
are relatively independent, and in which the arbitrariness of officialdom is
broken down by institutions of this kind. Action in accordance with
universal right and the habit of such action are consequences of the
opposition offered by bodies which are self-sufficient in themselves.
c. The Legislative Power

§ 29 8
The legislative power has to do with the laws as such, in so far as they
are in need of new and further determination, and with those internal
concerns of the state whose content is wholly universal. This power is
itself a part of the constitution, which it presupposes and which to that
extent lies in and for itself outside the sphere which the legislative
power can d etermine directly; but the constitution does undergo
further development through the further evolution of the laws and the
progressive character of the universal concerns of government.

Additi01I (H). The constitution must be in and for itself the firm and
recognized ground on which the legislative power is based, so that it does
not first have to be constructed. Thus, the constitution is, but it just as
essentially becomes, i.e. it undergoes progressive development. This pro­
gression is a change which takes place imperceptibly and without posses­
sing the form of change. If, for example, the resources of the German
princes and their families were originally private property but were then
transformed, without conflict or opposition, into crown domains, i.e. into
resources of the state, this occurred because the princes felt the need to
maintain their possessions intact and demanded guarantees to this effect
from their country and its Estates.} Thus, the latter became involved in
the way in which the resources in question were conserved, so that the
princes no longer had exclusive control over them. Similarly, the Emperor
was at one time a judge who travelled round the Empire dispensing
justice. Then, the (merely apparent) progress of culture [Bildzmg] made it

T

Ethical Life

§§ 297-299

outwardly necessary for the Emperor to delegate this judicial office
increasingly to others, which led to the transfer of judicial power from the
person of the sovereign to [judicial] colleges.2 Thus, conditions evolve in
an apparently peaceful and imperceptible manner, with the result that a
constitution changes its character completely over a long period of time.

These matters are more precisely determined, as far as individuals are
concerned, in the following two respects:

(a) in relation to the bene­

fits which the state enables them to enjoy, and

(�)

in relation to the

services which they must perform for the state. The former include
the laws of civil right

[die privatreclltlichen Gesetze]

in general, the

rights of communities and corporations, all arrangements of a wholly
universal character, and indirectly (see § 298), the constitution as a
whole. But as for services to the state, it is only when these are
expressed in terms of

things [Dinge]

money,

as the existing and universal

value

of

and services, that they can be determined justly and at

the same time in such a way that the

partiClllar work

and services

which the individual can perform are mediated by his own arbitrary

will.
It is possible to distinguish in general terms between what is
the object

[Gegensta1zd]

of universal legislation and what

should be left to the direction

[Bestimmlmg]

of administrative

bodies or to any kind of government regulation, in that the
former includes only what is wholly universal in content - i.e.
legal determinations - whereas the latter includes the particu­
lar and the ways and means whereby measures are

ted.

implemen­

This distinction is not entirely determinate, however, if

only because a law, in order to be a law, must be more than
just a commandment in general (such as 'Thou shalt not kill'

-

cf. Remarks to § 1 40, p. 1 44"), i.e. it must be

determinate in

itself; but the more determinate it is, the more nearly capable
its content will be of being implemented as it stands. At the
same time, however, so far-reaching a determination as this

would give the laws an empirical aspect which would necess­
arily be subject to alteration when they were actually
"Translator's note: p. 176 in this edition (Hegel's reference is to the first edition).

337

Philosophy ofRight
implemented, and this would detract from their character as
laws. It is implicit in the organic unity of the powers of the
state itself that one and the same spirit decrees the universal
and brings it to determinate actuality in implementing it. - It
may at first seem remarkable that the state requires no direct
services from the numerous skills, possessions, activities, and
talents [of its citizens] and from the infinitely varied living
resources which these embody and which are at the same time
associated with the disposition [of those who possess them],
but lays claim only to the one resource which assumes the
shape of money. (Services associated with the defence of the
state against its enemies belong to those duties which will be
considered in the following section.) But money is not in fact
one particular resource among others; on the contrary, it is the
universal aspect of all of them, in so far as they express
themselves in an external existence [Dasein] in which they can
be apprehended as things [als eine SadIe]. Only at this extreme
point of externality is it possible to determine services
quantitatively and so in a just and equitable manner. - In
Plato's Republic, it is the task of the guardians to allot individu­
als to their particular estates and to specifY what particular
services they have to perform (cf Remarks to § 1 85). In feudal
monarchies, the services required of vassals were equally
indeterminate, but these vassals also had to serve in their
particular capacity, e.g. as judges.1 Services imposed in the
Orient and in Egypt in connection with immense architectural
enterprises etc. are likewise of a particular character. In these
circumstances, what is lacking is the principle of subjective
freedom whereby the individual's substantial activity (whose
content is in any case of a particular nature in the services in
question) is mediated by his own particular will. This right
cannot be enjoyed until the demand for services is expressed
in terms of the universal value, and it is itself the reason
[Grund] why this change was introduced.

Additioll (H). The two aspects of the constitution relate respectively to the
rights and services of individuals. As far as services are concerned, nearly
all of them have now been reduced to money. Military duties are now
almost the only personal service required. In earlier times, far more
claims were made on individuals in a concrete sense, and they were called

T

Ethical Life

§§

upon to work according to their skills. In our times, the state purchases
what it needs. This may at first seem an abstract, lifeless, and soulless
procedure, and it may also look as if the state has become decadent if it is
satisfied with abstract services. But it is inherent in the principle of the
modern state that all of an individual's actions should be mediated by his
will . The justice of equality, however, can be achieved far more effectively
by means of money. Otherwise, if the criterion were concrete ability, the
talented individual would be taxed much more heavily than the untalen­
ted. But the very fact that people are now required to deliver only what
they are able to deliver is a sign that public freedom is respected.

In the legislative power as a whole, the other two moments have a
primary part to play, namely the monarchy as the power of ultimate
decision, and the executive power as the advisory moment which has
concrete knowledge [Ketmtnis] and oversight of the whole with its
numerous aspects and the actual principles which have become
established within it, and knowledge of the needs of the power of the
state in particular. The final element [in the legislature] is the Estates.

Addition (H, G). One of the misconceptions concerning the state is the

view that members of the executive should be excluded from the legislat­
ive bodies, as happened, for example, in the Constituent Assembly [of
FranceV In England, ministers must be Members of Parliament, and
rightly so, since those who participate in government should be associated
with, rather than opposed to, the legislative power. The idea [Von-tel/ung]
of the so-called independence of powers contains the basic error [of
supposing] that the powers should be independent yet mutually limiting.
If they are independent, however, the unity of the state, which is the
supreme requirement, is destroyed [aujgelzoben].2

§ 3D!
The role

[Bestimmung] o f the Estates is to bring the universal interest
[Angelegetzlzeit] into existence [Existenz] not only in itself but also for
itself, i.e. to bring into existence the moment of subjective formal
freedom, the public consciousness as the empirical univmality of the
views and thoughts of the many.
The expression 'the many' (ot 11:0).).0£) denotes empirical
universality more accurately than the usual term 'air. For if it
33 9

299-301

Philosophy ofRight
is said to be obvious that the term 'air excludes from the start
at least children, women, etc., it is by the same token even
more obvious that the entirely specific expression

'air

ought

not to be used ,vith reference to something else which is
entirely unspecific. I - In fact, such untold numbers of warped
and erroneous ideas

[Vorstellungetl]

and turns of phrase con­

cerning 'the people', 'the constitution', and 'the Estates' have
passed into current opinion that it would be a futile endeavour
to try to enumerate, discuss, and rectifY them. The idea with
which the ordinary consciousness usually begins when it con­
siders the necessity or usefulness of a convention of the
Estates will generally be, for example, that delegates of the
people, or indeed the people themselves,

must know best what

is in their own best interest, and that their own will is

undoubtedly the one best equipped to pursue the latter. As for

the first of these propositions, the reverse is in fact the case,
for if .the term 'the people' denotes a particular category of
members of the state, it refers to that category of citizens who

do not !mow their own will. To know what one wills, and even
more, to know what the will which has being in and for itself i.e. reason - wills, is the fruit of profound cognition and
insight, and this is the very thing

[Sadze]

which 'the people'

lack. - It can be seen with a little reflection that the guarantee
which the Estates provide for universal welfare and public
freedom does not lie in any particular insight they may pos­
sess. For the highest officials within the state necessarily have
a more profound and comprehensive insight into the nature of
the state's institutions and needs, and are more familiar with
its functions and more skilled in dealing with them, so that
they are able to do what is best even without the Estates, just as
they must continue to do what is best when the Estates are in
session. The guarantee doubtless lies rather in the extra
insight which the delegates have, first of all into the activities
of those officials who are less visible to their superiors, and in
particular into the more urgent and specialized needs and
deficiencies which they [the delegates] see in concrete form
before their eyes; and secondly, it lies in the effect which the
expectation of criticism, indeed of public criticism, at the
hands of the many has in compelling the officials to apply their

3 40

Ethical Life
best insights, even before they start, to their functions and to
the plans they intend to submit, and to put these into effect
only in accordance with the purest of motives. (This compul­
sion is equally effective for the members of the Estates them­
selves.) But as for the [belief that there is] particular good will
on the part of the Estates towards the universal welfare, we
have already noted (see Remarks to § 272) that it is character­
istic of the rabble, and of the negative viewpoint in general, to
assume ill will, or less good will , on the part of the govern­
ment. If this assumption were to be answered in kind, it would
invite the counter-accusation that, since the Estates have their
origin in individuality

[Einzelheit], in the private point of view

and in particular interests, they are inclined to direct their
efforts towards these at the expense of the universal interest,
whereas the other moments in the power of the state are by
their very nature

[schon flir sidz] dedicated to the universal end

and disposed to adopt the point ofview of the state. As for that
general guarantee which is supposed to lie in the Estates in

particular, each of the other institutions within the state shares
with them the quality of being a guarantee of public welfare
and rational freedom; and in some of these institutions - such
as the sovereignty of the monarch, hereditary succession, the
constitution of the courts, etc. - this guarantee is present to a
much greater degree. The proper conceptual definition

[Begriffibestit1lt1ltmg]

of the Estates should therefore be sought

in the fact that, in them, the subjective moment of universal
freedom - the personal

[eige1le]

insight and personal will of

that sphere which has been described in this work as civil
society - comes

i1lto existe1lce in relation [Beziell1l1lg] to the state.

As in every other case, the philosophical viewpoint here
enables us to conclude that this moment is a determination of
the Idea when the latter has reached its total development,
and the inner necessity of this moment should not be con­
fused with

external necessities and utilities.

Addition (H). The attitude of the government towards the Estates should

not be essentially hostile, and the belief that this relationship is necessarily
a hostile one is a sad mistake. The government is not a party opposed to
another party in such a way that both have to fight for major concessions
from each other; and if a state does get into a predicament of this kind,

34 1

Philosophy ofRight
this cannot be described as health but only as a misfortune.2 Besides, the
taxes which the estates approve should not be regarded as a gift presented
to the state; on the contrary, they are approved for the benefit of those
who approve them. The proper significance of the Estates is that it is
through them that the state enters into the subjective consciousness of the
people, and that the people begins to participate in the state.

time, this position means that they share the mediating function of the

hence simply as an arbitrary power of domination - and on the other,
that the particular interests of communities,

do not become isolated either. Or more

important still, they ensure that individuals do not present themselves
as a crowd or aggregate, unorganized in their opinions and volition, and
do not become a massive power in opposition to the organic state.!
It is one of the most important insights of logic that a specific
moment which, when it stands in opposition, has the position
of an extreme, loses this quality and becomes an organic
moment by being simultaneously a mean. 2 It is all the more
important to stress this aspect in the present context, because
it is a common but highly dangerous prejudice to represent

[vor.wstellen] the Estates chiefly from the point of view of their
opposition to the government, as if this were their essential
position. It is only through their mediating function that the
Estates display their organic quality, i.e. their incorporation in
the totality. In consequence, their opposition is itself reduced
to a [mere] semblance. If this opposition does make its
appearance, and if it is not just superficial but actually takes
on a substantial character, the state is close to destruction. - It
is evident from the nature of the thing [Saclle] that the conflict

3 42

is not of this kind if the matters in dispute are not the essential
elements of the political organism but more specialized and
trivial things

[Dinge],

and if the passion with which even this

content is associated consists of factional rivalry over merely
subjective interests such as the higher offices of state.

Addition (H). The constitution is essentially a system of mediation. In
despotic states, where there are only rulers [Fiir.sten] and people, the
people function - if they function at all - merely as a destructive mass
opposed to all organization. But when it becomes part of the organism,
the mass attains its interests in a legitimate and orderly manner. If,
however, such means are not available, the masses will always express
themselves in a barbarous manner. This is why, in despotic states, the
despot always treats the people with indulgence and vents his wrath only
on his immediate circle. In the same way, the people in such states pay
only modest taxes, whereas in constitutional states, the taxes become
higher as a result of the people's own consciousness. In fact, in no country
are so many taxes paid as in England.

It is integral to the definition

[Bestimmung] of the universal estate - or
service of the

more precisely, the estate which devotes itself to the

government - that the universal is the end of its essential activity; and
in the Estates, as an element of the legislative power, the private estate
attains a political significance and function. In this capacity, the private
estate cannot appear either as a simple undifferentiated mass or as a
crowd split up into atomic units. It appears rather as
namely as an

estate consisting of two

what it already is,

distinct parts, the one based on

the substantial relation, and the other on particular needs and the
work through which these are mediated (see § § 2o IfI). Only in this
respect is there a genuine link between the particular which has actu­
ality in the state and the universal.
This runs counter to another prevalent idea

[Vorstellutzg]

according to which, if the private estate is raised to the level of

participating in the universal interest [Sache] via the legislative
power, it must appear therein in the form of
whether representatives are elected to

individuals,

fulfil this function or

whether every individual is in fact to have a vote hirnself.I
This atomistic and abstract view ceases to apply even within
343

Philosophy ofRight
the family, as well as in civil society, where the individual
makes his appearance only as a member of a universal. But the
state is essentially an organization whose members constitute
circles in their own right [fUr sich], and no moment within it
should appear as an unorganized crowd. The many as single
individuals - and this is a favourite interpretation of [the term]
'the people' - do indeed live together, but only as a crowd, i.e. a
formless mass whose movement and activity can consequendy
only be elemental, irrational, barbarous, and terrifying. If we
hear any further talk of 'the people' as an unorganized whole,
we know in advance that we can expect only generalities and
one-sided declamations. - The idea [Vorstellung] that those
communities which are already present in the circles referred
to above can be split up again into a collection of individuals as
soon as they enter the sphere ofpolitics - i.e. the sphere of the
highest concrete universality - involves separating civil and
political life from each other and leaves political life hanging,
so to speak, in the air; for its basis is then merely the abstract
individuality of arbitrary will and opinion, and is thus
grounded only on contingency rather than on a foundation
which is stable and legitimate [berechtigt] in and for itself. Although the estates of civil society in general and the Estates in
the political sense are represented, in so-called [political]
theories, as remote from each other, linguistic usage still
preserves the unity which they certainly possessed in earlier
times.

The Estates in their political capacity still retain within their own
determination those distinctions between different estates which were
already present in the preceding spheres. Their initially abstract posi­
tion - namely as the extreme of empirical universality as opposed to the
principle of the sovereign or monarch in general - contains only the
possibility of agreement, and hence also the possibility of hostile opposi­
tion. This abstract position becomes a rational relation (i.e. a [logical]
conclusion - cf. Remarks to § 3 02) only when its mediation comes into
existence [Existenz]. Just as, in the case of the power of the sovereign,
this function [Bestimmzmg] is already fulfilled by the executive power
3 44

Ethical Life
(see § 3 00), so in the case of the estates must one of their moments be
given the function of existing essentially as a moment of mediation.

One of the estates of civil society contains the principle which is in
itself capable of being adapted to this political relation [Beziehung],
namely the estate of natural ethical life; its basis is the life of the
family and, as far as its livelihood is concerned, landed property.
Thus, in its particular aspect, this estate shares that independent
volition and natural determination which is also contained in the
moment [Element] of sovereignty.

This estate is better equipped for its political role and significance
inasmuch as its resources are equally independent of the resources of
the state and of the uncertainty of trade, the quest for profit, and all
variations in property. It is likewise independent of the favour of the
executive power and of the masses, and is even protected against its
own arbitrari11ess by the fact that those members of this estate who are
called to this vocation [Bestimmzmg] do not have the same right as
other citizens either to dispose freely of their entire property or to
know that it will pass on to their children in proportion to the equal
degree of love that they feel for them. Thus, their resources become
inalienable inherited property, burdened with primogeniture.

Addition (H). This estate has a more independent [fiir sich bestehem/J
volition. On the whole, the estate of landowners can be divided into the
educated section and the estate of farmers. Distinct from both of these,
however, are the estate of trade and industry, which is dependent on
needs and their satisfaction, and the universal estate, which is essentially
dependent on the state. The security and stability of this [landowning]
estate can be further enhanced by the institution of primogeniture, but
this is desirable only in a political sense, for it involves a sacrifice for the
political end of enabling the eldest son to live independently. The justifi­
cation of primogeniture lies in the fact that the state should be able to
count on a disposition [to political service] not just as a possibility, but as
necessarily present. Now it is true that such a disposition is not tied to the
possession of resources; but the relatively necessary connection between
345

Philosophy ofRight
the two consists in the fact that someone of independent means is not
limited by external circumstances, and is accordingly able to play his part
without encumbrance, and to act in the interests of the state. But where
no political institutions are present, the foundation and furtherance of
primogeniture are merely fetters on the freedom of civil right, and they
must either acquire a political significance, or face eventual extinction."

" Translator's note: This final sentence appears to be Gans's own addition, since it has no
counterpart in either Hotho's or Griesheirn's notes, on which Gans's Additions are
based.

In this way, the right of this section of the substantial estate is indeed
based on the natural principle of the family; but at the same time, this

is given a new direction by stringent sacrifices for the politi­
cal end, so that this estate is essentially eligible for activities connected
with the latter. Consequently, it is likewise called and entitled to such a

occupies a firm and substantial position between the subjective

rights of the other extreme, so that it becomes a support both of the
throne and of [civil] society.

so far as these deputies are elected by civil society, it is immediately
evident that, in electing them, society acts as what it is. That is, it is not
split up into individual atomic units which are merely assembled for a
moment to perform a single temporary act and have no further cohe­
sion; on the contrary, it is articulated into its associations, communi­
ties, and corporations which, although they are already in being,

Ethical Lift
acquire in this way a political connotation. In the entitlement of this
estate to elect deputies at the request of the sovereign power, and in
the entitlement of the first estate to appear [in person] (see § 307), the
existence [Existe1lz] of the Estates and of their assembly acquires its
own constitutional guarantee.
The idea [Vorstellung] that all individuals ought to participate
in deliberations and decisions on the universal concerns of the
state - on the grounds that they are all members of the state
and that the concerns of the state are the concerns of everyone,
so that everyone has a right to share in them with his own
knowledge and volition - seeks to implant in the organism of
the state a democratic element devoid of rationalfornI, although
it is only by virtue of its rational form that the state is an
organism. This idea [VorstellU1lg] appears plausible precisely
because it stops short at the abstract determination of mem­
bership of the state and because superficial thinking sticks to
abstractions. Rational deliberation or the consciousness of the
Idea [Idee] is concrete, and it coincides to that extent with true
practical sense, which is itself nothing other than rational sense
or the sense of the Idea; it must not, however, be confused
with the mere routine of business and the horizon of a limited
sphere. The concrete state is the whole, artiCltlated into its
particular circles. Each member of the state is a member of an
estate of this kind, and only in this objective determination can
he be considered in relation to the state. His universal
determination in general includes two moments, for he is a
pn'vate person and at the same time a thinking being with con­
sciousness and volition of the universal. But this consciousness
and volition remain empty and lack fulfilme1lt and actual lift
until they are filled with particularity, and this is [to be found
in] a particular estate and determination. Otherwise, the
individual remains a ge1leric category [GattU1lg], but only within
the next generic category does he attain his immane1lt universal
actuality. - Consequently, it is within the sphere of his cor­
poration, community, etc. (see § 25 I) that the individual first
attains his actual and living determination as universal, and it
remains open to him to enter any sphere, including the
universal estate, for which his aptitude qualifies him The idea

however (see §

Since deputies are elected to deliberate and decide on matters of

ulliversal concern,

the aim of such elections is to appoint individuals

who are credited by those who elect them with a better understanding
of such matters than they themselves possess. It is also the intention
that these individuals will not subordinate the universal interest to the
particular interest of a community or corporation, but will give it their
essential support. Their position is accordingly not that of commis­
sioned or mandated agents, especially since the purpose

[Bestimmung]

of their assembly is to provide a forum for live exchanges and collec­
tive deliberations in which the participants instruct and convince one

that anyone who becoITles a member of the Estates should possess a
character, insight, and will consistent with his task of participating in
universal concerns. For it is not essential that the individual

[Individuum]

should have a say as an abstract individual entity; on the contrary, all that

matters is that his interests should be upheld in an assembly which deals
with universal issues. The electors require a guarantee that the elected
deputy will promote and accomplish this end.

Ethical Life
§ 3 10
In the second section of the Estates, whose members are drawn from

the changing and variable element in civil society, the guarantee that
the deputies will have the qualities and disposition required for this
end - for independent means have already claimed their right in the
first section - consists above all in the disposition, skill, and know­
ledge [Kenntnis] of the institutions and interests of the state and civil
society which they have acquired through the actual conduct of busi­
ness in positions of authority or political office, and which have proved
their worth in practice; it further consists in the sense ofauthority and
political sense which they have developed and put to the test in the
process.
The subjective opinion which individuals have of themselves
may well find the demand for such guarantees, if it is made
with explicit reference to 'the people', superfluous and
perhaps even insulting. But the determination of the state is
objectivity, not subjective opinion and the self-confidence
which accompanies it. The state is concerned only with those
aspects of individuals which are objectively recognizable and
which have been tried and tested, and it must pay all the more
attention to such aspects in the case of the second section of
the Estates, because this section is rooted in interests and
activities which are directed towards the particular, and in
which contingency, mutability, and arbitrary will have the
right to express themselves. - Taken on its own, the external
qualification of possessing a certain amount of property has
the appearance of a one-sided extreme of externality in con­
trast to the other, equally one-sided, extreme of the purely
subjective trust and opinion of the electorate. Both of these
extremes contrast, in their abstraction, with those concrete
qualities which are necessary for deliberations on political
business, and which are contained within the specifications
[Bestimmungen] indicated in § 3 02. - Nevertheless, the selec­
tion of individuals for positions of authority and other offices
within corporations [Genossenschafien] and communities does
constitute a sphere in which the property qualification has
been able to operate effectively, particularly if some of these
349

§§ 308-3 10

Philosophy ojRight
tasks are performed without remuneration; and it is directly
relevant to the business of the Estates if the members do not
receive a salary.!

In view of the fact that the deputies are elected by civil society, it is
also desirable that they should be familiar with and party to its special
needs, frustrations, and particular interests. Given the nature of civil
society, the deputies are elected by the various corporations (see

§ 3 08), and this simple mode of procedure is not impaired by abstrac­
tions and atomistic notions

[Vorstellzmgen]

[of society] . Consequently,

it directly fulfils the requireme�t referred to above, and the election
itself is either completely superfluous or can be reduced to an insig­
nificant play of arbitrary opinion.
It is clearly in the general interest that the deputies should
include individuals who are thoroughly familiar with, and per­
sonally involved in, each particular major branch of society
(e.g. commerce, manufacturing industries, etc.) - an import­
ant consideration which the idea

[Vorstellzmg]

of loose and

indeterminate elections leaves entirely to chance. Each of
these branches of society, however, has the same right as the
others to be represented. If the deputies are regarded as

representatives,

this term cannot be applied to them in an

organic and rational sense unless they are

hzdividuals

represelltatives not of
spheres of

as a crowd, but of one of the essential

society, i.e. of its major interests. Thus, representation no
longer means the

replacemellt of one individual by allother;
actually present in

the contrary, the interest itself is

on
its

representative, and the latter is there to represent the objec­
tive element he himself embodies. - As for mass elections, it
may also be noted that, in large states in particular, the elec­
torate inevitably becomes

illdifferent in view of the fact that a

single vote has little effect when numbers are so large; and
however highly they are urged to value the right to vote, those

who enjoy this right will simply fail to make use of it. As a
result, an institution of this kind achieves the opposite of its
intended purpose

[Bestimmu1Zg], and the election comes under

the control of a few people, of a faction, and hence of that

designed to neutralize.

ces a particular modification to the process of deliberation; and since
one of the moments in question also has the characteristic function of

moment must likewise take on a separate existence

This division, by creating a plurality of itlstatlCes, not only provides an
increased guarantee of mature decisions and eliminates the con­
tingent quality which the mood of the moment" possesses and which
decisions by majority vote may acquire. Above all, it ensures that the
Estates are less likely to come into direct opposition to the govern­
ment; and if the mediating moment also happens to take the side of
the second Estate, the latter's view will carry all the more weight, for it
will appear more impartial and its opposition will appear to be
neutralized.
"Translator's note: Hegel's phrase 'Stimmung des Augenblicks' is (perhaps intentionally)
ambiguous: it may mean either 'mood of the moment' or possibly 'instantaneous vote'
(although present-day German would use the term Abstilllllllmg in the latter context).

The determination of the Estates as an institution does not require
them to achieve optimum results in their deliberations and decisions
on the business of the state

in itself,

for their role in this respect is

purely accessory (see § 30I). On the contrary , they have the distinc­
tive function

[Besti11l11l11ng]

of ensuring that, through their participa­

tion in [the government's] knowledge, deliberations, and decisions on
matters of universal concern, the moment offont/al freedom attains its
right in relation to those members of civil society who have no share in
the government. In this way, it is first and foremost the moment of
35I

Philosoplzy ofRight
It1ziversal knowledge [Kemztnis] which is extended by the publicity with
which the proceedings of the Estates are conducted.

The provision of this opportunity of [acquiring] knowledge [Kenntnis­
sen] has the more universal aspect of permitting public opinion to arrive
for the first time at tnle thoughts and insight with regard to the condi­
tion and concept of the state and its affairs, thereby enabling it to fonn
more rational judgements on the latter. In this way, the public also
becomes familiar with, and learns to respect, the functions, abilities,
virtues, and skills of the official bodies and civil servants. And just as
such publicity provides a signal opportunity for these abilities to
develop, and offers them a platform on which they may attain high
honours, so also does it constitute a remedy for the self-conceit of
individuals and of the mass, and a means - indeed one of the most
important means - of educating them.

Addition (H,G). If the Estates hold their assemblies in public, they afford
a great spectacle of outstanding educational value to the citizens, and it is
from this above all that the people can learn the true nature of their
interests. As a rule, it is accepted that everyone already knows what is
good for the state, and that the assembly of the Estates merely discusses
this knowledge. But in fact, precisely the opposite is the case, for it is only
in such assemblies that those virtues, abilities, and skills are developed
which must serve as models [for others]. These assemblies are, of course,
tiresome for ministers, who must themselves be armed with wit and
eloquence if they are to counter the attacks which are here directed
against them. Nevertheless, such publicity is the most important means of
education as far as the interests of the state in general are concerned. In a
nation where this publicity exists, there is a much more lively attitude
towards the state than in one where the Estates have no assembly or
where such assemblies are not held in public. It is only by informing the
public of every move they make that the two houses remain in touch with
the wider implications of public opinion. It then becomes evident that a
man's imaginings at home in the company of his wife or friends are very
different from events in a great assembly, where one ingenious idea
[Gescheitheit] devours another.

35 2

Ethical Life

Fonnal subjective freedom, whereby individuals as such entertain and
express their own judgements, opinions, and counsels on matters of
universal concern, makes its collective appearance in what is known as
public opinion. In the latter, the universal in and for itself, the substan­
tial and the true, is linked with its opposite, with what is disti,la in itself
[dem for sich Eigentiimliclml] as the particular opinions of the many.
This existence [Existenz] [of public opinion] is therefore a manifest
self-contradiction, an appearance of cognition; in it, the essential is just
as immediately present as the inessential.

Addition (G). Public opinion is the unorganized way in which the will and
opinions of the people make themselves known. Whatever actually gains
recognition within the state must, of course, perform an organic function,
'
as is the case with the constitution. But public opinion has been a major
force in all ages, and this is particularly so in our own times, in which the
principle of subjective freedom has such importance and significance.
Whatever is to achieve recognition today no longer achieves it by force,
and only to a small extent through habit and custom, but mainly through
insight and reasoned argument.

Public opinion therefore embodies not only the eternal and substan­
tial principles of justice - the true content and product of the entire
constitution and legislation and of the universal condition in general ­
in the fonn of common sense [des gesunden Menschenverstandes] (the
ethical foundation which is present in everyone in the shape of
prejudices), but also the true needs and legitimate [richtigerl]
tendencies of actuality. - As soon as this inner content attains con­
sciousness and is represented [zur Vorstellullg kommt] in general prop­
ositions (either in its own right [/iir sich] or for the purpose of concrete
reasoning [Riisomliererl] on felt needs and on events, dispensations,
and circumstances within the state), all the contingencies of opinion,
with its ignorance and perverseness, its false infoi:mation and its
errors of judgement, come on the scene. Since what is at issue here is
the consciousness of the distinctive nature [Eigentiimlicllkeit] of the
views and knowledge [Kemltnis] [of individuals], the worse the content
of an opinion is, the more distinctive it will be; for the bad is that

353

Philosophy ofRight
whose content is entirely particular and distinctive, whereas the
rational is that which is universal in and for itself, and the distinctive is
that on which opinion prides itself.
It must therefore not be regarded as a subjective difference of
views if we are told on the one hand that the voice of the
people is the voice of God [Vox populi, vox dei], and on the
other (by Ariosto, for example):f
Che'l Volgare ignorante ogn' un riprenda
parli pill di que! che meno intenda."1

E

Public opinion contains these two qualities simultaneously,
and if truth and endless error are so closely united within it, it
cannot be genuinely serious about them both. It may seem
difficult to decide which to take seriously, and this will in fact
be the case even if we stick to the immediate expression of public
opinion. But since the substantial is its inner content, only this
can be taken completely seriously. The substantial cannot be
known [erka1l11t] from public opinion itself, however; its very
substantiality means that it can be recognized only in and from
itself [aus 111ldfiir siclz]. No matter how passionately an opinion
is held or how seriously it is asserted or attacked or contested,
this is no criterion of what is really at issue; but the last thing
which this opinion can be made to realize is that its serious­
ness is not serious at all. A leading spirit [eill grofter Geist] set
as the theme of an essay competition the question 'whether it
is permissible to deceive a people'3 The only possible answer
was that it is impossible to deceive a people about its substan­
tial basis, about the essence and specific character of its spirit,
but that the people is deceived by itselfabout the way in which
this character is known to it and in which it consequently
passes judgement on events, its own actions, etc.

Additio1l (H). The principle of the modern world requires that whatever is

to be recognized by everyone must be seen by everyone as entitled to such
recognition. But in addition, each individual wishes to be consulted and to
be given a hearing. Once he has fulfilled this responsibility and had his
say, his subjectivity is satisfied and he will put up with a great deal. In
France, freedom of speech was alwaysa regarded as less dangerous than
silence, for if people remained silent, it was feared that they were keeping
their opposition to something to themselves, whereas argument [Riisolllle­

facilitates the progress of the matter [Sache] in question.

"Translator's note: The word immer ('always') does not appear in Hotho's notes, from
which Gans compiled this Addition.

Public opinion therefore deserves to be respected as well as despised
despised for its concrete consciousness and expression, and respected
for its essential basis, which appears in that concrete consciousness
only in a more or less obscure manner. Since it contains no criterion
of discrimination and lacks the ability to raise its own substantial
aspect to [the level of] determinate knowledge, the first formal condi­
tion of achieving anything great or rational, either in actuality or in
science, is to be independent of public opinion. Great achievement
may in turn be assured that public opinion will subsequently accept it,
recognize it, and adopt it as one of its prejudices.

opinion as he here and there encounters it.

Freedom of public communication (of whose two modes the press has
a wider range of contact than the spoken word, although it lacks the

latter's vitality), the satisfaction of the burning urge to express one's
opinion and to have expressed it, is directly guaranteed by those laws
and ordinances, as upheld by the police, which prevent or punish its
excesses. It is indirectly guaranteed, however, by its innocuous
character, which it owes chiefly to the rationality of the constitution
and the stability of the government, but also to the publicity of the
assemblies of the Estates. It is rendered innocuous by the latter
because these assemblies give expression to sound

and

educated insights concerning the interests of the state, leaving little of
significance for others to say, and above all denying them the opinion
that what they have to say is of distinctive importance and effective­
ness. But it is also guaranteed by the indifference and scorn which
shallow and malicious talk quickly and inevitably brings down upon
itself.
To define freedom of the press as freedom to say and write

whatever otle pleases is equivalent to declaring that freedom in
to do whatever otle pleases. Such talk

is the product of completely uneducated, crude, and super­

[Sac/Ie] that �g [FOnllalis11lus] is nowhere

case

so stubborn and uncompromising as it is with this matter, for
the subject in question is the most fleeting, contingent, and

particular aspect of opinion in the infinite variety of its content
and modulations. Beyond direct incitement to theft, murder,
rebellion, etc. lie the art and cultivation [Bi/dutlg] ofits expres­
sion, which seems in itself [fiir sich] quite general and indeter­
minate yet at the same time conceals another quite specific
meaning, or leads to consequences which are not actually
expressed and of which it is impossible to determine whether
they follow legitimately

[rielltig] from it and whether they were

meant to be drawn from it or not. This indeterminacy of the
material and its form makes it impossible for laws on such
matters to attain that determinacy which the law requires; and
since any misdemeanour, wrong, or injury
assumes the most particular and
on it likewise becomes a wholly

subjective shape, judgement
subjective decision. Besides,

such an injury will be directed at the thoughts, opinion, and

will of others, and they are the element in which it attains

Ethical Life
actuality. But this element is part of the freedom of others,
and it will therefore depend on them whether or not the
injurious action constitutes an actual deed. - Laws in this area
are therefore open to criticism on account of their
indeterminacy, and also because turns of phrase and forms of
expression can be devised in order to circumvent the law or to
maintain that the judicial decision is a subjective judgement. It
can further be argued, if the [offending] expression is treated
as an injuriolls act, that it is not an act at all, but only opinion
and thought on the one hand and talk on the other. Thus, it is
argued in one breath that mere opinion and talk should be
a:empt from plttlishment because their form and content are
purely subjective and because they are itlSignijiCatlt and !l1lim­
portant, and that this same opinion and talk should be highly
respected and esteemed on the grounds that the former is per­
sonal property of the most spiritual kind, and that the latter is
the expression and use of this personal property. - But the
substantial [issue here] is and remains the fact that all injuries
to the honour of individuals, slander, abuse, vilification of the
government, of its official bodies and civil servants, and in
particular of the sovereign in person, contempt for the laws,
incitement to rebellion, etc., are crimes and misdemeanours
of widely varying degrees of gravity. The fact that such actions
become more indeterminable as a result of the element in
which they are expressed does not annul [hebt nidlt atifl this
substantial character, and its effect is therefore simply [to
ensure] that the subjective sphere [Boden] in which they are
committed also determines the nature and shape of the reaction.
It is this very sphere in which the misdemeanour is committed
which necessarily leads to subjectivity of view, contingency,
etc., in the reaction to it, whether this reaction consists of
measures taken by the police to prevent crime, or of punish­
ment proper. Here as always, formalistic thinking [Foml­
alismus] endeavours to rationalize away [wegzuriisonnieren] the
substantial and concrete nature of the thing [Sache] in favour
of individual aspects which belong to its external appearance
and of abstractions which it derives from these. - The sciences,
however - that is, if they really are sciences - have no place at
all in the sphere of opinion and subjective views, nor does

3 57

Philosophy ofRight
their presentation consist in the art of allusions, turns of
phrase, half-utterances and semi-concealment, but in the
unambiguous, determinate, and open expression of their
meaning and sense. Consequently, they do not come under
the category of public opinion (see § 3 I 6).1 - Besides, as I
have already pointed out, the element in which views and their
modes of expression as such become completed actiolls and
attain actual existence [Existe1lz] is the intelligence, principles,
and opinions of others. Consequently, this aspect of actions i.e. their proper effect and the dallger they hold for individuals,
society, and the state (cf. § 2 1 8) - likewise depends on the
nature of this element [Bode1l], just as a spark thrown on to a
powderkeg is far more dangerous than if it falls on solid
ground, where it disappears without trace. - Thus, just as
scientific utterances have their right and safeguard in their
material and content, so also is there a safeguard, or at least
[an element of] toleration, for wrongful utterances in the con­
tempt which they bring upon themselves. Some mis­
demeanours of this kind, which may even be legally
punishable in themselves, are attributable to that variety of
lIe111esis which inner impotence, when it feels oppressed by
superior talents and virtues, is impelled to exact in order to
reassert itself in the face of such superiority and to give
renewed self-consciousness to its own nullity. Thus, the
Roman soldiers used to inflict a relatively harmless nemesis
on their emperors by singing satirical songs during triumphal
processions in order to compensate for their arduous service
and obedience, and especially for the fact that their names
were not included in the roll of honour; in this way, the
balance was to some extent redressed.2 The former base and
spiteful variety of nemesis is rendered ineffectual by the con­
tempt which it incurs, and, like the public which may provide
an audience for such activities, it is confined to empty malice
and to the self-condemnation which is implicit within it.

§ 3 20
Subjectivity, whose most extenral manifestation is the dissolution of the
existing life of the state by opinion and ratiocination as they seek to

Ethical Life

§§ 3 I9-322

assert their contingent character and thereby destroy themselves, has
its true actuality in its own opposite, i.e. in mbjeaivity as identical with
the substantial will, the subjectivity which constitutes the concept of
the power of the sovereign and which, as the ideality of the whole, has
not up till now attained its right and its existence [Dasein].

Addition (H). We have considered subjectivity once already in connection
,vith the monarch as the apex of the state. Its other aspect is its arbitrary
appearance in public opinion as its most externala manifestation. The
subjectivity of the monarch is in itself abstract, but it should be concrete
in character as the ideality which pervades the whole. The peaceful state
is that in which all branches of civil life subsist, while their collective and
separate subsistence proceeds from the Idea of the whole. This process
[Heroorgehen] must also make its appearallce as the ideality of the whole.
aTranslator's note: Gans here uses the adjective lilljJersten ('most extreme'), which should
in fact be lilljJerlicllsten ('most external'), as in Hotho's original notes (VP R 1II, 826) and
in § 320 itself.

II

External Sovereigllty

Internal sovereigllty (see § 2 7 8) is this ideality in so far as the moments
of the spirit and of its actuality, the state, have developed in their
necessity and subsist as members of the state. But the spirit, which in its
freedom is illfillitely negative reference to itself, is just as essentially
being-jOr-itself which has incorporated the subsistent differences into
itself and is accordingly exclusive. In this determination, the state has
individuality, which is [present] essentially as an individual and, in the
sovereign [Souveran], as an actual and immediate individual (see
§ 279)·

§ 3 22
Individuality, as exclusive being-for-itself, appears as the relation [of
the state] to other states, each of which is independent [selbstiindig] in
relation to the others. Since the being-jOr-itselfof the actual spirit has
its existence [Dasein] in this independence, the latter is the primary
freedom and supreme dignity of a nation [eines Volkes].
35 9

Philosophy ofRight
Those who speak of the wishes of a totality [Gesamtheit] which
constitutes a more or less independent state with its own
centre to abandon this focal point and its own independence
in order to form a whole with another state know little of the
nature of a totality and of the self-awareness which an auto­
nomous nation possesses.} - Hence, the primary authority
[Gewalt] which states possess when they make their
appearance in history is quite simply this independence, even
if it is completely abstract and without any inner development.
It is therefore in keeping with this original appearance that the
head of state should be an individual, such as a patriarch or a
tribal chief.

In existence [Dasein] this negative relation [Beziehung] of the state to
itself thus appears as the relation of another to another, as if the
negative were something extenlal. The existence [Existenz] of this
negative relation therefore assumes the shape of an event, of an
involvement with contingent occurrences coming from without.
Nevertheless, this negative relation is the state's own highest moment
- its actual infinity as the ideality of everything finite within it. It is that
aspect whereby the substance, as the state's absolute power over
everything individual and particular, over life, property, and the lat­
ter's rights, and over the wider circles within it, gives the nullity of
such things an existence [Dasein] and makes it present to the
consciousness.

This determination whereby the interests and rights of individuals
[der Einzehlen] are posited as a transient moment is at the same time
their positive aspect, i.e. that aspect of their individuality [Individu­
alitat] which is not contingent and variable, but has being itl and for
itself. This relation and its recognition are therefore the substantial
duty of individuals - their duty to preserve this substantial individu­
ality - i.e. the independence and sovereignty of the state - even if
their own life and property, as well as their opinions and all that
naturally falls within the province of life, are endangered or sacrificed.

1

Ethical Life
It is a grave miscalculation if the state, when it requires this
sacrifice, is simply equated with civil society, and ifits ultimate
end is seen merely as the security of the life atld property of
individuals [Individuen]. For this security cannot be achieved
by the sacrifice of what is supposed to be secured - on the
contrary. - The ethical momtmt of war is implicit in what was
stated above. For war should not be regarded as an absolute
evil [ Obe� and as a purely external contingency whose cause
[Grund] is therefore itself contingent, whether this cause lies
in the passions of rulers or nations [Vb"lker], in injustices etc.,
or in anything else which is not as it should be. Whatever is by
nature contingent is subject to contingencies, and this fate is
therefore itself a necessity - just as, in all such cases, philo­
sophy and the concept overcome the point of view of mere
contingency and recognize it as a semblance whose essence is
necessity. It is necessary that the finite - such as property and
life - should be posited as contingent, because contingency is
the concept of the finite. On the one hand, this necessity
assumes the shape of a natural power, and everything finite is
mortal and transient. But in the ethical essence, i.e. the state,
nature is deprived of this power, and necessity is elevated to a
work of freedom, to something ethical in character. The tran­
sience of the finite now becomes a willed evanescence, and the
negativity which underlies it becomes the substantial
individuality proper to the ethical essence. - War is that con­
dition in which the vanity of temporal things [Dinge] and
temporal goods - which tends at other times to be merely a
pious phrase - takes on a serious significance, and it is
accordingly the moment in which the ideality of the particular
attains its right and becomes actuality. The higher significance
of war is that, through its agency (as I have put it on another
occasion), 'the ethical health of nations [Volker] is preserved in
their indifference towards the permanence of finite
determinacies, just as the movement of the winds preserves
the sea from that stagnation which a lasting calm would prod­
uce - a stagnation which a lasting, not to say perpetual, peace
would also produce among nations'. I Of the allegation that
this is only a philosophical Idea or to use another common
expression - a justification of providtmce, and that actual wars

§§ 322-3 2 4

-I
Philosophy ofRight
require a further justification as well, more will be said below.2
- The ideality which makes its appearance in war in the shape
of a contingent external relationship is the same as the ideality
whereby the internal powers of the state are organic moments
of the whole. This is apparent in various occurrences in
history, as when successful wars have averted internal unrest
and consolidated the internal power of the state.3 Other
phenomena [Ersc/lei1lt111getl] of the same kind include the fol­
lowing: nations which are reluctant or afraid to accept internal
sovereignty may be subjugated by others, and their failure to
attain honour and success in their struggles for independence
has been proportionate to their initial failure to organize the
power of the state from within (Le. their freedom has died
from the fear of dying); and states whose independence is
guaranteed not by their armed strength but by other factors
(as in those states which are disproportionately small in rela­
tion to their neighbours) have been able to surv've [bestehetl]
with an internal constitution which would not on 11.u own have
secured either internal or external peace.

Additioll (G). In peace, the bounds of civil life are extended, all its spheres

become firmly established, and in the long run, people become stuck in
their ways. Their particular characteristics [PartikularitiitetlJ become
increasingly rigid and ossified. But the unity of the body is essential to the
health, and if its parts grow internally hard, the result is death. Perpetual
peace is often demanded as an ideal to which mankind should approx­
imate. Thus, Kant proposed a league of sovereigns to settle disputes
between states, and the Holy Alliance was meant to be an institution more
or less of this kind! But the state is an individual, and negation is an
essential component of individuality. Thus, even if a number of states join
together as a family, this league, in its individuality, must generate opposi­
tion and create an enemy. Not only do peoples emerge from wars with
added strength, but nations [NatiolletlJ troubled by civil dissension gain
internal peace as a result of wars with their external enemies. Admittedly,
war makes property insecure, but this real insecurity is no more than a
necessary movement. We hear numerous sermons on the insecurity,
vanity, and instability of temporal things, but all who hear them, however
moved they may be, believe that they will none the less retain what is
theirs. But if this insecurity should then actually become a serious pro­
position in the shape ofhussars \vith sabres drawn, the edifying sentiments
which predicted all this tum into imprecations against the conquerors.

[Gegensta11d], and therein lies the chief voca­
particular group to which the defence of the

state is entrusted. But in so far as the state as such and its
independence are at risk, duty requires all citizens to rally to its
defence.} If the entire state has thus become an armed power and

is

wrenched away from its own internal life to act on an external front,
the war of defence becomes a war of conquest.
The fact that the armed power of the state becomes a standing
amlY and that the vocation [Bestimmung] for the particular task
of defending it becomes an estate is [a result of] the same
necessity whereby its other particular moments, interests, and
functions become estates such as those of marriage, trade and
industry, the civil service, business, etc. Ratiocination, which
goes back and forth over the reasons in question, indulges in
reflections on the greater advantages or disadvantages of
employing standing armies, and opinion readily comes down
on the side of the disadvantages, because the concept of a
thing

[Sache]

is more difficult to grasp than its individual and

external aspects, and also because the interests and ends of
particularity (the costs involved and their consequences,
higher taxes, etc.) are rated more highly in the consciousness

T
Philosophy ofRight
of civil society than what is necessary in and for itself, which is
accordingly regarded only as a means to particular ends.

Valour is in itself a fomlal virtue, because it is the highest abstraction
of freedom from all particular ends, possessions, pleasure, and life
(although the way in which it negates these is extemal and adual), and
because the alienation [E1ltiiu.f1erung] of these, as the enactment of
valour, is not in itself of a spiritual nature; besides, the inner disposi­
tion [associated with it] may be [the product of] this or that [particu­
lar] reason [Gnmd] , and its actual result may exist [sein] only for
others and not for itself.

Additioll (G). The military estate is the universal estate to which the
defence of the realm is entrusted, and its duty is to give existence
[Existenz] to the ideality within itself, i.e. to sacrifice itself. There are, of
course, various kinds of valour. The courage of an anim� ')r a robber,
valour for the sake of honour, and knightly valour are not its true forms.
The true valour of civilized nations [Volker] is their readiness for sacrifice
in the service of the state, so that the individual merely counts as one
among many. Not personal courage but integration with the universal is
the important factor here. In India, five hundred men defeated twenty
thousand who were not cowards, but who simply lacked the disposition to
act in close association with others. J

The significance [Gehalt] of valour as a disposition lies in the true,
absolute, and ultimate end, the sovereignty of the state. The actuality of
this ultimate end, as the product of valour, is mediated by the sur­
render of personal actuality. This phenomenon [Gestalt] therefore
embodies the harshness of extreme opposites: alienation [Entiiu.f1erung]
itself, but as the existence [Existenz] of freedom; the supreme self­
sufficiency of beillg-for-itselJ, which at the same time exists in the
mechanical service of an external order; total obedience and renuncia­
tion of personal [eigenen] opinion and reasoning [Riisollieren], and
hence personal absence of mind [des Geistes], along with the most
intense and comprehensive presence of mind and decisiveness at a
given moment; the most hostile and hence most personal action

T

Ethical Life
against individuals, along with a completely indifferent or even bene­
volent attitude [Gesillllullg] towards them as individuals.
To risk one's life is certainly superior to simply fearing death,
but it is also purely negative and therefore indetenninate and
valueless in itself. Only a positive end and content can give
significance to such courage. Robbers and murderers whose
end is crime, adventurers whose end is a product of their own
opinion, etc. also have the courage to risk their lives. - The
principle of the modem world - thought and the ulliversal - has
given a higher form [Gestalt] to valour, in that its expression
seems to be more mechanical and not so much the deed of a
particular person as that of a member of a whole. It likewise
appears to be directed not against individual persons, but
against a hostile whole in general, so that personal courage
appears impersonal. This is why the principle of thought has
invented the gull, and this invention, which did not come
about by chance, has turned the purely personal form of
valour into a more abstract form.]

The outward orientation of the state derives from the fact that it is an
individual subject. Its relationship with other states therefore comes
under the power of the sovereign, who therefore has direct and sole
responsibility for the command of the armed forces, for the conduct
of relations with other states through ambassadors etc., and for mak­
ing war and peace and concluding treaties of other kinds.

Addition (G). In almost all European countries, the supreme individual
authority is the power of the sovereign, who has control of external
relations. Where the Estates form part of the constitution, the question
may arise whether they should not be responsible for making war and
peace, and they will in any case retain their influence on the provision of
financial means in particular. In England, for example, no unpopular war
can be waged. But if it is imagined that sovereign princes and cabinets are
more subject to passion than parliaments are, and if the attempt is accord­
ingly made to transfer responsibility for war and peace into the hands of
the latter, it must be replied that whole nations are often more prone to
enthusiasms and subject to passion than their rulers are.] In England, the
entire people has pressed for war on several occasions and has in a sense

L

-1!

Philosophy ofRight
compelled the ministers to wage it. The popularity of Pitt arose from the
fact that he knew how to comply with the nation's current wishes." Only
later, when emotions had cooled, did people realize that the war was
useless and unnecessary, and that it had been entered into without cal­
culating the cost.2 Besides, the state has relations not just with one other
state, but with several; and the complexities of these relations become so
delicate that they can be handled only by the supreme authority.
aTranslator's note: The preceding sentence has no equivalent in Griesheim's notes, on
which this Addition is based (see V P R IV, 738f.).

B. International Law [Das iiuflere Staatsrecht]

International law [das iiujJere Staatsrecht] applies to the relations
between independent states. What it contains in andfor itselfthetefore
assumes the form of an obligation, because its actuality depends on
disti11ti and sovereign wills.

Addition (H). States are not private persons but completely independent

totalities in themselves, so that the relations between them are not the
same as purely moral relations or relations of private right. Attempts have
often been made to apply private right and morality to states, but the
position of private persons is that they are subject to the authority of a
court which implements what is right in itself. Now a relationship
between states ought also to be inherently governed by right, but in
worldly affairs, that which has being in itselfought also to possess power.
But since no power is present to decide what is right in itselfin relation to
the state and to actualize such decisions, this relation [Beziehtmg] must
always remain one of obligation. The relationship between states is a
relationship of independent units which make mutual stipulations but at
the same time stand above these stipulations.

The nation state [das Volk als Staat] is the spirit in its substantial
rationality and immediate actuality, and is therefore the absolute
power on earth; each state is consequently a sovereign and
independent entity in relation to others. The state has a primary and

Ethical Life
absolute entitlement to be a sovereign and independent power ill the
eyes ofothers, i.e. to be recogtzized by them. At the same time, however,
this entitlement is purely formal, and the requirement that the state
should be recognized simply because it is a state is abstract. Whether
the state does in fact have being in and for itself depends on its
content - on its constitution and [present] condition; and recognition,
which implies that the two [i.e. form and content] are identical, also
depends on the perception and will of the other state.
Without relations [Verhiilwis] with other states, the state can
no more be an actual individual [Illdividuum] than an
individual [tier Eillzellle] can be an actual person without a
relationship [Relatioll] with other persons (see § 3 22). On the
other hand, the legitimacy of a state, and more precisely - in
so far as it has external relations - of the power of its
sovereign, is a purely illternal matter (one state should not
interfere in the internal affairs of another). On the other hand,
it is equally essential that this legitimacy should be supplemro­
ted by recognition on the part of other states. But this recog­
nition requires a guarantee that the state will likewise
recognize those other states which are supposed to recognize
it, i.e. that it will respect their independence; accordingly,
these other states cannot be indifferent to its internal affairs. In the case of a nomadic people, for example, or any people at
a low level of culture, the question even arises of how far this
people can be regarded as a state. The religious viewpoint (as
in former times with the Jewish and Mohammedan nations
[Viilkern]) may further entail a higher opposition which
precludes that universal identity that recognition requires.

Additioll (G). When Napoleon said before the Peace of Campo Formio

'the French Republic is no more in need of recognition than the sun is',al
his words conveyed no more than that strength of existence [Existetlz]
which itself carries with it a guarantee of recognition, even if this is not
expressly formulated.

"Translator's note: The remainder of this sentence has no equivalent in Griesheim's
notes, on which this Addition is based (see VPR IV, 741).

L

Philosophy ofRight

The immediate actuality in which states coexist is particularized into
various relations which are determined by the independent arbitrary
wills of both parties, and which accordingly possess the formal nature
of contracts in general. The subject-matter [Sto.DJ of these contracts,
however, is infinitely less varied than it is in civil society, in which
individuals [die EinzebJe1z] are mutually interdependent in innumer­
able respects, whereas independent states are primarily wholes which
can satisfY their own needs internally.

§

333
The principle o f intenzational law [Viilkerrecht], a s that universal right
which ought to have international validity in and for itself (as distinct
from the particular content of positive treaties), is that treaties, on
which the mutual obligations of states depend, should be observed. But
since the sovereignty of states is the principle governing their mutual
relations, they exist to that extent in a state of nature in relation to one
another, and their rights are actualized not in a universal will with
constitutional powers over them, but in their own particular wills.
Consequently, the universal determination of international law
remains only an obligatioll, and the [normal] condition will be for
relations governed by treaties to alternate with the suspension
fI1.uflzebU1zg] of such relations.
There is no praetor to adjudicate between states, but at most
arbitrators and mediators, and even the presence of these will
be contingent, i.e. determined by particular wills. Kant's idea
[VorstellU1zg] of a perpetual peace guaranteed by a federation of
states which would settle all disputes and which, as a power
recognized by each individual state, would resolve all dis­
agreements so as to make it impossible for these to be settled
by war presupposes an agreement between states. But this
agreement, whether based on moral, religious, or other
grounds and considerations, would always be dependent on
particular sovereign wills, and would therefore continue to be
tainted with contingency.

T

Ethical Life
§ 334
Consequendy, if n o agreement can be reached between particular
wills, conflicts between states can be sewed only by war. Since the
sphere of the state is extensive and its relations [Beziehungen] through
its citizens are extremely varied, it may easily suffer injuries
[Verletztmgen] on many occasions. But which of these injuries should
be regarded as a specific breach of treaties or as an injury to the
recognition and honour of the state remains inherently [an sich]
indeterminable; for a state may associate its infinity and honour with
any one of its individual interests, and it will be all the more inclined
to take offence if it possesses a strong individuality which is encoura­
ged, as a result of a long period of internal peace, to seek and create
an occasion [Stoff] for action abroad.

§ 335
Furthermore, the state, as a wholly spiritual entity, cannot confine
itself simply to noting that an injury has actually taken place. On the
contrary, a further cause of discord arises in the idea [Vorstellung] of
such an injury as a danger threatening from another state, in changing
estimates of greater and lesser degrees of probability, in conjectures
as to the other state's intentions, etc.

The relationship of states to one another is a relationship between
independent entities and hence between particular wills, and it is on
this that the very validity of treaties depends. But the particular will of
the whole, as far as its content is concerned, is its own welfare in general.
Consequendy, this welfare is the supreme law for a state in its rela­
tions with others, especially since the Idea of the state is precisely that
the opposition between right as abstract freedom and the particular
content which fills it, i.e. the state's own welfare, should be super­
seded within it, and it is on this Idea as a corzcrete whole that the initial
recognition of states is based (see § 3 3 I).

Philosophy ofRight
§ 337
The substantial welfare o f the state is its welfare as a particular state in

its specific interest and condition and in its equally distinctive external
circumstances in conjunction with the particular treaties which gov­

not of universal providence (cf. Remarks to §

324), just as its end in

relation to other states and its principle for justifying wars and treaties

is not a universal (philanthropic) thought, but its actually offended or
threatened welfare in

its specific particularity.

There was at one time a great deal of talk about the opposition
between morality and politics and the demand that the latter
should conform to the former. I In the present context, we

of morality, the nature of the state, and the state's

The fact that states reciprocally recognize each other as such remains,

and contingency - a

[Rechtlosigkeit], force,
bOl1d whereby they retain their validity for each

other in their being in and for themselves, so that even in wartime, the
determination of war is that of something which ought to come to an
end. War accordingly entails the determination of international law

[Volkerrecllt]

that it should preserve the possibility of peacel - so that,

for example, ambassadors should be respected and war should on no
account be waged either on internal institutions and the peace of
private and family life, or on private individuals.

Addition (G). Modem wars are accordingly waged in a humane manner,

and persons do not confront each other in hatred. At most, personal
enmities will arise at military outposts, but in the army as such, hostility is
something indeterminate which takes second place to the duty which each
respects in the other.

§ 339
Otherwise, the conduct of states towards one another in wartime (e.g.
in the taking of prisoners), and concessions of rights in peacetime to
the citizens of another state for the purpose of private contacts, etc.
will depend primarily on national customs, for these are the universal
aspect of behaviour which is preserved under all circumstances.

Addition (G). The European nations [Nationerzj form a family with respect
to the universal principle of their legislation, customs, and culture
[Bildlmgj, so that their conduct in terms of international law is modified
accordingly in a situation which is otherwise dominated by the mutual
infliction of evils [ Ubeltzj. The relations between states are unstable, and
there is no praetor to settle disputes; the higher praetor is simply the
universal spirit which has being in and for itself, i.e. the world spirit.

Since states function as partiClllar entities in their mutual relations, the
broadest view of these relations will encompass the ceaseless turmoil
not just of external contingency, but also of passions, interests, ends,
talents and virtues, violence [Gewalt], wrongdoing, and vices in their
inner particularity. In this turmoil, the ethical whole itself - the
independence of the state - is exposed to contingency. The principles
of the spirits oj nations [Volksgeister] are in general of a limited nature
because of that particularity in which they have their objective actu­
ality and self-consciousness as existerzt individuals, and their deeds
and destinies in their mutual relations are the manifest [mcheinerzde]
dialectic of the finitude of these spirits. It is through this dialectic that
the univmal spirit, the spirit ojthe world, produces itself in its freedom
from all limits, and it is this spirit which exercises its right - which is
the highest right of all - over finite spirits in world history as the world's

Philosophy ofRight
C. World History

§ 34 I
The element of the universal spirit's existence [Dasein] is intuition and
image in art, feeling and representational thought in religion, and
pure and free thought in philosophy. In world history, it is spiritual
actuality in its entire range of inwardness and externality. World
history is a court of judgement [Gerie/lt] because, in its universality
which has being in and for itself, the particular - i.e. the Penates, civil
society, and the spirits of nations [Vulkergeister] in their multifarious
actuality - is present only as ideal, and the movement of spirit within
this element is the demonstration of this fact.

Furthermore, it is not just the power of spirit which passes judgement
in world history - i.e. it is not the abstract and irrational necessity of a
blind fate. On the contrary, since spirit in and for itself is reason, and
since the being-for-itself of reason in spirit is knowledge, world
history is the necessary development, from the concept of the freedom
of spirit alone, of the moments of reason and hence of spirit's self­
consciousness and freedom. It is the exposition and the actualization of

the universal spirit.

§ 343
The history of spirit is its own deed; for spirit is only what it does, and
its deed is to make itself - in this case as spirit - the object of its own
consciousness, and to comprehend itself in its interpretation of itself
to itself. This comprehension is its being and principle, and the
completion of an act of comprehension is at the same time its alienation
[EtltiitifJenmg] and transition. To put it in formal terms, the spirit
which comprehends this comprehension anew and which - and this
amounts to the same thing - returns into itself from its alienation, is
the spirit at a stage higher than that at which it stood in its earlier
[phase of] comprehension.
The question ofperftaibilityl and of the education

arises here.2 Those who have proclaimed this perfec­

tibility have had some inkling of the nature of spirit, which is

to have rv(irlh aWU1:6v" as the law of its

beillg,i

and, as it

comprehends what it is, to assume a higher shape than that in

which its being originally consisted. But for those who reject
this thought, spirit has remained an empty word, and history
has remained a superficial play of

cOlllillgmt

and allegedly

'merely human' aspirations and passions. Even if they at the
same time profess their faith in a higher power by references
to providmce and a providential plall, these remain empty ideas

[Vorstellzmgm], for they also declare explicitly that the plan of

providence is beyond their cognition and comprehension.
aTranslator's note: 'Know thyself'.

§ 344
The states, nations [Viilker], and individuals involved in this business
of the world spirit emerge with their own particular

alld delemzillate
prillciple, which has its interpretation and actuality in their c01zstituti01z
and throughout the whole extmt of their cOllditioll. In their conscious­

ness of this actuality and in their preoccupation with its interests, they
are at the same time the unconscious instruments and organs of that

inner activity in which the shapes which they themselves assume pass
away, while the spirit in and for itself prepares and works its way
towards the transition to its next and higher stage.

§ 345
Justice and virtue, wrongdoing, violence

[Gewalt],

and vice, talents

and their [expression in] deeds, the small passions and the great, guilt
and innocence,

the splendour of individual and national life

[Volkslebms], the independence, fortune, and misfortune of states and
individuals [der Eillzehzetz] - all of these have their determinate signifi­

cance and value in the sphere of conscious actuality, in which judge­

ment and justice - albeit imperfect justice - are meted out to them.
World history falls outside these points of view; in it, that necessary
moment of the Idea of the world spirit which constitutes
stage attains its

its current
absolute right, and the nation [Volk] which lives at this

Philosophy ofRight
point, and the deeds of that nation, achieve fulfilment, fortune, and
fame./

Since history is the process whereby the spirit assumes the shape of
events and of immediate natural actuality, the stages of its develop­
ment are present as immediate natural principles; and since these are
natural, they constitute a plurality of separate entities [eine Vielheit
aujJerei7lander] such that one of them is allotted to each nation [Volke] in
its geographical and amhropological existence [Existe7lz].

§ 347
The nation [Volk] to which such a moment is allotted as a 71atural
principle is given the task of implementing this principle in the course
of the self-development of the world spirit's self-consciousness. This
nation is the dominant one in world history for this epoch, and only once
in history can it have this epoch-making role (see § 3 46). In contrast with
this absolute right which it possesses as bearer of the present stage of
the world spirit's development, the spirits of other nations are without
rights, and they, like those whose epoch has passed, no longer count
in world history.
The particular history of a world-historical nation contains,
on the one hand, the development of its principle from its
latent [eingehiillte71] childhood phase until it blossoms out in
free ethical self-consciousness and makes its mark in univer­
sal history, and on the other, the period of its decline and fall
- for these denote the emergence within it of a higher
principle which is simply the negative of its own./ This signi­
fies the spirit's transition to the higher principle and hence the
transition of world history to another nation. From this period
onwards, the previous nation has lost its absolute interest, and
although it will also positively absorb the higher principle and
incorporate it in its own development, it will react to it as to an
extraneous element rather than with immanent vitality and
vigour. It will perhaps lose its independence, or it may survive
or eke out its existence as a particular state or group of states
374

I "-

§ § 3 45 -3 49

and struggle on in a contingent manner with all kinds of
internal experiments and external conflicts.

At the forefront of all actions, including world-historical actions, are
individuals as the subjectivities by which the substantial is actualized
(see Remarks to § 279).1 Since these individuals are the living expres­
sions of the substantial deed of the world spirit and are thus immedi­
ately identical with it, they cannot themselves perceive it and it is not
their object [Objekt] and end (see § 344). They receive no honour or
thanks on its account, either from their contemporaries (see § 3 44) or
from the public opinion of subsequent generations; all that they are
accorded by this opinion is undying fome [in their role] as formal
subjectivities.2

§ 349
In its initial stage, a nation [Volk] is not a state, and the transition of a
family, tribe, kinship group, mass [of people], etc. to the condition of a
state constitutes the fimnal realization of the Idea in ge@al within it.
If the nation, as ethi�bstance - and this is what it is in itself- does
not have this form, it lacks the objectivity ofpossessing a universal and
universally valid existence [Dasein] for itself and others in [the shape
of] laws as determinations of thought, and is therefore not recognized;
since its independence has no objective legality or firmly established
rationality for itself, it is merely formal and does not amount to
sovereignty.
Even in the context of ordinary ideas [Vor.stelltmg], we do not
describe a patriarchal condition as a constitution, nor do we
describe a people living in this condition as a state, or its
independence as sovereignty. Consequently, the actual begin­
ning of history is preceded on the one hand by dull innocence
which lacks all interest, and on the other by the valour of the
formal struggle for recognition and revenge (cf. § 33 I and
Remarks to § 57).

375

-

Philosophy ofRight

It is the absolute right of the Idea to make its appearance in legal
determinations and objective institutions, beginning with marriage
and agriculture (see Remarks to § 203), whether the form in which it
is actualized appears as divine legislation of a beneficial kind, or as
violence [Cwalt] and wrong. This right is the right of heroes to
establish states.I

The same determination entitles civilized nations [Nationen] to regard
and treat as barbarians other nations which are less advanced than
they are in the substantial moments of the state (as with pastoralists in
relation to hunters, and agriculturalists in relation to both of these), in
the consciousness that the rights of these other nations are not equal
to theirs and that their independence is merely formal.
Consequently, in the wars and conflicts which arise in these
circumstances, the feature which lends them significance for
world history is the fact [Moment] that they are struggles for
recognition with reference to a specific content [Cehalt].

The concrete Ideas of national spirits [Volkergeister] have their truth
and destiny [Bestimmlmg] in the concrete Idea as absolute universality,
�
i.e. in the world spirit, around whose throne they stand as the agents
of its actualization and as witnesses and ornaments of its splendour.
As spirit, it is simply the movement of its own activity in gaining
absolute knowledge of itself and thereby freeing its consciousness
from the form o� and so coming to itself. The
prirlciples behind the configurations [Cestaltullgen] which this self­
consciousness assumes in the course of its liberation - i.e. the world­
historical realms - are accordingly four in number.

§ 353
In its first and immediate revelation, the spirit has as its principle the
shape of the substantial spirit as the identity in which individuality

Ethical Life

§ § 3 5 0-3 55

[Einzelheit] is submerged in its essence, and in which it does not yet
have legitimacy for itself.
The second principle i s knowledge on the part o f this substantial
spirit, so that the latter becomes a positive content and fulfilment of
spirit and its being-for itselfas its own livingflnn - i.e. beautifitl ethical
individuality [Individualitiit].
The third principle is the self-absorption of this knowing being­
for-itself to the point o(.abstract universality; it thereby becomes the
infinite opposite of the objective world which has at the same time
likewise been abandoned by the spirit.
The principle of the fourth configuration [Gestalttl1zg] is the trans­
formation of this spiritual opposition in such a way that the spirit
attains its truth and concrete essence in its own inwardness, and
becomes at home in and reconciled with the objective world; and
since this spirit, having reverted to its original substantiality, is the
spirit which has retunzedfrom infinite opposition, it produces and knows
its own truth as thought and as a world of legal actuality.

§ 354
In accordance with these four principles, the world-historical realms
are four in number: 1 . the Oriental, 2 . the Greek, 3 . the Roman, 4.
the Germanic.

§ 355
1 . The Oriental Realm
The world-view of this first realm is inwardly undivided and substan­
tial, and it originates in the natural whole of patriarchal society.
According to this view, the secular government is a theocracy, the
ruler is also a high priest or a god, the constitution and legislation are
at the same time religion, and religious and moral commandments or rather usages - are also laws of right and of the state. Within this
magnificent whole, the individual personality has no rights and disap­
pears altogether, external nature is immediately divine or an adorn­
ment of the god, and the history of the actual world is poetry. The
distinctions which develop between the various aspects of customs,
government, and the state take the place of laws, and even where
customs are simple, these distinctions become ponderous, elaborate,

377

Philosophy ofRight
and superstitious ceremonies - the accidents [ZuJiilligkeiten] of per­
sonal power and arbitrary rule - and the divisions of social estates
harden into a natural system of castes. Consequently, the Oriental
state lives only in its movement, and since nothing in it is stable and
what is firmly established is fossilized, this movement turns outwards
and becomes an elemental rage and devastation. The inner calm [of
such a state] is that of private life and of submersion in weakness and
exhaustion.
The moment in the state's development [Staatsbildung] at
which spirituality is still substantial and nalllral constitutes, as a
fonn, the absolute beginning of every state's history. This has
been emphasized and demonstrated with learning and pro­
found perception, and with reference to the history of particu­
lar states, by Dr Stuhr in his work The Downfoll of Natural
States (Berlin, 1 8 1 2), which has cleared the way for a rational
view of constitutional history and of history in generaJ.i The
author has likewise shown that the principle of subjectivity
and self-conscious freedom is present in the Germanic
nation; but since his treatise goes no further than the downfall
of natural states, this principle is followed only up to the point
where it either appears as restless mobility, human arbitrari­
ness, and corruption, or assumes the particular shape of emo­
tion without having developed to the objectivity of self-conscious
substantiality or to organized legality.

2. The Greek Realm
In this realm, the substantial unity of the finite and the infinite is
present, but only as a mysterious substratum, banished as a dim
recollection into the recesses [HoMen]" and images of tradition.
Reborn from the self-differentiating spirit into individual spirituality
and the daylight of knowledge, this substratum is modified and
transfigured to become beauty and a free and serene ethical life.
Within this determination, the principle of personal individuality
accordingly emerges, though it is not yet engrossed in itself [itz sidz
selbst befil1lgen] but still retains its ideal unity. Consequently, the whole
aTranslator's note: Literally 'caves'.

Ethical Life
splits up into a series of particular national spirits [Volksgeister], and on
the one hand, the ultimate decision of the will is not yet assigned to
the subjectivity of self-consciousness which has being for itself, but to
a power which stands above and outside it (see Remarks to § 279),
while on the other, the particularity associated with needs has not yet
, become part of [the realm of] freedom, but is confined to a class of
/
/ slaves [Sklavenstand].

§ 357
3 . The Roman Realm
In this realm, [the process of] differentiation comes to an end with the
infinite diremption [Ze1Teiflung] of ethical life into the extremes of
personal or private self-consciousness and abstract universality. This
opposition, which begins with a collision between the substantial
intuition of an aristocracy and the principle of free personality in
democratic form, develops into superstition and the assertion of cold
�nd acquisitive power on the one hand, and into a corrupt rabble on
the other. The dissolution of the whole ends in universal misfortune
nd the demise of ethical life, in which the individualities of nations
/ � Viilker] perish in the unity of a pantheon, and all individuals
[Einzelnen] sink to the level of private persons with an equal status and
with formal rights, who are accordingly held together only by an
abstract and arbitrary will of increasingly monstrous proportions.

f.

4. The Germanic Realm
Having suffered this loss of itself and its world and the infinite pain
which this entails (and for which a particular people, namely the
Jews, ! was held in readiness), the spirit is pressed back upon itself at
the extreme of its absolute negativity. This is the turning point which
has being in and for itself. The spirit now grasps the infinite positivity
of its own inwardness, the principle of the unity of divine and human
nature and the reconciliation of the objective truth and freedom
which have appeared within self-consciousness and subjectivity. The
task of accomplishing this reconciliation is assigned to the Nordic
principle of the Gemlatlic peoples.2

379

Philosophy ofRight
§ 3 59
The inwardness of this principle is the - as yet abstract - reconcili­
ation and resolution of all opposition, and it exists in feeling
[Empfindwlg] as faith, love, and hope. It reveals its content in order to
raise it to actuality and self-conscious rationality, to [make it into] a
secular realm based on the emotions, loyalty, and companionship of
free individuals - although it is also, in this subjectivity, a realm of
ethical barbarism and of crude arbitrariness which has being for itself.
This stands in opposition to an otherworldly and intellectual realm
whose content, although it is indeed the truth of the spirit within it,
has not yet been thought and is therefore still veiled in the barbarism
of representational thinking; as a spiritual power set over the actual
emotions, this realm adopts the role of an unfree and terrible force in
relation to these. I

In the hard struggle between these two realms - whose difference has
now reached the stage of absolute opposition, despite the fact that
both are rooted in a single unity and Idea - the spiritual realm brings
the existence [Existenz] of its heaven down to earth in this world/ to
the ordinary secularity of actuality and representational thought. The
secular realm, on the other hand, devel�r-itself
to the level of thought and to the principle of rational being and
knowing, i.e. to the rationality of right and law. As a result, their
opposition has faded away in itselfand become an insubstantial shape.
The present has cast off its barbarism and unjust [unrechtliche]
arbitrariness, and truth has cast off its otherworldliness and con­
tingent force, so that the true reconciliation, which reveals the state as
the image and actuality of reason, has become objective. In the state,
the self-consciousness finds the actuality of its substantial knowledge
and volition in organic development; in religion, it finds the feeling and
representation [Vorstelltmg] of this truth as ideal essentiality; but in
science, it finds the free and comprehended cognition of this truth as
one and the same in all its complementary manifestations, i.e. in the
state, in nature, and in the ideal world.

ably had completed a manuscript version of P R, which the sudden
imposition of censorship (see note 1 8 below) caused him to with­

draw and revise.

barely begun this series of lectures on P R when he was stricken
with cholera and died on 1 4 November 1 83 1 .)

Throughout most of the 1 820S, Hegel preferred not to lecture on P R
himself, leaving this task to his younger colleague Eduard Gans
(1 798-I839). The transcriptions by Hotho (1822-I823) and
Griesheim (1824-1 825) were used by Gans as the basis for the
'Additions' to P R, first published with the I 833 edition; cf. Eduard

Klett-Cotta, r98r).
Hegel first published his Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Scie1/ces in
Heidelberg in r 8 17. The topics dealt with in P R are covered (but
much more briefly and sketchily) under the heading of 'Objective
Spirit' (EH §§ 4°0-452). This discussion is expanded in subsequent
u-volume) editions of the Encyclopaedia (second edition r 827, third
edition r 830) (E G § § 483-552).
Penelope, wife of Odysseus, promised the suitors who beset her in
her husband's long absence from Ithaca that she would marry one of
them as soon as she completed weaving a shroud for her father-in­
law, Laertes. But each night she secretly undid the day's weaving, so
that the task would never be completed (Homer, Odyssey
1 9· 137-r55)·
Hegel regards the 'speculative mode of cognition' as the distinguish­
ing mark of his philosophy. His fullest introductory exposition of the
differences between speculation and other philosophical approaches
is to be found in the introduction which he later wrote for his
Encyclopaedia in 1 827 (E L §§ r-83).
Hegel's best brief exposition of his speculative method before r 820 is
to be found in the Prefaces and Introduction of TIle Scie1/ce ofLogic
(WL v, 1 3-56125-59).
Cf. Jacob Friedrich Fries (1773-1 843):
To us Germans the splendour of the virtues of patriotism and
piety has recently appeared in our life, and their significance for
the life of every individual has become clearer. May the German
people grow stronger in the healthy spirit of the virtues of public
life: so we will and believe! For this great work I think I can do my
part by further developing the scientific presentation of ethical
truths in the German language.
(Fries, H P P vi)
Hegel and Fries were long-time personal rivals. Both held the posi­
tion of Privatdozent at the University of Jena from 1801 to 1 8°5,
when Fries was promoted to professor of philosophy at the University
of Heidelberg. Hegel bitterly resented Fries's advancement, and Fries
continued to do everything he could to hinder Hegel's career. In 1 8 1 I
Hegel wrote the following to his friend Niethammer:
I have known Fries for a long time. I know that he has gone
beyond the Kantian philosophy by interpreting it in the most
superficial manner, by earnestly watering it down ever more,
making it ever more superficial . . . The first volume [of Fries's

Notes to pages II-IS
System of Logic] is spiridess, completely superficial, threadbare,
trivial, devoid of the least intimation of scientific coherence. The
explanations [in the second volume] are . . . the most slovenly
disconnected explanatory lecture-hall twaddle, such as only a
truly empty-headed individual in his hour of digestion could
come up with. I prefer to say nothing more specific about his
miserable thoughts.
(B I, 33 8-33 91257)
Fries remained professor in Heidelberg for eleven years; during most
of this time Hegel languished as headmaster of a Nuremberg
gymnasium (secondary school). When Fries moved to a professorship
at Jena in 1 8 16, Hegel returned to university life by becoming his
successor. In 1 8 1 8, however, Hegel was promoted to the prestigious
chair of philosophy at Berlin. In 1820, as part of the so-called 'dema­
gogue persecutions' (carried out by the newly ascendant reactionaries
in the Prussian government (see note 1 8 below» Fries was deprived
of his professorship at Jena for his participation in the Wartburg
Festival (see notes I I-1 2 below). (The professorship was restored to
Fries in 1824.)
In 1 8 19, several of Hegel's students and assistants (including
Gustav Asverus (1 798-1843 ), Friedrich Wilhelm Carove (1 78g1 852), Friedrich Christoph Forster (179 1-1868), and Leopold von
Henning (1791-1 866» were subject to these same persecutions.
Hegel intervened on their behalf, not always with success (he put up
500 imperial dollars - nearly three months' pay - as bail for Asverus,
who was nevertheless not released until 1826). Hegel had some
reason to fear both for his own position and for the fate of P R in the
hands of the censorship. In the Preface of P R, Hegel wants to
reassure the censors that his philosophy of the state contains nothing
dangerous or subversive; Hegel's unattractive perpetuation of his old
vendetta against a victim of political persecution is thus also being
used to serve the end of self-protection.
7 Cf. Luke 16:29·
8 In this passage, Hegel once again has mainly Fries in mind. Fries's
D B S was dedicated 'To Germany's Youth' (D B S 3 ).

�.

Religious convictions of the holy origin of all things, of the
existence of God and eternal life, should not be scientifically
supported and proved, nor should they be applied scientifically as
principles of proof; rather, they are properly the immediate
fundamental thoughts of those living feelings of presentiment
(Almdlmg) which recognize eternal truth through inspiration and
devotion to the beauty of natural appearances and above all to the
(Fries, H P P 6-7)
spiritual beauty of human life.

Notes to page 15
More generally, he probably intends to refer to the anti-rationalistic
philosophy of the Romantics, and especially those influenced by
Christetldom or Europe (1 799) (often attributed to Friedrich von
Hardenberg ('Novalis') (1772-1801)), and by the later political
thought ofJohann Gottlieb Fichte (1 762-1 8 1 4), such as his posthu­
mously published TheoT)' of the State (1 813). See Reinhold Aris,
History of Political 17zought itl GermatlY I78g-18rS (London: Allen &
Unwin, 1 936), especially Chapters 6-1 2; and H. S. Reiss (ed.), The
Political Thought of the Germall Romalltics (Oxford: Blackwell,
1 955)·
9 Cf. Psalms 1 27:2: 'It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to
eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.' A literal
translation of Luther's German version of the last clause (which
Hegel typically quotes imperfectly, from memory) would be: 'To his
friends he gives it [bread] in sleep.'
10 Compare the following footnote from Hegel's Sciellce ofLogic:
The latest treatment of [the science oflogic] which has recently
appeared, the System ofLogic by Fries, reverts to anthropological
foundations. The superficiality of the notion (Vorstelltmg) or
opinion on which it is based, both in and for itself and in its
execution, relieves me of the trouble of taking any notice
(WL v, 47/52)
whatever of this insignificant publication.

t

Fries tried to prevent the first volume of Hegel's Sciellce of Logic
(containing this footnote) from being reviewed at all; finally, he
reviewed it himself in 1 8 14 at greater length than Hegel's co ment
just quoted, but with no greater respect (cf. B II, 38 1-382).
I I Hegel is referring to the Wartburg Festival of October 1 8 1 7 . / n 1 8
and 1 9 October, the student fraternities (Burschetlschafietl) held a
festival at the Wartburg, in the town of Eisenach, to celebrate both the
tricentennial of the Lutheran Reformation and the fourth anniversary
of the victory over Napoleonic troops at the Battle of Leipzig. About
five hundred students from about a dozen universities took part, as
did a few of their professorial mentors. Prominent among the latter
were Lorenz Oken (1 779-1 85 1) and Fries. The festival was one of
the earliest expressions of 'student dissent' in the German universi­
ties. It founded a 'General German Student Fraternity' whose
'Principles' favoured German unity, national representation and con­
stitutional goverrunent, opposing feudal social organization and the
police state. Their spirit was an emotional combination (not always
coherent) of the ideals of the French Revolution \vith German
nationalism, Romantic organicism and Christian piety. At the end of
the first day, there was a burning of 'un-German' books, including the

Notes to pages 15-16
Napoleonic Code, the Prussian Police Laws, and the writings of
reactionaries such as Karl Ludwig von Haller (1 768-1854) (see note
15 below) and August von Kotzebue (1761-1 8 1 9) (see note 1 8
below). See Thomas Nipperdey, Deutsche Geschichte 1800-1866
(Munich: C. H. Beck, 1 983), p. 280.
The German authorities perceived the Wartburg Festival as a
direct threat to them. Hegel's reference here to the 'notorious' Wart­
burg Festival is apparently hostile. But on closer inspection we see
that it is his enemy Fries who absorbs all the hostility. Hegel was
himself a professorial sponsor of the BurscllellSchafiell both in
Heidelberg and Berlin. Though he was not present at the Wartburg
Festival, he had numerous ties to those who were. He was a close
friend of Oken, and several of his students were active in the Bur­
scllellschaftell, as were Hegel's brother-in-law, Gottlieb von Tiicher,
and also Robert and Wilhelm Wesselh6ft, with whose family Hegel's
illegitimate son lived for some time (see Jacques d'Hondt, Hegel ill His
Time, tr. J. Burbidge (Lewiston, NY: Broadview, 1 988), pp. I I31 1 4). Hegel's publisher and friend Karl Friedrich Ernst Frommann
(1 765-1837) had a son who was also present at the festival, and
published a glowing account of the proceedings (Friedrich Johannes
Frommann, Das Burscllellfist au!der Wartburg Gena: Friedrich From­
mann, 1 8 1 8» .
Carove spoke prominently at the Wartburg Festival and was
founder of the 'General German Student Fraternity'. (Hegel later
tried to have Carove appointed his assistant at Berlin, but failed owing
to Carove's unacceptable political activities.) Within the German
student movement, Hegel and Fries represent conflicting tendencies.
Fries is a republican, and a proponent of German unity and German
nationalism. Hegel is a supporter of constitutional monarchy (cf. P R
§§ 273, 278R) and representative institutions (cf. P R §§ 302-3 1 4),
and a consistent opponent of feudal institutions (cf. P R § § 46, 62R,
64, 75R, 172A, 1 80R, 273R, 278R, 286R). He attacks the reactionary
Haller (cf. P R § § 258R) but admires the Prussian and Napoleonic
Codes (cf. PR §§ 2 1 1 ,R, 2 16, 258R; VPRI9 172). Hegel's attitude
toward German nationalism and German unity is less than
enthusiastic: as a south German from the Duchy of Wiirttemberg
with indigenous traditions of representative government, he is wary of
the absorption of the smaller German states into a 'German nation'
(cf. PR § 3 22R and note I); Hegel's contemptuous pun on the
German nationalist watchword Delltschtttm (Teutonism') is Delltsch­
dumm ('German stupidity') (B II, 43/3 1 2).
1 2 Hegel is apparently referring to the follmving remarks from Fries's
speech:

Notes to page [6
But if the spirit of a people were to attain to a genuinely
common spirit, then justice, chastity and self-sacrificing patriot­
ism would rule in this people; then life in this people would come
from beneath, from the people, in every business of public con­
cern. Not only the form of law and authority, not only the private
compulsion of official duty, but also the spirit of subordination
would drive the individual; the desire for knowledge and the
striving of the student would drive the teacher to enthusiasm, the
spirit of the people would drive the judge to justice. And in this
people living societies would dedicate themselves to every
individual work of popular education and service of the people,
unbreakably united through the holy chain of friendship.
(Fries, F D B; cf. H P P 328-329)
Hegel's attacks on Fries have often been cited as evidence of his
'conservatism', in opposition to Fries's 'liberalism'. Hegel's
defenders, in response, have often contrasted Hegel's defence of
equal civil rights for Jews (PR § § 209R, 270R) with Fries's vicious
anti-Semitism (Walter Kaufmann, 'The Hegel Myth and Its
Method', in Kaufmann (ed.) Hegel's Political Philosophy (New York:
Atherton, 1970), pp. 145-147; see P R § 270, note 6). Nevertheless,
whatever it may do to our moral sensibilities, anti-Sernitism (or lack of
it) is not, in this period, a reliable barometer of a person's general
political position. More to the point is the judgement of the French
liberal Victor Cousin (1 792-1867):
In politics, M. Hegel is the only man from Germany with
whom I was always on the best of terms. He was, like me, infused
with the new spirit; he considered the French Revolution to be
the gxeatest step forward taken by humankind since Christianity
and he never ceased questioning me about the issues and men of
this gxeat epoch. He was profoundly liberal without being the
least bit republican.
(Victor Cousin, 'Souvenirs d'Allemagne', Revile des dellx lIIolldes,
August 1 866, pp. 6 1 6-617)
In the Preface to P R, Hegel emphasizes his (quite real) philosophical
differences with Fries, but probably gives the impression of a much
gxeater disagxeement between them on political issues than really
exists. For instance, Hegel quotes \vith apparent disapproval Fries's
opinion that public business should gain its life 'from below', but
Hegel himself asserts that 'civil life should be governed in a COllcrete
manner from below, where it is concrete' (PR § 290). Fries, like
Hegel, favours 'gxadual change of the constitution' (Fries, D B S 1,

Notes to pages 16-17
1 65) as a way of realizing the modem spirit without the terrible effects
of the French Revolution (toward which Fries's attitude, unlike
Hegel's, is unreservedly hostile) (Fries, D B S I, 41-56); both men
advocate a constitutional government with Estates assemblies with
representatives of both the nobility and the bourgeoisie (cf. P R
§§ 289-3 20 and Fries, D B S I , 1 46-162). Philosophical differences
cannot fully account for Hegel's attitude toward Fries; Hegel was on
good terms with the aging F. H. Jacobi (1743- 1 8 1 9), whose
philosophical position was in many ways quite close to Fries's. The
differences between Hegel and Fries were more philosophical than
political, but more personal than philosophical.
13 The Greek philosopher Epicurus (c. 341-271 B.C.) believed that
nothing exists in nature except atoms and the void, but he tried to
reconcile this with incompatibilist-indeterminist views about freedom
of the will, which led him to postulate a degree of randOInness in
nature. His extant writings do not contain the doctrine articulated by
the Roman Epicurean Lucretius (c. 99-55 B.C.) that in their motion
atoms swerve randomly into parallel paths, but this doctrine is widely
enough attributed to Epicurus himself to make it probable that he
held it. Hegel may also have in mind Epicurus' denial of any natural
teleology. Cf. A. A. Long and D. N. Sedley, The Hellenistic Philo­
sophers I (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), pp. 52, 57,
72, 102-I I 2.
14 Hegel's quotation from Goethe, which contains minor inaccuracies,
runs together several lines of Mephistopheles' speech: Faust, Part I,
lines 1 85 1-1855:
Do but despise reason and science
Highest of all the human powers,
Let yourself, through magic and delusion,
Grow strong through the spirit of deception,
Then it's certain I will get you!
and lines 1 866-1 867:
And even if he hadn't given himself over to the devil
He would perish just the same!
Goethe, Werke III, ed. Erich Trunz (Munich: Beck, 1982), p. 6 1
The same passage was (rnis)quoted b y Hegel a t Ph G � 360.
15 Cf. PR § 258R. The remark was made, however, in the course of
criticizing the views of the reactionary Romantic Karl Ludwig von
Haller (1768-1854), whose Restoration ofPolitical Science, or TIleoT), of

the Natural-Social Condition, Opposed to the Chimaera of the Artificial­
Civil Condition (Winterthur: Steiner, 1 8 1 6-1 820) was one of the

Notes to pages I7-I9
books burnt at the Wartburg Festival (see P R § 258, note 3). Hegel's
defenders sometimes point to this as an example of Hegel's even­
handedness balancing his attack on the liberal Fries with an attack
on the conservative Haller. But there is something craftier than even­
handedness going on here. Hegel is trying to portray his scathing
critique of the authoritarian reactionary Haller (who, at the time the
Preface was written, was still something of a favourite at the Prussian
court) as if it were a rejection of Fries's views. (The favourable
attitude of the Prussian reactionaries toward Haller changed suddenly
in 1 8 2 1 when it was revealed to them that Haller had secredy con­
verted to Roman Catholicism, on the ground that he had come to
regard the spirit of the Lutheran Reformation as leading inevitably to
the French Revolution, from which he felt he must distance himself
as far as possible.)

1 7 'Wer ein Amt erh1ilt im Land, der erh1ilt auch den Verstand'
('Whoever receives an office in the land, also receives understanding')

Recht illl Spiegel deutsclzer Spriclzworter (Leipzig: Quelle & Meyer,

Hegel's use of it here.
1 8 This refers to the Carlsbad Decrees of 1 8 1 9 and to the consequent
censorship to which publications like P R had recendy become sub­
ject. The decrees were a prominent part of a movement of political
reaction which took place quite suddenly in the summer of 1 8 19.
After the defeat of Prussia at the hands of Napoleon in 1 808, an era of
reform had been initiated by Heinrich Karl vom Stein (1757-1 83 1).
It achieved the abolition of serfdom, administrative reorganization of
the government and the army, and the partial emancipation of a
capitalist economy from feudal and guild encumbrances. Stein's
idealism, refusal to compromise, and unbending nationalistic hostility
to Napoleon led to his dismissal in 1 8 1 0. But many of his reforms,
which (despite his attitude toward Napoleon) imitated French exam­
ples, were continued after 1 8 I ! by Karl August von Hardenberg

(1 750-1 822).
On 23 March 1 8 1 9, the reactionary poet August von Kotzebue
(176 1-1 8 1 9) was assassinated by a student, Karl Ludwig Sand
(1 795-1 820), who believed (very likely correcdy) that Kotzebue was a
Russian (Tsarist) agent. Sand was an associate of Karl Follen (1 7951 840), a student of Fries, who advocated a 'theory of individual

terror', according to which such an assassination was a noble deed, if
carried out from political motives, 'a war of individuals, a war of one
individual against another' (K. G. Faber, 'Student und Politik in der
ersten deutschen Burschenschaft', Gescllichte ill Wissellscllaft rmd
Vllterricllt 2 1 (1970); cf. Karl Alexander von Milller, Karl Ludwig
Salld (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1 925), and Richard Preziger, Die politi­
sche1/ Idem des Karl Folletl (Tiibingen: Mohr, � 9 1 2» .
The murder of Kotzebue became a cause dlebre for Prussian reac­
tionaries, who used it as a rallying point for the nobility's reaction
against the entire reform movement. It was equally an opportunity for
Mettemich and the forces of continental reaction outside Prussia,
who looked askance at the liberal direction in which affairs were
moving there. In August 1 8 19, a meeting of continental powers was
convened in Carlsbad (now in Czechoslovakia), resulting in the Carls­
bad Decfees� which resolved on the institution, throughout the states
belonging to the federation there convened, of statutes providing for
the dismissal of all university teachers deemed to have 'an influence
on the minds of the young through the propagation of corrupt doc­
trines, hostile to public order and peace or subversive of the principles
of the existing political institutions'; imposed censorship on
academics and academic publications; and established a commission
for the investigation of 'revolutionary activities and demagogical
associations' (quoted in Theodor Schieder, Vom deutscl/etl Brmd zum
deutsclletl Reich IBrS-I871 (Stuttgart: Klett, 1970), pp. 30-3 I). Hegel
had completed a draft of P R, but withdrew and revised it in the light
of these new circumstances. As we have already seen, the Preface in
particular is designed to quiet any possible suspicions the censors
might have concerning Hegel's political opinions.
Johannes von Miiller, Siimmtliche Werke XXXII, ed. Johann Georg Miil­
ler (Stuttgart and Tiibingen: J. G. Cotta, 1 83 5), p. 240. Johannes von
Milller (1752-r 809) was a Swiss historian and diplomat, political
progressive and associate of Goethe, Schiller and Herder. He served
the Elector of Mainz, Joseph II of Austria and, in his last years,
Napoleon Bonaparte. The quoted remark is from a graphic descrip­
tion of the dismal and demoralized conditions prevailing in Rome
under French occupation.
Cf. Ph G � 482; V P G 3 80-385/3 1 4-3 1 8.
Hegel is apparendy referring to the passage two paragraphs earlier,
where he claimed that in the modem world philosophy has a public
existence, in contrast to its existence as a private art among the
Greeks.
In his later expositions of this famous (or infamous) saying, Hegel is at

Notes to pages 2D-21
pains to point out that it does 1/01 mean that everything is as it ought to
be, or (more particularly) that the existing political order is always
rational:
But if I have spoken of acttlality, then it is self-evident that you
are to think of the sense in which I use this expression, since I
have treated of actuality in a worked-out Logic, distinguishing it
precisely not only from the contingent, which has existence, but
also from [two senses of] existence (ExisII?11Z, Daseill) and other
determinations . . . When [the understanding] with its 'ought'
turns to trivial, external and transitory objects, institutions, condi­
tions, etc., which perhaps may have a great relative actuality for a
certain time and in a certain sphere, it may be right and in such
cases it may find much which does not correspond to universally
correct determinations. For who is not clever enough to see much
in his environment which is not in fact as it ought to be? But this
cleverness is wrong to imagine that such objects and their 'ought'
have any place within the interests of philosophical science. For
science has to do only with the Idea, which is not so impotent that
it only ought to be without actually being; hence philosophy has to
do \vith an actuality of which those objects, institutions, condi­
tions, etc. are only .the superficial exterior.
(EL § 6; for Hegel's discussion of 'actuality' in his logic see EL
§ § 142-147 and WL VI , 1 86-2 1 3/541-550; c f. also VGP II,
r rQ-I I 1/95-<)6 and VPR IV, 923-<)24)
Far from hallowing the status quo, Hegel's formulations of the ration­
ality of the actual in his lectures of 1 8 1 7-1 820 emphasize the dynamic
and progressive aspect of the reason which is at work actualizing itself
in the world: 'What is actual becomes rational, and the rational
becomes actual' (VPR19 5 1); 'What is rational must happen, since on
the whole the constitution is only its development' (VPR 1 7 1 57); cf.
also P R § 258A.

24 'Here is Rhodes, jump here.' This saying is drawn from one of
Aesop's fables:
An

The Braggart

athlete who had always been criticized by his fellow
townsmen for not being much of a man once went away and came
back after a rime boasting that besides performing many feats of
valour in other cities, at Rhodes he had made such a jump that
none of the Olympic victors could equal it. Moreover, he claimed
that he would offer people who were there as witnesses if any of
390

them ever came to town. One of the bystanders spoke up and said
to him, 'Well, my friend, if what you say is true, you don't need
any witnesses. Here is Rhodes, [jump here].'
(Lloyd W. Daly (tr.), Aesop Without Morals (New York: Thomas
Yoseloff, 1 96 1), p. 107)

25 Hegel now apparendy means: to leap over the city of Rhodes, or over
its harbour, which was straddled by the Colossus of Rhodes, a huge
statue of Apollo erected about 300 B.C. after Rhodes had withstood
siege by the navy of Antigonus I, King of Macedonia.
26 In Greek, Rhodos means either 'Rhodes' or 'rose', and in Latin, salta
means either 'jump' or 'dance'. The pun suggests to Hegel that to
meet the challenge of comprehending the rationality of the actual is
also to find a way of rejoicing in the present.
27 Compare the following from Hegel's hand-written lecture notes:
'The present appears to reflection, and especially to self-conceit, as a
cross (indeed, of necessity) - and philosophy teaches [us] to recognize
the rose - i.e. reason - in this cross' (VP R n, 89, cf. also VR I,
2721I, 284-285). The image of the rose in the cross was apparendy
suggested to Hegel by the name (and the visual emblem) of the
'Rosicrucians', the secret religious society, apparendy begun in the
seventeenth century, and prominendy represented by Michael Maier
(1568-1622) and Robert Fludd (1 574-1637). The name 'Rosicru­
cian' was based on that of the (alleged) founder of the society,
Christian Rosencreutz (fourteenth century). But the name itself also
has doctrinal significance for Rosicrucians, associated with their pro­
verb 'No cross, no crown': i.e., one reaches the 'rose' (the divine),
only through the 'cross' (earthly suffering) (see Harry Wells Fogarty,
'Rosicrucians', TIle Ellcyclopedia o/Religioll XII (New York: Macmillan,
1 987), pp. 476-477)·
28 'A little taste of philosophy perhaps moves one to atheism, but more
of it leads back to religion' (Francis Bacon, The Advatlcement o/Learn­
illg, Works I, ed. Spedding, Ellis, and Heath (London: Longman,
1 857-1874), p. 436; cf. TIle Essayes or Coullsels, Civil! alld Moral!, ed.
Michael Kiernan (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Press, 1985), Number
1 6: 'Of Atheisme', p. 5 1).
29 'So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will
spue thee out of my mouth' (Revelation 3 : 1 6).
30 Compare also the following, from Hegel's lectures of 1 8 1 9-1820:
The modem age has determined what is in itself rational and
perfect through thought, and simultaneously removed the cloak
of dust and rust from the positive. This is nothing but the
fundamental principle of philosophy, of the free cognition of
391

Notes to pages 23-27
truth, no longer cloaked by contingency. The age has at present
nothing to do except to cognize what is at hand, and thus to make
it accord with thought. This is the path of philosophy.
(VP RI9 290)
3 I The owl is the sacred bird of Minerva (Greek: Athena), goddess of
wisdom. The apparent meaning of this famous saying is that a
culture's philosophical understanding reaches its peak only when the
culture enters its decline (cf. VG 66/5 8, I 78-I 80h45-I47).

)ll/

§I
I Ordinary thinking identifies a 'concept' (Begriff) with something
general abstracted from particulars. Hegel's name for this is a
� (Vorstelltmg) or 'dete . ation of the ersta ing'.
For Hegel, the �concel?t' is 'the fTI<.e ', 'the principle of life and so at
the same time the absolutely concrete' (EL § I 60,A); 'the concept, in
so far as it has attained to a �ped] existence [Existettz] which is
free, is nothing other than the "I" or pure self-consciousness' (WL
VI, 2531583). The concept strives to give itself actual objective
existence, and then it is called the 'Idea' (Idee): 'the Idea is the
adequate concept' (WL VI, 462/755), 'the Idea is the true in and for
itself, the absolute unity of the concept and objectivity' (E L § 2 13).

I The development or ' roof of the conce t of ri h was given in the
Encyclopaedia (cf. E G § § 485-487). P R is an expansion of the part of
Hegel's system presentedrnEG § § 488-552.
2 The thesis that philosophy forms a circle seems to lie behind Hegel's
choice of the title 'Encyclopaedia' for the complete exposition of his
system (E L §§ 1 5-18).
3 'In civil law all definitions are hazardous' Gustinian, Digest 50. 17.202;
see PR § 3, note 2). The proposition is usually attributed to the
Roman jurist Iavolenus, first century A.D.
4 The phrase 'facts of consciousness' recalls Fichte's The Facts of COI1sciollsness ( 1 8 1 3) (FW II, 537-691), but Hegel's remarks seem to be
aimed especially at Fries's psychologizing of Kantian transcendental
philosophy:
Kant comInitted the great mistake of holding transcendental
cognition to be a kind of a priori cognition, and he thus missed its
392

Notes to pages 27-29
empirical psychological nature. This mistake is an unavoidable
consequence of the other one, which we have already reproved,
of confusing a philosophical deduction with a kind of proof,
which he called a transcendental proof.
(Fries, AKV, Introduction, I, 29; cf. H P P 367-370; cf. Hegel,
V G P III, 41 8-419/5 10-5 I I)
In the mid- I790S, the phrase 'facts of consciousness' was also closely
associated with the Kantian epistemological theories of the Jena
philosopher Christian Erhard Schmid (1761-1 8 1 2), who was the
object of a contemptuous attack by Fichte (FW II, 42 1-458). (See
Preface, notes 7, 9-I I , 18.)

2 The Institutes and Pandects (Latin title: Digest) were the first two of
four parts of the legal code (later given the collective name Corpus iuris
civilis) compiled and promulgated in A.D. 5 29 by the Roman Emperor
Justinian (reigned 5 27-565). The Corpus iuris civilis consists of:
I The Institutes: a general and comprehensive textbook of Roman
law. It was based on the ltzstitutes of Gaius (c. A.D. 1 1 0-1 80), a jurist
of the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. Gustinian
destroyed the sources of his codification, but the main text of
Gaius' Instittltes was discovered in a palimpsest in 1 8 1 6 by the legal
historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1 776-183 I).)
2 The Pandects (from pan declzesthai - 'taking in all'): a lengthier
compilation of earlier legal sources, organized under headings.
3 The Codex, a collection of enactments by past emperors.
4 The Novels, new laws enacted by Justinian himself.
On account of its reception by the eleventh century revival (chiefly at
the great law school of Bologna), the Corpus iuris civilis was later to
become the basis for all modern conti.rlental European systems of law.
The standard edition of the Corpus iuris civilis was edited by Mornrn­
sen and Krueger (1 895). Cf. also Corpus iuris civilis: The Instittltes,
translated by Thomas C. Sandars (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press,
1970). The standard edition of the ltlstitlltes of Gaius is by F. de
Zulueta (2 volumes, 1946, 1 953). The standard reference work on
Roman law in English is W. W. Buckland, Textbook o/Roman Lawfrom
Augustus to Justinian, 3rd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1963).

3 Compare the following passage from Montesquieu:
The government most conformable to nature is that which best
agrees with the humor and disposition of the people in whose
favor it is established . . . Law in general is human reason,
inasmuch as it governs all the inhabitants of the earth: the politi­
cal and civil laws of each nation ought to be only the particular
cases in which human reason is applied. They should be adapted
in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it
should be a great chance if those of one nation should suit
another. They should be in relation to the nature and principle of
each government: whether they form it, as may be said of political
laws, or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.
They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the
quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal
occupation of the natives . . . They should have relation to the
degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion
of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, com­
merce, manners and customs. In fine, they have relations to each
other, as also to their origin, to the intent of the legislator, and to
the order of things on which they are established; in all of which
different lights they ought to be considered.
(Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of
the Laws, tr. by T. Nugent (New York: Hafner, 1 962) 1, 1 .3, pp.
6-7)
4 These remarks are directed against the �w, whose
chief representative was Hegel's colleague in Berlin, Friedrich Karl
von Savigny (1 779-1 861) (see § 2 I I , note 4). The historical school
reacted against Enlightenment attempts to interpret law in terms of an
�n, approaching it instead by grasping it historically, in
terms of the original meaning legal provisions had \vithin the social
context in which they arose. This approach represented a genuine
respect for the empirical history of law, but also a Romantic reverence
for tradition and national heritage and a rejection of the claims of
human reason in the social and political sphere, which went along
with the Romantic rejection of the Enlightenment and the ideals of
the French Revolution. It is this latter aspect of the historical school
which draws Hegel's criticisms. Savigny was a leading academic
representative of Prussian conservatism; he and Hegel did not get
along well, either philosophically or personally. Hegel never mentions
Savigny by name in PR (cf., however, VPR17 54), but he is doubtless
a target here and again in P R § § 2 1 1 R, 2 1 2R.

school of law, was professor of law at G5ttingen. Hegel refers to his
Lehrbuch des rijmischen Reclus (Textbook ofRoma1l Law), 5th ed. (Berlin:
A. Mylius, 1 8 1 5).
The Twelve Tables was the early Roman legal code, promulgated
about 450 B.C. The reference is to the following passage from Marcus
Tullius Cicero (I06-43 B.C.): 'Truly it seems to me that all the collec­
tions of philosophical books are outweighed, both in their importance
and in the wealth of their utility, by the one little book which contains
the Twelve Tables of Law' (Cicero, De oratore 1 .44).
Aulus Gellius lived in the second century A.D. His Noctes Atticae (Attic
Nights) are twenty books of essays on a wide variety of subjects, which
is a valuable source of anecdotes, quotations, and observations on life
in classical Rome. Favorinus was a second-century philosopher, born
at Aries in Gaul, whom Aulus Gellius admired. Sextus Caecilius was
a jurist from Africa. Both Favorlnus and Sextus Caecilius belonged to
the court of the Emperor Hadrian (A.D. I I 7-138). The conversation
between them serves Hugo's purpose (see notes 4 and 5 above)
because in it a jurist learned in the history of the law corrects the
philosopher's criticisms of traditional statutes by showing them to be
based on misunderstandings caused by ignorance of the historical
circumstances in which the laws were made.
In 376 B.C., under the Roman Republic, the tribunes P. Licinius Stoia
and L. Sextius Lateranus proposed certain measures (commonly cal­
led the 'Licinian Rogations') which were aimed at agrarian reforms, at
reducing political inequalities between patricians and plebeians, and
at remedying the distress of the poor (especially debtors). The law of
Stoia limited each citizen's ownership of land to 500 jugera. Over
patrician objections, they were adopted in 367 B.C. with great success,
but by A.D. 100 they were considered antiquated (see Livy, History of
Rome 2.6.35-38).
The lex Voc01lia (promulgated 169 B.C.) regulated the inheritances of
women (see Cicero, De re publica 3 . I O).
As Aulus GeIIius makes clear, the 'Licinian Law' intended here was a
sumptuary law, which prosperity had since rendered obsolete (Noctes
Atticae 20.1 .25).
Shylock lends 3,000 ducats to Bassanio, on condition that if he fails to
repay, Shylock may take a pound of flesh from Antonio, who, out of
friendship to Bassanio, generously agrees to the bargain (Mercha1lt of
Ve1lice r.iii) . Shylock is prevented from enforcing the bond by the
precise interpretation placed on it by Portia.
This is what Aulus GeIIius reports as Sextus Caecilius' opinion (Noc­
tes Atticae 20. 1 .41-50).

referred to a vehicle drawn by yoked animals (Noctes Atticae 20. I .2830). An arcera is a covered vehicle; Favorinus thinks it extravagant to
specifY it as a conveyance for bringing sick witnesses to court (Noctes
Atticae 20. I .29-3 I).
14 Hugo cites Leibniz's authority for the claim that jurists are generally
superior to metaphysicians in drawing rigorous deductive inferences
from principles: 'Jurisprudence itself is a science having very much to
do with reasoning, and among the ancients I find nothing which
approaches the style of the geometers as much as that of the pandects'
(philip Wiener (ed.) Leibniz: Selections (New York: Scribner, 195 I), p.
580). But Hegel regards deductive inference as only a superficial side
of philosophy (EL §§ 1 8 1 , 23 1), characteristic of the dogmatic
metaphysics of the understanding (cf. E L § § 26-3 6).
15 The Twelve Tables did not permit children emancipated from their
father's authority (patria potestas, see § 172, note I and § 1 80, notes 2,
3, 9) to inherit from their father's estate; rather than revoke this
outright, praetorian edicts permitted emancipated children to share in
the estate by a legal fiction under the name b01lOrum possessio - 'pos­
session of goods'. This device is recorded in Gaius, Instittttes 3.25-28.
16 This legal device is mentioned by one of Hegel's main sources for the
history of Roman law: Johann Christian Gottlieb Heineccius (168 11 741), Amiquitatttm Romanarum iurisprudetztiam illustramium syntagma
(Illustrated Treatise OIZ Alzcietzt Roman Jurisprudence) (1st ed., Halae de
Magdeburg: Novi Bibliopolli, 1 7 1 9).

I Cf. Genesis 2:22-23.
2 This is a reference to the Kantian position on freedom of the will, and
specifically to the position of Fries (VP G III, 41915 I I). Kant
sometimes regards freedom of the will, along with the existence of
God and the immortality of the soul, as objects of moral faith or belief
(Critique ofPure Reason, B xxx) ; but he rejected the view that we have
any immediate consciousness of freedom (KpV 4i4). Fries, on the
other hand, thinks that 'for the human being basic ethical truths are
valid with immediate, irrefutable necessity, hence he is conscious of
his freedom'; sometimes he infers from this that we do not need to
believe (glaubetl) in it, as we do need to believe in God and
immortality; but in other places he does speak of the 'belief' or 'faith'
(Glaube) which we have in our freedom on the basis of moral con­
sciousness (Fries, AKV I, xvii-xviii; II, 259; III, 25 I).

I From Hegel's lectures of 1 822-1 823: 'Freedom is just thinking itself.

Whoever rejects thinking and speaks of freedom, does not know what
he is talking about' (V G P III, 308/402). From what Hegel says
elsewhere, the intended target of these remarks seems to be Wolffian
rationalism (EL § 28,A; cf. V G P III, 3 1 2/407, E G § 468; cf. below
§ 1 5, note I).
2 Cf. VR I, 345-350/n, 3 1-40.
3 In PR, Hegel has few good words to say about the French Revolution,
but this is uncharacteristic of him (perhaps a concession to the Prus­
sian censors, see Preface, note 6). Compare, however, his remark in
§ 258R, which alludes to it as 'the overthrow of all existing and given
conditions within an actual major state alld the revisioll ofits cOllstittltioll
from first prilldples atld purely in tenlls of thought' (emphasis added).
Hegel regards the Terror as resulting from the first, merely abstract
form in which the principle of freedom was applied to the state, but he
regards the Revolution as having accomplished the overcoming of
spirit's self-alienation, bringing the other-worldly aspirations of
Christianity to actuality in the here and now (phG 1111 584-593).
Though never a Jacobin, Hebel always regarded the Revolution as a
colossal and progressive world-historical event (VP G 53 1-535/449452). In 1 807, after the army of Napoleon had conquered Prussia, he
wrote:
Thanks to the bath of her revolution, the French nation has
freed herself of many institutions which the human spirit had
outgrown like the shoes of a child. These institutions accordingly
once oppressed her, and they now continue to oppress other
nations as so many fetters devoid of spirit. What is even more,
however, is that the individual as well has shed the fear of death
along with the life of habit - which, with the change of scenery, is
no longer self-supporting. This is what gives this nation the great
power she displays against others. She weighs down upon the
impassiveness and dullness of these other nations, which, finally
forced to give up their indolence in order to step out into actu­
ality, will perhaps . . . surpass their teachers.
(B I,85/r23)
A student reported that in 1 826 Hegel still drank a toast to the
Revolution on Bastille day: 'He explained its significance and said that
a year never passed without his celebrating the anniversary in this way'
(quoted by T. M. Knox, 'Hegel and Prussianism', in Walter Kauf­
mann (ed.) Hegel's Political Philosophy (New York: Atherton, 1970), p.
20). See also Jean Hyppolite, Sttldies in Hegel and Ma1X (New York:

4 Compare the following, from Hegel's lectures of 1 824-1825: 'The
human being can abstract from every content, make himself free of it,
whatever is in my representation I can let it go, I can make myself
entirely empty . . . The human being has the self-consciousness of
being able to take up any content, or ofletting it go, he can let go of all
bonds of friendship, love, whatever they may be' (VP R IV, I I I-I 1 2).

I In Fichte's Scietlce ofKl/Owledge (Wissetlschafislehre), the first principle

is the identity of the '! with itself (W § I , 9 1-101/93-102). The
second principle is that of opposition, in which the 'I', in order to form
a determinate conception of itself, must posit a not-'I' (W § 2, 101I05/r02-105). Hegel's position is that self-consciousness and con­
sciousness of a not-self are not two successive principles, but are
inseparable from one another (E G §§ 449-450), cf. Hegel, V G P III,

I Christian Wolff (1 679-1754), a follower of Leibniz, was the most
important German philosopher in the first half of the eighteenth
century. In 1 723 he was dismissed from his professorship at the
University of Halle at the instigation of the pietists (he was restored to
his position at Halle in 1 740, upon the accession of Frederick the
Great). One of the points of controversy was the allegation that Wolff
denied freedom of the will because he held that every volition is
determined by a sufficient reason (VG P Ill, 256-257/350-3 5 1 ; cf.
E L § 35,A).
2 Kant does maintain that only Willkiir, and not Wille, is free (TL 2 1 22 1 3/9-10). But he does not mean by this that we act most freely when
we act arbitrarily. Rather, he means that our freedom consists in our
capacity to choose which maxim we adopt (the faculty of Willkiir, Lat.
arbitri1l11l) rather than in the faculty of Wille (Lat. vo!wztas), which
rationally legislates to our capacity to choose. Hegel also attributes
this view to Fries, on equally dubious grounds (VG P III, 419/5 I I).
But the view that freedom consists in arbitrariness was held by some
of the Romantics, such as Friedrich Schlegel (see following note).
3 Phidias (c. 500-430 B.C.), a friend of Pericles, was one of the greatest
of Athenian artists, creator of three statues of Athene on the Acro­
polis, and sculptor, or at least supervisor, of the frieze of the Par­
thenon. Hegel's remark here is a critical reference to Romantic

399

Notes to pages 49-51
theories of art, which locate the superiority of modem poetry (Poesie)
to ancient poetry in the fact that among the modems the work expres­
ses the personal peculiarities and arbitrariness of the artist. In particu­
lar, it seems to be a response to the contrast of 'Romantic' to
'Classical' poetry formulated by Friedrich Schlegel (I767-I829):
Romantic poetry is a progressive universal poetry. It can lose
itself so completely in its subject matter that one may consider its
supreme purpose to be the characterization of poetic individuals
of every kind; and yet there is no form better suited to the
complete self-expression of the spirit of the author, so that many
an artist who merely wanted to write a novel [Romal1] willy nilly
portrayed himself . . . The Romantic genre . . . alone is infinite, as
it alone is free; its supreme law is that the arbitrariness [Willkiir]
of the author shall be subject to no law. The Romantic genre is
the only one that is more than a genre, but is, as it were, poetry
itself; for in a certain sense, all poetry is or should be Romantic.

Friedrich Schlegel Atlsgabe II, Charakteristike1l tl1ld Kritikell I, ed.

§ IJ
I The 'tedious platitudes' are probably what Kant calls 'counsels of
prudence', 'e.g. those of diet, economy, courtesy, restraint, which are
shown by experience best to promote well-being on the average'
(Kant, G 4I8/36). Like Kant, Hegel thinks that because human
desires and circumstances are so variable, there are no universal
principles which lead, always and without exception, to human
happiness.

§ I8
I The idea that human nature was fundamentally good was in Hegel's

day commonly associated with the name of Rousseau. Kant had, to
the chagrin of Goethe, defended the Christian idea that human
nature had a fundamental propensity to evil. But Kant's position was
not that natural human drives and inclinations were evil, only that the
human will, which is free to subject natural desires to the law of
reason, has a propensity to do the reverse (R 2612 I, 36/3 I).

drives, but not in individual ones; instead we should calculate to

absolute freedom as 'being with oneself ill atl other (PR § ¢; E G
§§ 3 82,A and 469; E L § 2¢). I am absolutely free when even that
which I oppose to myself as an object is also me. 'That in which I am

is in its homeland [Hei11lat], in its element' (VP RI9 I 22). Hegel's
claim that the state is the actuality of concrete freedom (PR § 260) is
the claim that it is in the state that the individual self is most fully at
home or 'with itself, or at least that those objects in which the self is
at home require the institutions of the state for their actuality.

I Hegel intends the P R to be structured according to the speculative
method, whose stages are moments of the absolute idea (EL § § 236242). These moments correspond to the structure of speculative
logic: (I) immediate being (EL § 240), (2) essence (EL § 241), 8) the
concept, and (4) the Idea (EL § 242). Abstract right apparently cor­
responds to the stage of immediate being (cf. P R § 34), morality to
the stage of essence or reflection (c( PR § lOS), and ethical life to the
sphere of the concept; and this implies that the state, as ethical life
fully developed, would correspond to the Idea. But Hegel describes
ethical life as the Idea (P R § 1 42) and the state as the actuality of the
ethical Idea (P R § 257).

'Morality' refers to the subjective life of the individual agent, in so far
as it abstracts itself from its social and historical situation and reflects
critically on them, or considers its moral predicament without taking
them explicitly into account; Hegel tends to identifY morality with the
standpoint of Kantian moral philosophy (cf. P R § § 105-108, PhG ��
596-598, E G § § 503-5 1 2). 'Ethics' or 'ethical life' (Sittlicllkeit)
means something like 'customary morality'. Hegel uses it to refer
simultaneously to a system of social institutions (PR § 1 44) and to the
moral attitude of the individual who identifies with and lives them
(P R §§ 146-147). Ethical life is supposed to harmonize or reunite
what is separated by morality (pR § 141; cf. P R §§ 142-157; PhG ��

and actions in Roman law, see Justinian, Illstitlltes 1 .2.I2; Justinian,
Digest 1 .5.I, and Gaius, Illstiflltes 1 .8.
2 Kant, R L § 1 0, 260. 'Right of things' is the right of ownership over
them ( R L § § I I-17); 'right of persons' is the right to a voluntary
performance of actions by some person or persons, acquired by con­
tract ( R L § § 1 8-21); 'personal rights of a real kind' ( R L § 22) are
rights involved in family relationships: the right of spouses over one
another (RL § § 24-27) and the right of parents over children (RL

§ § 28-29).
3 According to one of Hegel's main sources for Roman law: 'In law,

4

man and person are quite distinct. A man is a being who possesses a
human body and a mind endowed with reason; a person is a man
regarded as having a certain status' (J. G. Heineccius, Elementa iuris
civilis (Elements ofCivil Law) (AmstelodaIni [Amsterdam], 1 726), § 75 ·
Caput refers to the possession of a certain legal status; a person
undergoes capitis dimi111ltio when this status is changed or lost, as by
being sold into slavery (Justinian, I1lstitutes 1 .16.I-2; cf. Gaius,

I1lstiflltes 1 . I 60).
5 Perhaps the basis for identifYing the right of persons with family law is
that in Roman law three things were required for someone to be a
'person': (I) caput, or status (see above, note 4), (2) libertas, or the
capacity to be subject to the rights and obligations of a Roman citizen,
and 6) fomilia, or the capacity to be subject to the rights and obliga­
tions of membership in a Roman family (Justinian, Digest 1 .5). But as
Hegel was aware, 'person' was sometimes used in a looser sense in
Roman law, so that even a slave could sometimes
on'

Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his brother Gaius Gracchus dur­
ing the second century B.C. The refonns had to do with the ager
publiClls, or lands obtained by Rome through conquests, and the
appropriation of these lands by individuals. Legislation instituted in
133 B.C. by Tiberius Gracchus limited the amount of land an
individual could own, providing for the confiscation of excess hold­
ings and their distribution to smaller landholders. The large landed
interests arranged for the assassination of Tiberius Gracchus in 133,
but the laws were enacted by Gaius Gracchus in 124 (in 1 2 1 he was

also murdered). In I I I B.C. the lex Thoria annulled many of the Grac­
chan reforms. Hegel apparendy views the Gracchi as asserting the
right of the community over the ager pllbliclIs and their opponents as
asserting the right of individuals to appropriate land.
2 An entailment (fideicommissa) limits the rights of heirs to dispose of
inherited property, requiring them to keep it in the family: 'When it is

that it should remain in a family either perpetually or for a specified
number of generations, this is called a family entailment [Fidei­

cf. Justinian, Illstitlltes 2.23, Gaius, Iustitlltes 2.246-247). Hegel
regards such provisions as undue limitatior,s on the right of private
property (cf. P R § I 80). But he argues, too, that family property is
,�, with the father acting merely as admin�
tor; this means that Hegel also limits a father's right to bequeath
property outside the family, since it is held in common by the family
and is not his private property in the first place (PR § § I 78-I80).
3 Plato's Repllblic specifies that the guardians' life-style should be gov­
erned by the proverb 'all things in common among friends', including
� (Republic 424a, 449C). The most specific
provisions, however, require of the guardians that they liy��!e­
owned quarters, that they possess no money, and that they hold
�rty 'only if it is necessary' (Republic 4I 6e). Later it is
claimed, perhaps hyperbolically, that the guardians will own nothing
b�es (Republic 464d-e). These strictures, however,
apply only to the guardians, not to the most numerous class in Plato's
state, who have no share in political rule, but are owners of property:
'of land, grand and beautiful houses, and furnishings appropriate to
them, gold and silver and all the possessions which are thought to
make men happy' (Republic 4I7b). But compare the comments of the
Athenian stranger in Laws 739b-d:
You'll find the ideal society and state, and the best code of
laws, where the old saying 'friends' property is genuinely shared'
is put into practice as widely as possible throughout the entire
state. Now I don't know whether in fact this situation com­
munity of ,vives, children and all property - exists anywhere
today, or ,vill ever exist, but at any rate in such a state the notion
of 'private property' will have been by hook or by crook com­
pletely eliminated from life.
(plato, Laws 739b-d, tr. T. J. Saunders (Harmondsworth:
Penguin, I 970), p. 207)

The person has one body by nature; human beings have only in
the abstract sense equal right to the totality of other external
things, the earth . . . Each has really an equal right to the whole
earth, as some say. Such a distribution has colossal difficulties,
and with each newborn [person] the division would have to be
taken up once again. �lity is an attribute which expresses an
external reference. All have an equa right to the world; but

Cf. 'Equal right is a right of inequality in its content, like every right'
(Karl Marx, 'Critique of the Gotha Program', Marx Ellgels Selected
Works (New York: International Publishers, 1 968), p. 3 24).
2 This requirement is derived from Fichte, for whom its consequences
are far from trivial. Fichte maintains that if anyone is propertyless,
then he has a right to the property of others: 'Each possesses his civil
property only in so far, and on the condition that, all citizens of the
state can live from what is theirs; and in so far as they cannot live, it
becomes their property' (GNR 2131z93; cf. S L 295/3 I I-3 1 2). In
Fichte's view, the state has both the right and the responsibility to
redistribute property so that all its members can carry on a productive
life on the basis of what they possess.

I The rule of Roman law is res mIl/ius occupallti cedit 'A thing belonging
to no one is ceded to the occupant' (Gaius, I1Istitutes 2.66). Hegel
probably ha�IirindFichte's version of the saying: Res ll1tllius cedit
primo occupatlti (GNR I 33hS5). In Roman law a res mIl/ius was not
necessarily something which had not yet been appropriated by
anyone; it could also be a sacred object, consecrated by pontiffs or by
the Church: such objects were regarded as not properly subject to
human ownership, and their sale or mortgage was forbidden
Gustinian, I1Istitutes 2. I .S). Like Kant and Fichte, Hegel rejects the
possibility of the latter sort of res mtllius (Kant, RL § 2, 246-247/5253; Fichte, GNR I 33hS5; Hegel, P R § 44; cf. Hegel's views on
endowments, § 64A and note 2).
§ S2

I Cf. Fichte, GNR § 19, 2 I 7-2 I9!z99-300. Fichte's principal appli­
cation of the idea is to the ownership of land, implying state dominion
over land, along with redistributive responsibilities (see § 49, note 2).
At one point, Hegel suggests that it is Fichte's view that the matter of
a formed object belongs to God (VPRI7 4S). But this idea would
have been as repugnant to Fichte as to Hegel himself (see § 50, note
1).
§ 53

I A positive judgement is of the form 'x is F' (e.g. 'the rose is red'); a
negative judgement is of the form 'x is not F' (e.g. 'the rose is not
red'); an infinite judgement is of the form 'x is non-F', i.e. x has a
property which complements F (e.g. 'the rose is some colour other
than red') (cf. Kant, Critique ofPure Reasoll A7I-73/B97-gS). This
distinction might be employed, for example, by someone who wants to
preserve the law of the excluded middle while denying both the
(positive) judgement that the number 7 is blue and the (infinite)
judgement that the number 7 is 1I01l-blue. Such a person could still
assert the (negative) judgement that the number 7 is IlOt blue, because
this does not imply that it is any other colour. Hegel discusses these
forms of judgement in WL VI, 3 I I-326/630--643, cf. E L § § 172173. Apparently, Hegel thinks that the will's positive judgement on a�
thing consists in declaring it mine, the ,vill's negative judgement -:- .
consumes the thing or uses it up, and the will's infinite judgement
declares it to be someone else's (cf. § 65A).

Q]liritariulII was originally the only type of property formally

recognized by Roman law; later it was treated as a higher status of
ownership, attributable only to Roman citizens; it was distinguished
from dOlllilliUIII BOllitariu1Il, an ownership recognized by law despite
certain formal defects in the owner's legal title to it (Gaius, IlIstittltes
2.40). (Both the distinction between res lIIatlcipi and res llec lIIatlcipi and
the distinction between quiritarian and bonitarian ownership were
abolished by Justinian.) Hegel regards these distinctions as merely
matters of positive law, irrelevant to the philosophical science of right.
4 DOlllilliulII directlllll is a landlord's ownership of land, while dOlllilli1l1ll
utile is the ownership pertaining to the tenant who uses the property.
From Kant Hegel denvesl)Oth the notion of 'co-ownership' (COtl­
d01llillill1ll) and the distinction between the 'direct owner' (domit/!/S
directus) and the 'owner for use' (domitll/S IItilis) (RL § 17, 270). An
emphyteutic contract grants the proprietor the full and unconditional
use of a piece of land, either perpetually or for a long period of time,
in return for a tithe or rent Uustinian, Novels 7.3. 1-2; Digest
13.7.1 6.2). Unlike the conceptions of property discussed in note 3 ,
Hegel finds these (feudal) conceptions quite relevant t o the
philosophical science of right, because he thinks they violate the very
concept of property as free and full ownership (see note I above).

Natiolls; in his lectures of 1 8 1 9-1 820 he endorses Smith's labour
theory of value: 'Manual labour in general, a day's wages, these are
the final elements of the price of things in relation to each other'
(VP RI9 1 62).

1 For some legal rights, a statute of limitations is specified ('prescribec!.')
by law, and the right expires or lapses (vetjiihrt)'atth-aftime--Uusti!iiini ,

certain length of time unless it is renewed, especially a right which will
be lost It It IS not used for a long time. Hegel holds that tlle-)

2 In the Middle Ages, an endowed mass (missa fimdata) was one com­
mon form of 'pious �illm), by which a sum was set

aside in perpetuity for the purpose of having masses said regularly on
behalf of the soul of the departed. During the English Reformation,
and on the continent after the "French Revolution, the abolition of
such endowments and their appropriation by secular authorities was a
prominent feature of�ecclesiastical legislation and the seculariza­
tion of Church property. In�nce, it was provided for
by Article 55 of the Resolutions of the Deputation of the Empire
(1803) (see 'Endowment', The Catholic Encyclopedia v (New York:

Philosophers (:If Hegel's time were often troubled by the case of pagan
heroes who committed suicide in defiance of Christianity's absolute
prohibition against it. According to Greek legend, Heracles, the
greatest of all Greek heroes, was given a robe poisoned with the blood
of a hydra. It clung to his flesh and caused horrible and incurable

412

Notes to pages I02-IOS
suffering. To escape this Heracles had himself carried to the summit
of Mount Oeta and burned to death on a pyre. After the death of
Pompey, Marcus Porcius Cato (95-46 B.C.) chose to take his own life
rather than be captured by Julius Caesar. Marcus Junius Brutus,
adopted son of Julius Caesar, conspired to murder Caesar and then,
with Cassius, attempted to resist the triumvirs. Defeated by the
armies of Marcus Antonius and Octavianus at the battle of Philippi,
Brutus preferred death to capture, and took his own life by falling on
his sword. In the last analysis, however, Hegel and his contemporaries
generally sided with Christianity even when confronting these cases
(cf. Kant, TL 42 1-423/84-86 and Fichte, S L 261-2671279-284).
Fichte, however, held that although suicide is contrary to moral duty,
persons have a right over their own lives and the state has no right to
forbid suicide by law (G NR 331/425). Once in his lectures, Kant
appears to admit that in the case of Cato, 'suicide is a virtue', but he
hastens to add that 'this is the only example which has given the world
the opportunity of defending suicide' (Kant, VE 1 87/149).
§ 7I

I The basis of personhood for Hegel, as for Fichte, is the mutuality of
�
recognition between free self-consciousnesses (cf. PhG �� 178-200;
EG §§ 430-437; Fichte, GNR § § 3-4, 30-56/48-83).

I Roman law treats a contract as an accord of t:wo ,vilIs Gustinian, Digest
��oes Kant (RL § 18, 271). It is from Fichte that Hegel
derives the idea that a contract establishes a 'common will' (GNR
"""/
1 9312 I I).
2 Hegel alludes to Kant's notorious remark that 'the contract of mar­
riage [is one in which] man and woman ,VilI the reciprocal enjoyment
of one another's sexual attributes' (Kant RL § 24, 277-278).
3 Cf. § 258R and note 1. The contractarian tradition in modem politi­
cal thought includes Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, but its most
immediate representative for Hegel was Fichte, GNR § 17, 1 9 12091209-233. It is interesting that what Hegel finds most objection­
able about this tradition is that it intends to found the state on rela­
tions of abstract right, in particular on property relations. This is at
tJ.le3Jlme time his objection to reactionary absolutism, which treats the
state as the monarch's private property (cf. PR § 258R). Hegel credits

In Roman law, a contract of sale could be voided on the grounds of
'excessive damage' if an item was found to have been sold for less than
half its true value (Justinian, Codex 4.44.2).
2 In Roman law, a stipulatio was a solemn formal promise to perform
(Justinian, Illstitutes 3.15; Gaius, Illstitutes 3.92).
3 See P R § 217.
4 Following Justinian, (Illstittttes 3.13), Kant distinguishes 'unilateral
contracts' (gifts, A in Hegel's table in § 80) from 'bilateral contracts'
(exchanges, B in the table) (Kant, R L § 3 1, 285).

§ 78
I

I

Cf. E G §§ 458-459'

In Roman law a pactum (or pactum 1l1ldum) was an agreement which
could be the basis of a legal obligation, but which did not take the
form of a legal contract, while a colltractus was a formal contract
(Justinian, Digest 2.14). Hegel seems to regard a pactum as a declara­
tion of an intention to alienate a thing or put oneself under an obliga­
tion in the future, as distinct from a contractual agreement which
actually alienates or obligates as of the time of the contract. Only the
latter sort of agreement, he thinks, should create an obligation.
2 Fichte's theory of right is based on a sharp distinction between right
and morality, involving a strict interpretation of the idea that relations
of right have to do only with external actions, and not at all with inner
intentions. Hegel interprets this idea as implying that I am obligated
only by the external performance of the other. What Fichte actually
held in 1793, however, was the highly paradoxical view that not even
the performance of a contract by one party obligates the other party to
perform, since the performance would rather ground a right of
restitution or reparation for losses incurred by the performance, at
least until the second party's performance had been completed
(Fichte, FR 1 14). Later Fichte argued on similar grounds that no
contract can obligate if it is made simply between the two parties
involved in it, because neither can have a sufficient reason to judge

T
Notes to pages IOg-III
that the other intends to perfonn, and each has the right to withhold
perfonnance indefinitely until such a reason is present (GNR
1951220). This argument fonns part of his transcendental deduction
of the necessity of a 'union contract' (Vereinigzmgsvertrag), through
which individuals establish a real cornmon whole uniting them; only
through such a union, he argues, do valid contracts in general become
possible (GNR 198-2071223-23 1).
3 Concerning the 'false infinite', see W L v, 166-17 1h5O-154; EL

§§ 94-95·
4 Roman law distinguishes four kinds of contracts, in descending order
of explicitness:

I Contractus re, involving an actual perfonnance, such as the
handing over of a thing (traditio ret).
2 Colltractus litteris, in which the agreement was written down.
3 Colltractus verbis, through an explicit oral agreement, such as a
stipulation (see § 77, note 2).
4 Contractus Co/lsensu, involving a tacit sign of agreement, such as
the acceptance of some benefit (e.g. the taking possession of
something bought or rented).
Oustinian, Illstitlltes 3.13.2; cf. Digest 44.7. 1, Gaius, Illstitlltes

3.88-89)

§ 80
I Hegel does indeed follow Kant's table of contracts (RL § 3 I , 285286) quite closely. In Kant's taxonomy, Hegel's AI and A3 are in
reverse order; Kant draws no distinction between Hegel's B2U and
B2�; but Kant distinguishes mandatum as B2Y, instead ofleaving it as
an afterthought; and under C, Kant distinguishes between (a) a
pledge (Pigzl/ls), (b) vouching for the promise of another (fideiussio),
and (c) giving a personal guarantee for another (praestatio obsidis).
2 Under real contracts (colltractlls re, § 79, note 4), Roman law in turn
distinguishes four kinds:
I MUlllum, or loan for consumption, to be repaid in kind
Oustinian, Illstillltes 3.14. 1). E.g. I borrow a bushel of grain
from you, eat it, and give you a different bushel of grain in
return. Here the grain was called a res jimgibilis, because it was
a thing on which a claim to a different thing could be founded
(see note 6 below.) A muluum was supposed to be a loan
without charge (see note 5 below).

Notes to pages III-IIS
2 Commodatum, or loan for use only, where the loaned item itself
was to be returned (Justinian, blstitutes 3.I4.2). E.g. I borrow

3
4

your plough, use it, and return the very same plough to you.
Here the plough was called a res 11011 fU1lgibilis (see note 6
below). Again, the loan was supposed to be free of charge (see
note 5 below).
Depositum, a deposit or bailment, a thing left with someone for
safe-keeping (Justinian, IlIstitlltes 3.I4.3).
Piglllls, pledge. A pledge (Lat. piglllls, Ger. Pfolld; cf. the
English word 'pawn') is a thing used as collateral for a loan,
especially when the thing is turned over to the creditor until the
loan is repaid. A piglllls is also a kind of contract, viz. one
establishing a certain thing as a pledge (Justinian, IlIstittttes
3.I4.4). See note 8 below.

3 See note 2 above.
4 Sale (emptio, ve1lditio) refers to the transfer of a thing for a specified
monetary price (Justinian, I'lstitutes 3 .23).
5 Strictly speaking, mlltuU111 and c011lmodatllm were supposed to be
gratuitous loans; if rent was to be paid, then the loan was called a
'letting' or 'hiring' (locatio et cmldllctio) (Justinian, blstitlltes 3.24).
6 A resfimgibilis is a thing to be returned in kind, as in a mllttmm, where
the thing loaned is intended to be consumed; a res 11011 fimgibilis is a
thing which is to be returned itself, as in a commodatllm (Justinian,
Digest I 2.I .6) (see note 2 above).
7 Roman law distinguishes three kinds of locatio: (a) locatio cmldllctio
rertlm, 'letting for hire of a thing', (b) locatio COlldllctio operartl11l, 'letting
for hire of labour', and (c) locatio cmldllctio operis focie1ldi, 'letting for
hire of a labour to be done' (Justinian, IlIstitlltes 3.24, cf. Digest
I9.2.2). In (b), a person hires out services without reference to the
particular labour to be performed, while in (c) the person is hired to
perform a specified task.
8 See note 2 above. Hegel, however, treats the pledge not as a specific
kind of contract, but as a 'moment which completes a [certain kind of]
contract', e.g. a loan.

I

Cf. E L § 173, and P R § 53, note I . A 'positively infinite judgement'
is a judgement which asserts the abstract identity of subject and
predicate, e.g. 'a lion is a lion'. A 'negatively infinite judgement'
asserts the incompatibility of subject and predicate, e.g. 'the mind is
no elephant', 'a lion is no table'. This apparently differs from a simple
negative judgement in that it asserts the incompatibility of the subject
not merely with a certain specific predicate, but with all predicates of a
certain kind. Hegel also compares disease to a negative judgement,
because it negates a particular life-function of the organism; but death
is like a negatively infinite judgement because it negates the organ­
ism's life in its entirety. Hegel regards a civil suit (or unintentional
wrong) as like a simple negative judgement which denies a person's
right to a particular thing; he says that this is parallel to a judgement
such as 'This rose is not red'; a crime, on the other hand, attacks the
right of
and is parallel to the (false) judgement
'This rose has no colour at all' (or, presumably, to the (true) judge­
ment 'The number 7 has no colour at all' (EL § 173A» . Cf. also WL

I There seems little foundation for the claim that the Stoics believed
there is only one virtue and one vice. They apparently did hold (,vith
Plato) that the virtues are inseparable from one another:

, Zeno [founder of the Stoic school] admits several virtues, as
Plito" does, namely,,�e, courage, moderation and justice,
on the grounds that altfiough inseparable they are distinct and
different from one another . . . [The Stoics] say that the virtues
are inter-entailing\ not only because he who has one has them all

does so in accordance ,vith them all.

and D. N. Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers I
(Cambridge University Press, 1 987), pp. 378-379)

If Hegel is alluding to a Stoic doctrine which might be compared with
the notion tha�qual gravity, then he may be thinking
of the Stoic rejection of Aristotle'�at virtue and vice admit of
degrees: 'It is their [the Stoics'] doctrine tha�n
virtue and vice, though the Peripatetics say that progress is in between
�ey say, a stick must be either straigiltOr crooked, so a
man must be either just or unjust but not either more just or more
unjust, and likewise with the other virtues' (Diogenes Laertius 7.127,
in The Hellenistic Philosophers I, p. 3 80). (
2 Draco recodified Athenian laws in 62 I B.C., with the aim of replacing
private vengeance with public justice. The proverbial rigidity and
severity of his punishments 'is probably exaggerated in most accounts,
such as Plutarch's description of Solon's reforms of them in 594 B.C.:
'Being once asked why he made death the punishment of most
offences, [l)raco] replied, "Small .ones deserve that, and I have no
higher for the greater crimes" ; (plutarch, Lift of SOIOlI in Plutarch 5
Lives, tr. John Dryden (New York: Random House, 1960), p. 107; cf.
Aristotle, Politics 2.12. 1 274b).
3 Roman law distinguishes 'theft' (filrtU1ll) from 'robbery' (rapina, vi
bona rapta) which involves the taking of a thing by force Oustinian,
Institutes 4. 1-2). Furtu1Il, however, has a much broader meaning than
the English 'theft', and includes embezzlement and conversion
(Institutes 4.I .6), the application of a borrowed item to a use not
intended by the lender (Institutes 4.\ .7) and even the use of one's own

Hegel may be alluding to the following passage: 'By punishment in
the most universal sense is understood an evil [Ubelj which follows
upon an illegal action as such. In so far as such an evil is used for the
effecting of future lawful actions or omissions, a punishment in the
usual signification is present. A genuine punishment in the usual
signification presupposes that the evil is voluntarily [willkiirlich] com­
bined with the unallowed action toward the end specified' {Ernst
Ferdinand Klein (1744-1 8 1 0), Grzmdsiitze des gemeillen delltsellell tl1ld

prenfJisellen peitlliellen Reellts (Prillciples ofCommoll Genllall alld Pmssiatl
Pellal Law) (Halle: Hemmende & Schmetzke, 1 799), p. 6). Klein was
one of the co-authors of the Pmssiall General Legal Code of 1794.

Hegel thinks that it is an el1'or to build conseEuentialist considere.­
�ons into the very concept of punis� Klein suggests here.
Instead, Hegcl mSlsts that the concept of punishment involves
,retributive considerations ('wron and ·ustice'), even if punishment is
also used to achieve desirable consequences (such as preventing
future violations of law).
2 Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach (177 5-1833), father of the
Young Hegelian philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach (1 8°4-1 872), was
author of the influential Lehrbllell des gemeilletl hi Detltselzlalld giiltigetl

peilllielletl Reellts (Textbook of the Penal Law Commollly Valid ill Ger­
mallY) (1801). He was a proponent of penal reform, best known for
successfully implementing the rule mllillm crimetl, 1l1l11a poena sille lege

('no crime, no nunishment without law') - which restricted the power
��'V,/Z\7 �
of courts to administer punishment unless there was a crime and a
corresponding punishment for it provided by legal statute. He was
also author of the Bavariall Petial Code (1813) which, along with the
Napoleonic Code,, 0-rmed the basis of continental pena�tion
��most ��ry. His philosophical theory
of punishrrie¥,based on the idea of a threat published in advance, is
found in his Textbook: Book I ('Philosophical or Universal Part of

Cesare Beccaria (1738-1794), often considered the father of modern

�riffi1� the most important theorist of penal reform in the

eighteenth century. His influence is based almost entirely on his Dei
delitti e delle petie (011 Crimes alld Ptmishments) (1 764), which was best
known in the French translation of the Abbe Morellet (1 766). It
influenced enlightened sovereigns throughout Europe, including the

2 The Emperor Joseph II of Austria (reigned 1765-179°) prom]!Jgated
a new penal law in 1787 which substituted life imprisonment for the
death penalty, but th-e death penalty was reinstituted in 1795. The
death penalty was retained in the French Penal Code of 1791, but
only with restrictions and after a long and searching debate.

punish theft (VPR III, 304-305).

able by restoration to the victim of more than was stolen; the victim of
a theft is permitted to wound or even kill the thief, if the theft occurs
at night (if such a killing occurs during the day, it is murder and
punishable by death) (Exodus 22:1-4). Blackstone also draws the

mother, Orestes followed the advice of Apollo and fled from the
avenging Eumenides, taking refuge on the Areopagus (or Hill of Ares)
in Athens, where he was acquitted in a trial presided over by Athena

In general, the 'nature' of anything for Hegel is what we grasp from
!ational reflection upon it and its connection wifuothertliliigs (EL
§ 23). Accordingly, the nature of an action includes those conse­
quences which rational reflection might have anticipated. 'In general
it is important to think about the consequences of an action because in
this way one does not stop with the immediate standpoint but goes
beyond it. Through a many-sided consideration of the action, one will
be led to the nature of the action' (NP 230).

2 Oedipus killed his father and married his mother, but did not believe

(and had no reason to believe) that he was committing parricide in the
first case or incest in the second; yet he regarded himself as a crimi­
nal. Hegel regards this as indicative of the naive simplicity (GediegC1l­
heit) of the attitude of Greek ethical life, illWhIc:fipl:fieCoiiCe t of moral
subjectivity had yet to develop (cf. PhG �� 468-470). Hegel has
s-Gcirarr�ncient Greeks' view of responsibility
for acts,.9-®e in madn<:§s: 'e.g. Ajax, when he killed the Greeks' cattle
and sheep in an insane fury because he had not received the arms of
Achilles; he did not attribute the guilt to his insanity, as though in it he
were another being, but took the whole action upon himself as its
perpetrator and did away ,vith himself from shame' (NP 224).

2 According to Herodotus (whose account cannot be true, since it is

Greek sage Solon: 'Who is the happiest man you have ever seen?' The
question was rhetorical, since Croesus expected to be told that he
himself was the happiest. Solon, however, denied that he could
estimate Croesus' happiness until he had seen the end of his life. Life
is such a chancy thing, said Solon, that we should call no man happy
until he is dead. Solon's caution was confirmed when Croesus was
defeated by the Persian King Cyrus. According to Herodotus, Cyrus

If we consider the history of Greek philosophy, then we find
that an [idea of] universal happiness occurred to Solon when he
spoke to Croesus. With such a theory of happiness milder mores
[Sitten] naturally supervene, since you strive after a universal and
the power of human nature is broken. Solon also demands of
Croesus that happiness is not constituted by what one has right
now, but rather by one's whole way of life and death. Solon's
thought did not go beyond this happiness.

Compare the following remarks from Hegel's Ellcyclopaedia
and the lectures on it:

A human being - as he is externally, i.e. in his actions
(obviously, not in his merely bodily externality), so he is inwardly;
and when he is virtuous, moral, etc. Dilly inwardly, i.e. Dilly in
intentions, dispositions, and when his externals are not identical
with this, then the one is as hollow and empty as the other.
(E L § 1 40)
We are accustomed to say of human beings that everything
depends on their essence [Wesell] and not on their deeds and
conduct. Now in this lies the correct thought that what a human
being does should be considered not in its immediacy, but only by
means of his inwardness and as a manifestation of that inward­
ness. But with that thought we must not overlook the point that
the essence and also the inward only prove themselves as such by
stepping forth into appearance. On the other hand, the appeal
which human beings make to inwardness as an essence distinct
from the content of their deeds often has the intention of validat­
ing their mere subjectivity and in this way of escaping what is
valid in and for itself.
(E L § 1 1 2A)
2 As usual, Hegel's quotation from Schiller is from memory, and not
precisely accurate:

3 The French bOil mot 'No man is a hero to his valet de clzambre' is
usually attributed to Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, Marquise de Sevigne
(I 626-I696). But the best evidence, a letter by Charlotte Elisabeth
Aisse (I 695-I733), attributes it to Mme Comuel (I 605-I694): 'I
remind you of what Mme Comuel said, that there is no hero at all for
his valet de clzalllbre, and no Fathers of the Church for their con­
temporaries' (Lettres de Mile Aissi a Mille Cale1ldritzi (Paris: Stock,
Delamain & Boutelleau, I 943), letter of I3 August I728. The idea,
however, was much older: 'Few men have been admired by their
domestics' (Montaigne (I533-I592), Essays III, 2); when the
Macedonian general Antigonus (c. 382-30I B.C.), was described by
Hermodotus as 'Son of the Sun', he replied: 'My servant is not aware
of it' (quoted by Plutarch, Apotlzegms, 'Antigonus'). Hegel was the first
to add: 'Yet not because the former is no hero, but rather because the
latter is only a valet de clzambre' (PhG � 665). Goethe used the saying
(with a slighdy different version of Hegel's wry addition) two years
later in the novel Die Walz!venvalzdtsclzajie1l (Elective Affillities): 'There
is, it is said, no hero for his chamber servant. That is only because a
hero can be recognized only by a hero. The servant will probably
know how to evaluate only his equals' (ElectiveAffillities, Part 5, Chap­
ter 2, Ottilie's diary, Goethe, Werke VI, ed. Erich Trunz (Munich:
Beck, I982), p. 398; cf. VG I 04f87). The attitude targeted by
Hegel's remarks in P R was expressed by Fries in the following
passage:
Reflective, living strength of soul gives a human being charac­
ter; but not yet morality of character . . . Morality of character
consists in the \viII's subjecting itself to the higher law with pure
respect. Someone might show reflectiveness, patience and

Notes to pages 152-155
tranquillity, valour and moderation, yet without being led by any
idea of the good. Rather, such a reflective steadfastness will be
proper to the most dangerous characters in history, who are ruled
(Fries, H P P 242)
by crude ambition and lust for power.

4 The quotation is from Propertius, Elegies 2. 10.6. Sextus Aurelius
Propertius (c. 50-10 B.C.) wrote lyric verse pervaded by a spirit of
melancholy, self-absorption, and self-pity, original in its time but later
common in Latin elegiac poetry.

source which says anything about their stealing leather for their noble
labours. See Sabine Baring-Gould, Lives of the Saints (Edinburgh:

punishment for murder: 'If justice should perish, it would no longer
be worthwhile for men to remain alive on earth . . . Even if a civil
society were to dissolve itself by common agreement of all its mem­
bers . . . the last murderer remaining in prison must first be executed

1 The explicit reference here is to Christian Wolff (see above, § 1 5,
note I) and his theory of clear and obscure ideas (see Wolff, PsycllOlo­
gica empirica, Gesammelte Werke 11.5 (Halle, 1 962), § 220). Hegel's
actual target is probably Fries's account of moral imputability (H P P
§ § 48-52). Fries distinguishes between legal and moral imputability
(HP P pp. 1 86-203). Regarding the former, the question is simply
whether the agent did the deed intentionally (H P P pp. 1 89-19°);
regarding moral responsibility, however, Fries argues that we must
distinguish within the agent's character between what comes from
nature and what is due to the agent's freedom (HP P pp. 1 90-19 1).
Fries argues that acts must be judged morally by nothing but the
degree to which the decision to perform them is motivated by duty.
This motive may sometimes arise from moral fteljllg, which Fries
characterizes (in Leibnizian-Wolffian terminology) as 'obscure
thought', that is, thought which has not been logically resolved into its
rational grounds (H P P pp. 207-208). For Fries, the educability
(Bildllllgsfohigkeit) of conscience consists in developing one's thoughts
about duty toward clarity, possibly with consequent revisions in what
one understands the content of one's duty to be (H P P pp. 208, 2 1 02 1 1 , 2 1 3-2 1 5). Fries does not say that people are responsible only for
acts accompanied by such 'clear thoughts', but he apparently does
hold that we are not to be blamed for following our sincerely held
moral convictions, even if clarification of our moral thoughts would
reveal them to be objectively wrong. See below, § 1 40, note 1 3 .

I Pascal's Provi1lcial Letters (1656) are a polemical contribution to dis­

putes in Catholic moral theology between the Jesuits (members of the
Society of Jesus) and the Jansenists (followers of Cornelius Jansenius
(1585-1638), Bishop of Ypres in Flanders). Specifically, they are a
defence of Antoine Arnauld (16I I-1694), who was censured in 1655
for his adherence to certain Jansenist doctrines. The passage quoted
by Hegel is an ironic comment on the views expressed in the following
excerpts from the writings of various Jesuits:
For someone to sin and incur guilt before God, he must know
that what he intends to do is no good, or at least have doubts or
fears on that score.
[quoted from Father Etienne Beauny, StlmmaT)' ofSi1ls (1633)]
Anyone with no thought of God, or his sins, or any apprehen­
sion of an obligation to perform acts of love toward God, or acts
of contrition, has no actual grace to perform these acts; but it is
also true that he commits no sin if he omits them.
[quoted from Franc;ois Annat, T7ze Good Faith of the Ja1lse1lists

(1655)]
1. On the one hand God imparts to the soul a certain love
which inclines it toward the thing commanded, and on the other
rebellious concupiscence invites it to do the opposite. 2. God
inspires the soul with a knowledge of its weakness. 3. God
inspires it with knowledge ofthe physician who is to cure it. 4. God
inspires it with the desire to be cured. 5. God inspires it with
the desire to pray and implore his help. And unless all these
things take place in the soul, the action is not stricdy sinful, and
cannot be imputed.
[quoted from Pierre LeMoine, a close associate of Cardinal
Richelieu]

Notes to pages lJI-I'J2
Pascal's comment on these views immediately precedes the passage
quoted by Hegel:
Oh Father, what a blessing for some of the people I know! I
must bring them along to you. You can hardly have met people
with fewer sins, for they never think of God; vice has warped their
reason: They have never knOWTl their infirmity nor the physician
who can cure it. They have never thought of desiring spiritual
health, still less of praying God to grant it, so that they are in a
state of baptismal innocence according to M. LeMoine. The
thought of loving God has never entered their heads, nor that of
being contrite for their sins; thus, according to Fr. Annat, they
have committed no sin through being without charity or repent­
ance; their life is a continual search for pleasure of every kind,
uninterrupted by the slightest twinge of remorse. Such excesses
had led me to believe that their damnation was assured; but I
learn from you, Father, that these same excesses ensure their
salvation . . . I had always thought that the less one thought of
God the more sinful one was. But, from what I can see, once one
has managed to stop thinking of him altogether the purity of all
one's future conduct becomes assured. They will all be damned,
these half-sinners . . .

3 Aristotle distinguishes actions done 'in ignorance', including those
done in rage or drunkenness, from cases of actions 'done by reason of
ignorance' or 'caused by ignorance' (of particular circumstances).
The latter sort of action is involuntary, but the former is not a case of
involuntariness, and the agent is to blame.

6 This is a reference to Fries (see note 13 below and § 132, note 1
above).
7 This is a theological topic also discussed in Pascal's Provi1lcial Letters.
Catholic and Lutheran theology customarily distinguish 'prevenient
grace', which makes the human will free, from 'co-operating grace',
which assists in the salvation of those who seek it. Co-operating grace
may be either 'efficacious grace' which is so strong that the soul
cannot resist it, or it may be of lesser strength and resistible (if
accepted, however, the latter is called 'sufficient grace'). The contro­
versy is whether grace is ever 'efficacious', in other words, whether
the will retains the freedom to reject co-operating grace. Jesuits were

I
i

Notes to pages 172-175
inclined to answer this question in the affirmative, Jansenists to
answer it in the negative. Hegel apparently interprets the issue in
terms of the relationship between objective knowledge of the good
and subjective conscience; siding with Pascal's Jansenist position (as
he has reinterpreted it) Hegel wants to deny that the relation between
objective knowledge and subjective conscience is one of separability,
indifference and contingency.
8 Cf. PhG n 660-666.
9 Probabilism is a Jesuit doctrine, for which Hegel's source is once
again Pascal. According to probabilism, we incur no guilt even if we
do wrong, so long as the moral opinion according to which we act is
'probable'. Pascal's attack on the doctrine is part of the Jansenist
at the Jesuits have acquired secular and ecclesiastical
influence by sycophancy, adapting their theological and moral advice
to the desires and interests of the rich and powerful. To this end,
Pascal quotes from various Jesuit fathers the following account of
what the 'probability' of a moral opinion consists in:

'cIlargeth

An opinion is called probable when it is founded on reasons of
some importance. Whence it sometimes happens that one really
grave doctor can make an opinion probable . . . You may perhaps
doubt whether the authority of one good and learned doctor
makes an opinion probable . . . I reply that . . . a probable opinion

13 The target of these remarks is Fries. 'The command of duties of
virtue commands: to act from respect for the law according to one's
conviction of what the duty of virtue requires' (Fries, NKV III, 1 89).
The 'immediate command of virtue' is: 'Give allegiance to your own
conviction of duty!' (Fries, H P P 243, cf. H P P 1 5 8, 1 64). Fries
distinguishes 'conviction' (Oberzeugzmg) from mere 'opinion'
(A1eilllmg). Conviction is formed by a process of moral education and
experience, yet 'not by learning rules but by the exercise of the moral
sentiment' (Fries, NKV III, 206-208; cf. Fries, J E 55123). In fact,
Fries insists that to be morally genuine, my conviction must be 'pure'
(lauter): 'By the virtue of purity I understand a man's truthfulness and
sincerity toward himself and in himself' (HP P 344); self-deceiving
moral beliefs and rationalizations do not count for Fries as 'pure
convictions'. Fries allows us no faculty for the infallible knowledge of
our duty. Conscience, he insists, is 'educable' (bildtmgsfohig) (HP P
2 1 4); but he still maintains (as did Kant and Fichte before him) that
conscience is 'infallible':
It can easily appear that the doctrine of the infallibility of
conscience stands opposed to this doctrine of the educability of
conscience. The following should clear this up. For the man who
has attained to purity (Lauterkeit), conscience is il/follible accord­
ing to an identical proposition; for no more can be demanded of
any man than that he faithfully follow his pure conviction. Now
since conscience expresses this conviction, it is always right for
every individual man at the given moment.
(HP P 2 1 4-2 15)
Cf. also:
The first law of the philosophical theory of virtue is the good
disposition of character: respect for the practical spirit. Correct­
ness of conviction in respect of the command is by contrast only
the second law. Hence the first rule by which I should compare
the actions of others with the duty of virtue must be distinguished
from the rule which tells me what duties are imposed on me. For
each can be judged only according to his own conviction, and
what it would be wrong to do according to a correct conviction
can for the individual be precisely what accords with duty.
(Fries, NKV III, 1 90)
If we wish to pass judgement upon the true worth of someone
else's life, we must remember that virtue is not the law. What is
important is not the fact that an externally virtuous action has
been performed but that virtue has been internally willed and
practised . . . If we now ask, 'What then is the good?' only the

43 1

educated understanding could give a correct reply. The decision
is no longer a matter of the will but of insight, so that here even
the purest and the best in earthly life could err and be mistaken.
(Fries, J E S 49izo, 55iz3)

14 Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (1743-1819) was an influential figure in

15

late eighteenth-century German philosophy. He was a critic of both
Enlightenment and German idealist rationalism, advocating a philo­
sophy of faith or intuition which had much in common with the views
of Fries which are under attack in P R § 140 (cf. V P G III, 419/5 I I).
For this very reason, however, Hegel is anxious to quote Jacobi
against Fries. Hegel criticized Jacobi in the 1802 essay Faith and
Knowledge, but in later years he and Jacobi were on good terms, and
Hegel's discussions ofJacobi in his later writings are generally favour­
able (cf. E L § § 61-78, V G P 3 15-329/410-423). Jacobi's remarks
refer to the conversion to Roman Catholicism of the poet Count
Friedrich Leopold von Stolberg (1750-1819), see § 141, note 1.
The most familiar form o f this saying is: 'To err i s human, t o forgive
divine' (Alexander Pope, Essay 011 Criticism 2.325). But Pope was
alluding either to the anonymous Latin proverb: Errare IltImatltl1l1 est,
or to Plutarch: 'For to err in opinion, though it be not the part of wise
men, is at least human' (A1orals: OfMatI 's Progress in Virtue. Against

Colotes).
16 Hegel is referring to the theory of irony put forward by Friedrich
Schlegel (1772-1829), chiefly in the Lyceum Fragments (Schlegel,
Kritische Allsgabe, ed. Ernst Behler, Jean-Jacques Anstett, and Hans
Eichner (Munich: Ferdinand Schoningh, 1957ff.), Volume II:
Characteristiken und Kritiken I (1966» . The classical definition of
irony is that of the Roman rhetorician Quintilian (c. A.D. 35�5): a
figure of speech in which 'what is to be understood is something
contrary to what is said' (Quintilian, Institutiones oratoriae 9.22.44).
Originally, the Greek term eLQOV{U meant 'dissemblance' or
'deception'; but through the life and image of Socrates, the consum­
mate ironist, its meaning was subtly transformed until 'irony' came to
signifY (as in Quintilian's later definition) not a dissemblance of one's
thought but a special way of expressing it by saying the opposite (see
Gregory VIastos, 'Socratic Irony', Classical Qparterly 37 (1987». As
Schlegel understands it, Socratic irony is the essence of artistic com­
munication: ' [In irony] everything should be both playful and serious,
both frank and obvious and yet deeply hidden' (Schlegel, Lycellm
Frag11le1lt 108). Irony for Schlegel is the form of communication best
suited to express a (pantheistic) religious consciousness of 'the
infinitely full chaos' whose ineffability makes its adequate expression

432

impossible in finite tenns (Idem § 69, Kritische Allsgabe II). 'Irony is, as
it were, the ostension (epideixis) of infinity, of universality, of the
feeling for the universe' (KritischeAllsgabe XVIII, 1 28). '[Socratic irony]
contains and arouses a feeling of the irresolvable conflict of the limit­
less and the limited, of the impossibility and the necessity of complete
communication' (Lyceum Fragmmt 108). ' [in irony there is] the mood
which surveys everything and rises infinitely above everything that is
limited, even above one's own art, virtue or genius' (Lyceum Fragmmt

42).

17

Hegel insists that Romantic irony is fundamentally different from
Socratic irony; he interprets Schlegel's concept of irony not as an
expression of the paradoxical human situation confronting the opposi­
tion of finite and infinite, but rather (invidiously) as an expression of
an extravagant, self-indulgent (even self-deifYing) subjectivism. He
regards , it as one of the (irrational, unserious, unphilosophical)
developments of Fichte's philosophy of the abstract subjective 'I'
(VG P III, 415-416/507-508). It was this Hegelian image of Schlegel
which Kierkegaard was both attacking in The Cot/cept of IrOtIY and
unfavourably portraying in Either[Or I; Schlegel's actual theory of
irony, however, seems quite close to the conception of 'indirect com­
munication' which Kierkegaard (through the pseudonym ofJohannes
Climacus) advocated in the Cot/cllldillg U11Scie1ltijic Postscript. Hegel
locates Schlegel at the extreme point where moral subjectivity is
transformed into evil; Hegel's and Kierkegaard's images of Schlegel
as libertine were always coloured by the associations of his scandalous
novel Lllcit/de (see below § 164, note I). However, Schlegel's portrait
of Hegelian philosophy was equally invidious, virtually the mirror
image of Hegel's portrait of him. For Schlegel, the Hegelian dialectic
was the self-deification of 'the spirit of denial': (see Ernst Behler,
'Friedrich Schlegel und Hegel', Hegel-Sttldim II (1963), p. 243. 'The
spirit of denial' (der Geist, der stets verneit/t) is of course
Mephistopheles' self-description, in Goethe, Fallst, Part I, line 1 338.)
According to Hegel's aesthetics lectures: 'It was Solger and Ludwig
Tieck who accepted irony as the highest principle of art' (VA I,
98/93). Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger (1780-1819) was Hegel's
colleague in philosophy in Berlin, whose speciality was the philosophy
of fine art, especially literature (though he also lectured on ethics and
political philosophy). Solger published a lengthy review of Schlegel's
reflections on irony in two parts, the first appearing in 1 809, the
second in 1 8 1 1 . (The text from which Hegel quotes has been
photographically reproduced in K. W. F. Solger, Erwill, ed. Wolfhart
Henckmann (Munich: Wilhelm Funk, 1971) (for the quoted pass­
ages, see pp. 407-409).) Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853) was a leading

PhG 'II 'II 733-743 ·
PhG '11'11 632-Q7 I . The notion of the 'beautiful soul' was common
among the Romantics (see § 13, note 2). It was derived from Schil­
ler's treatise all Grace alzd Digllity (I 793) and used by Goethe to refer
to the aunt of Natalie in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (1795) ('Con­
fessions of a Beautiful Soul', Goethe, Werke VII, ed. Erich Trunz
(Munich: Beck, I982), pp. 350, 358; cf. Iphigenie ill Tauris IV, ii, Werke
v, p. 48}. In his manuscripts of 1797, Hegel himself applies the term
(with wholly favourable connotations) to Christ (TJ 349-35 IIETW
234- 236). In PhG 'II 658, it is usually thought to refer to the poet
Friedrich von Hardenberg ('Novalis') (I772-I801). In Goethe,
Novalis, and PhG 'II 658 (but not in Schiller or in Hegel's early
writings), the term signifies a personality who shuns the active life,
since that might defile its inward purity. 'Beauty of soul' (but once
again without quietistic connotations) was later to be Fries's term for
the chief object of the moral life (HPP § I 9). See ]. Hyppolite, Genesis
alld StnlCtllre of Hegel's Phenomellology of Spirit (Evanston: North­
western University Press, I 974), pp. 5 1 2-5 17; and E. Hirsch, 'Die
Beisetzung der Romantiker in Hegels Ph1inomenologie', Deutsche
Vierteljahrssclzrijiflir LiterattmvisSetlschaji tmd Geistesgescllicllte 2 (I924),
pp. 5 1 0-532. In PhG as in P R, the dialectical inversion of conscience
into evil marks the limit of the moral sphere, and its transition into a
higher one. In P R this leads to (modern) ethi<;al life as the foundation
on which moral subjectivity rests. But in PhG, ethical life was treated
as the immediate stage of spirit and identified with ancient Greek
culture; morality was the outcome of the historical development which
began with ethical life. The discussion of conscience and evil thus led
instead to forgiveness and the reconciliation of spirit with itself in the
form of religion (phG '11 '11 672-Q83).
Hegel regards the Romantics generally as followers of Fichte, carry­
ing a one-sided subjectivistic interpretation of his philosophy to its
final extreme (see note IS above). Under this heading, Hegel includes
Friedrich Schlegel (I772-I 829), Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768I 834), Friedrich von Hardenberg ('Novalis') (I772-I80I}, ]. F. Fries

gott Krug (1770-1842). In Hegel's opinion, however, these Roman­
tics were not genuine philosophers at all; the first to make a genuine
advance beyond Fichte was F. W. J. Schelling (1775-1854) (VG P
415-420/506-5 1 2). The definitive discussion of Hegel's relation to
the Romantics is Otto Poggeler, Hegels Kritik der Romantik (Bonn:
Bouvier, 1956).

l One convert to Catholicism who caused consternation in Protestant
intellectual circles was Count Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg (see
§ 140, note 14). Several prominent German Romantics also con­
verted to Roman Catholicism; 'perhaps the most famous was Friedrich
Schlegel (see § 140, notes 16 and 2 I). The chief motivations of such
converts were a hostility to the Protestant de-sacralization of the
natural and social worlds, and a rejection of the rationalist ideals of
the French Revolution in favour of the security of a faith rooted in
institutional tradition and authority. According to some, Hegel him­
self may have briefly considered converting to Catholicism in 1804 for
such reasons (see Clark Butler (ed.), Hegel: 17ze Letters (Bloomington:
Indiana University Press, 1984), p. 8), but the outcome of this con­
sideration was apparently a reaffirmation of the very things from
which the converts to Catholicism wanted to flee.

3 See Aristotle, Nic011laclleatl Ethics 1 . I 3 . I I 02a-I I 03a, 2.6. I Io6a­
I I07b. In his lectures on the history of philosophy, Hegel has the
following to say about Aristotle's conception of virtue:
Aristotle determines the concept of virtue more precisely by
distinguishing a rational aspect of the soul from an irrational one;
in the latter nOlls [reason] is only dYllamei [potentially] - sensa­
tions, inclinations, passions, emotions apply to it. In the rational
side, understanding, wisdom, reflectiveness, knowledge
[Kellntllis] all have their place. But they do not constitute virtue,
which consists only in the unity of the rational with the irrational
side. We call it virtue when the passions (inclinations) are so
related to reason that they do what reason commands. If insight
(logos) is bad or not present at all but passion (inclination, the
heart) conducts itself well, then goodness of heart [Gllt11liitigkeit]
may exist, but not virtue, because the ground (logos, reason) or
11011S is lacking, which is necessary to virtue . . . Because the
virtues, considered as the unity of the desiring, actualizing ele­
ment with the rational element, have an alogical moment in them,
[Aristotle] posits their logos as a mean, so that virtue is a mean
between two extremes.

daughter of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn and wife of Berlin
banker Simon Veit. Late in that year, Dorothea left her husband,

obtaining a divorce in I799. In the summer of that year, Schlegel
published a novel Ll/ci1lde, chronicling the illicit relationship between
Lucinde and her lover Julius. The novel, especially in Julius'
somewhat didactic prologue, contains an attack on traditional sexual
mores, which condemns marriage without love as mere concubinage,
insists on the priority of personal love over public standards of social
respectability, blasts the unnatural hypocrisy of the prudery women
are expected to show in good society, and, perhaps most significantly,
criticizes the one-sidedness of prevailing moral ideals of masculinity
and femininity, insisting that for either sex a healthy personality and
successful love relationships are possible only if there is a harmonious
balance between the active impulses commonly attributed to the
masculine and the passive tendencies associated with the feminine.
Julius' attack on hypocrisy involves an explicit defence of his own
'effrontery' or 'impertinence' (Frechheit). (See Hans Eichner, Friedrich
Schlegel (New York: Twayne, I 970), Chapter 4.) Schlegel's views
were defended by the anonymous Letters 011 Schlegel's 'Ll/ci1lde' (1 800),
whose real author was the philosopher and theologian Friedrich
Schleiermacher. The real-life identities of Lucinde and Julius were
well known, and Luciude was ,videly regarded as obscene; its notoriety
followed Schlegel through life (even after he had become grotesquely
obese and reactionary). LI/ciude was a work far ahead of its time,
though by the standards of our day, LI/ciude is not sexually explicit and
Schlegel's ideas about love and sex no longer appear radical.

a wife was absent from her husband for three nights in a year, she
could avoid becoming an uxor in manti by remaining technically a part
of her birth family, remaining under her own father's patria potestas.
Her husband then acquired no right over her property and she was
tenned a matr01la rather than a materfomilias. Both modes of marriage
were considered legal, and coexisted into the era of later Roman law
(see Gaius, "ltlstillltes 1 . 136). The children of a matrona as well as a

1 The 'notion' in question is apparently Fichte's (GNR 3 67/467).
Contrary to what Hegel implies, however, it is not Fichte's doctrine
that a deceased person's children usually inherit because they happen
to be near by the property when it falls ownerless. Rather, Fichte
regards the state as 'the first proprietor' of such things (G N R
257/341); his aim is to give the state maximal discretion to determine
matters of inheritance as it sees fit.

1 This seems to be a reference to Fichte's actual doctrine, which does
indeed hold that the validity of a testamentary disposition is con­
tingent on its recognition by the state (G N R 256-257/340-341).
2 According to the Twelve Tables 4.2, a father has the right to sell his
children into slavery, and if they are manumitted, he has the power to
sell them again. However, after they are freed for a third time, they
cease to be under his patria potestas.

W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler (Oxford: Clarendon, 1 905), pp. 1 83201). Similar cases appear in the C01ltmversiae of Lucius Annaeus
Seneca (called Seneca 'the Elder' or 'the Rhetorician'), father of
Seneca the Roman philosopher.
7 In 46 B.C. Marcus Tullius Cicero divorced his wife Terentia and
married Publilia, who had been his ward, acquiring her considerable

Publilia also ended in divorce.

consul and founder of the Roman Republic, ordered his two sons

Titus and Tiberius to be beheaded before his eyes on account of their
conspiracy to restore the Tarquins to power (Livy, History of Rome
2.5). This right was affirmed in the Twelve Tables about fifty years
later. But it was modified in later Roman law, where the father was
permitted to inflict only moderate chastisement (Justinian, Codex
4.43 . 1); following a judgement of Constantine, a father who killed his
child could even be sentenced to the same punishment as a parricide
(Justinian, Codex 9.I7.I).

Schiller appears to equate the 'state of necessity' (Staat der Not) with
the 'natural state', which is 'based on force and not on laws'; this is
contrasted with the 'state of reason' or 'state of freedom', founded on
a 'moral unity'; the task of humanity is to exchange the state of
necessity for the state of freedom (Schiller Werke IV (Frankfurt: Insel,
1966), p. 202; Friedrich Schiller, Letters 011 the Aesthetic Educatioll of
Mati, tr. Reginald Snell (New York: Ungar, 1 965), Third and Fourth
Letters, pp. 29-34). Like Schiller, Fichte identifies the 'state of
necessity' with the existing state, and looks for a gradual progress
from it toward the 'rational state' (Fichte, S L 238-239125 1-252).
Hegel is perhaps implying that these thinkers have viewed the existing
state only in its relation to civil society, missing altogether the rational
state as it actually is.

§ 184

Plato, Republic 462a-e, argues that the ideal state should be like an
organism; when any one part is pleased or pained, the other parts
should share in it, and when one member of the state suffers or
rejoices, the whole should suffer or rejoice ,vith him. Hegel rejects
this application of the organic conception of the state, because it does
not provide for the principle of modernity, the principle of subjective
freedom, that each individual should have a separate and self­
determined life. See above, § 46, note 3, and below, § 1 85, notes 1-3.

posed to share wives and children (Republic 424a, 449C). Again, it is
only the guardian class about which Plato says this; neither private
property nor the family are excluded for the majority in Plato's state.
3 Plato's state is founded on the principle that all should do what they
are best fitted by nature to do (Republic 453b). This principle lies
behind the division of the state into rulers, auxiliaries, and farmers or
artisans. Within the guardian class, rulers are to be carefully selected
and trained from an early age (Republic 535a-537d); further, the
rulers are responsible for determining in which of the three classes a
child should be placed (Republic 415a-d). Beyond that, however, Plato
does not say how people are supposed to find the particular jobs they
are best suited to do, and he neither affirms nor denies that a person's
occupation should be a matter of choice for that person.

The Cynic school of philosophy was founded in Athens by Anti­
sthenes (born c. 440 B.C.), a pupil of Socrates. He taught that happi­
ness consists in virtue and in freedom from excessive desires. The
school's most famous representative was Antisthenes' pupil Diogenes
of Sinope (4th century B.C.), who lived for a time at Athens but was
buried in Corinth. He advocated, and practised, an extreme simplicity
in his manner of life; this, along with his blunt, witty contempt for his
fellow citizens, as well as for civilized life generally, made him the
subject of many amusing anecdotes. Cf. V G P J, 55 1-560/479-487.

1 Compare the following remarks from Hegel's Jena lectures:
In the machine, man abolishes his own formal activity and
makes [nature] work for him But this deception, which he
perpetrates on nature, takes vengeance on him The more he
takes from nature, the more he subjugates it, the baser he
becomes himself. By processing nature through a multitude of
machines, he does not abolish the necessity of his own labour; he
only pushes it further on, removes it from nature and ceases to
relate to it in a living way. Instead he flees from negative life, and
that work which is left to him becomes itself machine-like. The
amount of labour decreases only for the whole, not for the
individual; on the contrary, it is being increased, since the more
mechanized labour becomes, the less value it possesses, and the
OR I, 237)
more the individual must toil.
.

.

Through the work of the machine, the human being.becomes
more and more machine-like, dull, spiritless. The spiritual ele­
ment, the self-conscious plenitude of life, becomes empty
activity. The power of the self resides in rich comprehension: this
being lost. He can leave some work to the machine; his own doing
thus becomes even more formal. His dull work limits him to one
point, and labour is the more perfect, the more one-sided it is.

I When Hegel wrote this, the legal freedom to choose one's occupation

was only a little over a decade old in Prussia, and was still a matter of
controversy. The Pntssiml Ge1leral Legal Code of 1 794 still provided
that people were to belong to the estate into which they were born
(part I, Title I, § 6). This was altered through Stein's economic
reforms of 1 808, many of which were introduced by Theodor von
Schon (1 773-1856). Motivated by the free-trade doctrines of Adam
Smith and the German political economist Christian Jakob Kraus
(1 753-1 807), these reforms abolished serfdom and other hereditary
occupational restrictions, together with most guild monopolies. See

caste. Cf. VP G I 8o-I85ir44-148.

Dionysius I (430-367 B.C.), a man oflow birth, commanded the army
of the Syracusan republic against the Carthaginian invaders of Sicily
in 406. His campaign to drive them out was unsuccessful, but he
managed to make an unfavourable peace with them, and in 405 he
used his military command to establish himself as tyrant, ruling 4053 67. His son, Dionysius II (c. 3 95-343), ruled as tyrant from 367 until
3 57, when he was deposed by Dion, his uncle and his father's
sometime advisor. Dion hoped to re-establish a constitutional govern­
ment, but he was assassinated in 353, and Dionysius II ruled again
until 344. Plato's friendly relations with Dion - and his unsuccessful
attempts to reform the rule of Dionysius I and educate Dionysius II ':'
are the main subject of Plato's Epistles 3 , 7, and 8. Hegel's reference
to 'hanging the laws at such a height that no citizen could read them'
is, however, either obscure or misinformed; it is not even clear
whether he intends to refer to the father or the son.

Where it was introduced, the Code Napoleon is still

everything arising from the age of feudalism. (VP R I 9 1 72-173)

The following account of the 'equity court' is given by one legal
historian: 'Equity refers to the power of a judge to mitigate the harsh­
ness of a statute . . . Equity is, in other words, a limited grant of power
to the court to apply principles of fairness in resolving a dispute tried
before it' (J. H. Merryman, The Civil Law Tradition (Stanford: Stan­
ford University Press, 1 985), p. 49). Courts of equity, or 'chancery
courts' were an institution in English common law. Unlike Hegel,
Kant denied the legitimacy of such courts, on the ground that they
violate the republican principle of the separation of powers. It seemed
to him that a judge empowered to overrule the provisions of strict
justice according to the law was empowered to trespass on the proper
functions of the legislator (RL 233-235/39-41). Within the con­
tinental law tradition, the majority position on this issue was clearly
Kant's:
German law - like other continental laws - knows no parallel to
the two distinctions which are paramount in importance in
English law, i.e. the distinction between common law and equity
law and between case law and statute law. German has always
been one unified system of law in which there was and is neither
need nor room for a separate system of equity.
(E. J. Cohn, Matltlal ofGenl/at/ Law III (London: British Institute
of Comparative Law, 1 968), p. 3)
Thus Hegel's admission of courts of equity constitutes an (uncharac­
teristic) preference on his part for British legal institutions over con­
tinental ones.

§ 224
I

In the Prussia of Hegel's time, trials were not held in public.

§ 225
I

In the system of Roman law, there were two officials present at a trial:
the magistratus or magistrate, and the iudex or judge. A magistrate was

Notes to pages 255-258
a legal expert, whose task it was to prepare the aaio, or formulate the
legal question posed by the case. The judge was generally not an
expert in the law; it was his job to examine witnesses, determine the
facts, and rule on the case in accordance with the legal formula. The
pronouncement of a magistrate was called illS, while the decision of
the illdex was called the illdicillln. After 3 67 B.C., legal proceedings
were under the control of a new class of magistrates, called praetors. In
early Roman law, only a senator was eligible to be a imler, but with the
Gracchan reforms (see § 46, note I), the task of being a judge passed
to the Equestrian Order, a somewhat more numerous body of the
Roman nobility. (The Equestrians were so called because they
derived from an order of cavalrymen; but in later times they generally
had no military connections and were often merchants or financiers.)
After the demise of the Republic, eligibility to be a iudex was even
wider, extending even to some plebeians. The iudexwas usually selec­
ted by mutual agreement of the parties to a case; if they could not
agree, the illdex was chosen by lot from those eligible. Although in
legal matters the illdex was to act under the guidance of the
magistrate, Hegel is mistaken when he suggests that the authority of
the iudex was restricted to determining the facts of a case. Hegel's
depiction of the two roles is designed to provide a defence of his
recommendation that a trial should be presided over by a professional
judge, who leaves issues of fact to be decided by a jury.
2 See Blackstone, Commentaries IV, p. 333.

§ 227
I The formula in which a Roman iudex pronounced judgement was ex
animi sentelltia, meaning (in substance, if not literally) 'upon my con­
science and to the best of my belief.

§ 228
I Just as trials were not public in Hegel's Prussia (see § 224, note I) so
verdicts were always given by an appointed magistrate or judge. Trial
by jury was never part of the Prussian judicial system in Hegel's
lifetime. The jury system had earlier been advocated by Anselm
Feuerbach (see § 99, note 2), in Considerations ConcemingJury Courts
( 1 8 1 2). Under Napoleon's rule, jury courts were established in Mag­
deburg, Hanover, and Westphalia; but they were later abolished (see
Eduard Gans, Natttrrecht twd Universalrechtsgeschichte, ed. Manfred
Riedel (Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1 981), p. 89).

a. The Police
I Hegel uses the term 'police' (Polizez) in what seems to us a very broad
sense, defining the term as 'the state, in so far as it relates [siclz bezielzt]
to civil society' (VP RI 9 1 87); "'Police" is here the most suitable
name, even though in ordinary use it has a more limited significance'
(VP R IV, 587). The 'police' in this sense includes all the functions of
the state which support and regulate the activities of civil society with
a view to the welfare of individuals. Thus it includes public works (e.g.
highways, harbours, and waterways (VP R IV, 595)), all economic
regulatory agencies, and also what we would call the 'welfare' system.
In 1 820, however, this broad meaning of Polizei was not in the least
technical or idiosyncratic. The word in German originally had the
broad meaning Hegel gives it, and in the Pmssiall Get/eral Legal Code
of 1 794, Polizei includes building regulation, fire protection, public
health, and relief for the poor. As a consequence, the term Polizeistaat
was used by Fichte with no derogatory connotations whatever (also
occasionally by Hegel with positive connotations). (For Germans of
Hegel's day, the meaning of Polizeistaat was perhaps closer to our
term 'welfare state' than to our term 'police state'.) Only later in the
nineteenth century was the meaning of Polizei limited to the main­
tenance of peace and order, 'law enforcement' in a narrower sense
(see G. C. von Unruh, 'Polizei, Polizeiwissenschaft und
Kameralistik', in K. G. A. Jeserich, Hans Pohl, and G. C. von Unruh
(eds.) Dezlfsclze Venvalttmgsgesclziclzte I (Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlagsan­
stah, 1983), pp. 388-427). In several places, Hegel emphasizes the
derivation of the word Polizei from the Greek politeia ('constitution')
along with differences between ancient Greek and modem constitu­
tions which derive from the modem principle of subjective freedom
(VPRI7 III, 259, 266, V P R IV, 587; cf. also Fichte, G N R 292303/374-387, and Hegel's criticisms of him in VPR19 152, V P R IV,
1 90-1 9 1 , 6 1 7, VPR17 139).

§ 234
I

Obviously, Hegel's view that no sharp line can be drawn between
legitimate and illegitimate state interference with individuals is not
equivalent to the view that any form of state interference can be
justified. Hegel insists that individual freedom from state interference
(which he calls 'civil freedom'), along with the freedom to participate
in the state (which he calls 'political freedom') are both essential to the
health of the economy and the state (VP R I 7 140-141). For this
450

Notes to pages 26I-264
reason, he attacks Fichte's insistence that the police should have a
right to know at all times who each person on the public streefis, and
what business he is about (GN R 298/378):
Fichte's whole state is police . . . The police should know of
each citizen what he is doing every moment, where he is, but of
course his inner life is not to be inspected. If someone buys a
knife, the police have to know why, and then follow him around to
prevent his stabbing someone to death. A traveller is immediately
suspicious, and it is not enough to legitimate him that he have a
pass or a mere identity card, the pass has to be his portrait.
(VP R IV, 6 1 7)
Hegel insists that, to be consistent, in Fichte's state the police them­
selves would have to be overseen, leading to an infinite regress of
police spies. The only solution, he says, is that 'the universal should
be essentially not external but an inward, immanent end, the activity
of individuals themselves' (VP R IV, 6 1 7). Both Fichte and Hegel
insist that the police have no right to enter private dwellings without a
special order 'for the internal doings of the family should be unob­
served' (VP R17 138; cf. Fichte, G N R 240-242/3 22-324). Hegel
thinks that the police ought not to make its presence obvious: 'It is
something equally obnoxious when one sees police officers
everywhere . . . But [even] the hidden [activities] of the police must
have the end that public life should be free' (VP R I 7 1 3 9). Again
agreeing with Fichte (GN R 303/386-387), Hegel criticizes the
British institution of police spies (VP R I 7 139).

§ 240
I 'Amasis [of Egypt] established an admirable custom, which Solon
borrowed and introduced at Athens, where it is still preserved; this
was that every man once a year should declare before the Nomarch, or
provincial governor, the source of his livelihood; failure to do this, or
inability to prove that the source was an honest one, was punishable by
death' (Herodotus, T7ze Histories 2 . 1 77, tr. Aubrey de Selincourt
(Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1 954), pp. 1 7 1-1 72). Even before
600 B.C., an Athenian citizen was enfranchised at maturity by being
45 1

Notes to pages 264-266
admitted either to a 'clan' (gene) or a 'guild' (orgeones). Clan member­
ship involved his family's (inalienable) property rights over land, and
signified that the citizen lived by agriculture. Guild membership
signified the citizen's admission to a definite trade or handicraft.
These economic provisions formed the basis of the legal and constitu­
tional reforms of Solon and Cleisthenes (see N. G. L. Hammond, A
History of Greece (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1 967), pp. 1 53-154). In
Fichte's political theory, all citizens are also required to give an
account of their livelihood to the state (GNR § 1 8,
2 1 0-2 1 51289-295).

§ 242
1 Compare the following remark from Hegel's Heidelberg lectures of
1 8 1 7-18 1 8:
The beneficent person has the intention of helping others, and
this depends on his arbitrary will . But in this system of mediation,
those who care for themselves also care for others. He who pays
out his money for his needs, gives others his money, but makes it
a condition of this that they do their duty, that they be
industrious, and so he gives them a more correct feeling of self
than the one who gives his money to the poor; for the poor man
who receives alms does not have a feeling of independence . . . In
general, the state must prevent general distress through its
arrangements. A subjective distress can arise, whereby a person's
disposition is helped through advice and deed; but it is better if
the state cares for the needs of the individual . . . Subjective
helping of the poor must be minimized as much as possible,
because giving subjective help, instead of being useful, can do
harm.
(VP RI 7 1 25)

§ 243
1 Hegel distinguishes an 'estate' (Statui) from a 'class' (Klasse):
The different estates of a state are in general concrete distinc­
tions, according to which the individuals are divided into classes;
classes rest chiefly on the inequality of wealth, upbringing, and
education, just as these again rest on inequality of birth, through
which some individuals receive a kind of activity which is more
useful for the state than that received by others.

Notes to page 267
§ 244
1 The problem of poverty in modern civil society plainly disturbed
Hegel greatly, and led to thoughts which are not easily reconciled with
his generally optimistic attitude toward the ethical prospects of
modern civil society. Consider the following remarks from his lec­
tures of 1 8 1 9-1820:
The emergence of poverty is in general a consequence of civil
society, and on the whole it arises necessarily out of it . . . Poverty
is a condition in civil society which is unhappy and forsaken on all
sides. The poor are burdened not only by external distress, but
also by moral degradation. The poor are for the most part
deprived of the consolation of religion; they cannot visit church
often, because they have no suitable clothing or must work on
Sundays. Further, they must participate in a worship which is
chiefly designed for an educated audience. In this connection,
Christ said that the Gospel is preached for the poor . . . Equally,
the enjoyment of the administration of justice is often made very
difficult for them. Their medical care is usually very bad. Even if
they receive treatment for actual illnesses, they lack the means
necessary for the preservation and care of their health . . .
The poor are subject to yet another division, a division of
emotion [Gemiit] between them and civil society. The poor man
feels excluded and mocked by everyone, and this necessarily gives
rise to an inner indignation. He is conscious of himself as an
infinite, free being, and thus arises the demand that his external
existence should correspond to this consciousness. In civil society
it is not only natural distress against which the poor man has to
struggle. The poor man is opposed not only by nature, a mere
being, but also by my will. The poor man feels as if he were
related to an arbitrary will, to human contingency, and in the last
analysis what makes him indignant is that he is put into this state
of division through an arbitrary will. Self-consciousness appears
driven to the point where it no longer has any rights, where
freedom has no existence. In this position, where the existence of
freedom becomes something wholly contingent, inner indigna­
tion is necessary. Because the individual's freedom has no
existence, the recognition of universal freedom disappears. From
this condition arises that shamelessness that we find in the rabble.
A rabble arises chiefly in a developed civil society . . .
Earlier we considered the right of distress [P R § 1 27] as some­
thing referring to a momentary need. Here distress no longer has
merely this momentary character. In the emergence of poverty,
453

T"
Notes to pages 267-271
the power of particularity comes into existence in opposition to
the reality of freedom. That can produce the negatively infinite
judgement of the criminal. Of course crime can be punished, but
this punishment is only contingent . . . On the one hand, poverty
is the ground of the rabble-mentality, the non-recognition of
right; on the other hand, the rabble disposition also appears
where there is wealth. The rich man thinks that he can buy
anything, because he knows himself as the power of the particu­
larity of self-consciousness. Thus wealth can lead to the same
mockery and shamelessness that we find in the poor rabble. The
disposition of the master over the slave is the same as that of the
slave . . . These two sides, poverty and wealth, thus constitute the
corruption of civil society.

the same trade or profession, but any society which is officially
recognized by the state but is not itself a part of the political state.

2 On the basis of their firm belief in the principle of freedom of enter­
prise, Stein proposed, and Hardenberg carried into effect (through
the edicts ob November 1 8 1 0 and 7 September 1 8 1 2), the abolition
of guild monopolies (see Meinecke, The Age oJGen1/all Liberatioll, pp.
86-88, and Max Braubach, VOII der jrallziisisc/lm Revoilltioll bis zllm
Wimer KOllgrejl (Stuttgart: Klett, 1974), Chapter 1 7). Though he
approves of the abolition of 'the miserable guild system', Hegel plainly
has mixed feelings about this development:
The natural difference between social estates [Stallde] must not
remain merely natural, but must also exist as a universal, so that it
can be recognized as a universal. Each in his civil existence (as
bOllrgeois) must belong to a determinate estate [Statui]. But it must
first be determined whether he has the skill and resources for it.
These estates, which at first refer only to needs, must become
firm corporations. The rational aspect of corporations is that the
common interest, this universal, actually exists in a determinate
form. According to the principle of atomicity, each cares merely
for himself and does not concern himself about anything in com­
mon; it is left to each whether he is destined for a certain social
estate, without considering the utility of his choice from a political
point of view; since, according to those who want it this way,
someone whose work no one approves will go into another trade
on his own. This principle [of atomicity] gives such a person over
to contingency. Our standpoint of reflection, this spirit of atom­
icity, this spirit of finding your honour in your individuality and
not in what is common - this is destructive, and has caused the
(VP R 1 7 142-143)
corporations to fall to pieces.

4 In the Holy Roman Empire there evolved during the Middle Ages the
institution of the Reidlstag or Imperial Diet, a council composed
exclusively of the nobility, whose function was to advise the emperor.
In the thirteenth century it contained two houses, the C.ouncil of
Electors and the Council of Greater Princes. The so-called Golden
Bull of 1356 empowered the Archbishop of Mainz to call the Estates.
In 1 489 the Imperial Diet came to include representatives of the free
imperial cities. It was now organized into three colleges or ClIriae,
known as the 'imperial Estates' (Reidlsstiblde): (I) the six electors (who
chose the emperor); (2) the princes, including prelates, counts, and
lords; and (3) municipal representatives of the free cities. See J.
Zophy (ed.) TIle Holy Romall Empire (Westport, CT: Greenwood
Press, 1980), pp. 108-109. During the eighteenth century there were
such Estates assemblies or diets in many of the German states. Like
the Imperial Estates they were composed not of elected representa­
tives but of certain members of the nobility and officials from the
larger municipalities. Hegel is attempting to see such institutions as
precedents for a modern system of representation; in fact, the diets
were usually anything but progressive institutions. They often
defended their members' own entrenched privileges simultaneously
against the centralized sovereign power and against the aspirations of
the wider population for political participation. In Hegel's home state
of Wiirttemberg, it was such an assembly that in 1 8 1 6 turned down
the king's proposal for a new and comparatively progressive constitu­
tion, including genuine representative institutions. Hegel, who
favoured the king's proposal, was highly critical of the diet and its
fixation on the 'good old law' (L W 493-5°8127 1-284).
5 At Runnymede in 1 2 1 5 the English barons compelled King John to
sign a document guaranteeing baronial privileges against royal incur­
sion. Later, after concluding favourable negotiations with the papal
legate Cardinal Pandulph, John succeeded, with papal support, in
repudiating the agreement. Subsequent tradition, however, has
viewed the Magna Charta as one of the most important documents in
English constitutional history, establishing the principle of the
supremacy of constitution over king.

the expulsion of the Stuart monarchy, recognized certain civil and
political rights of British citizens, and established the political
supremacy of Parliament.
7 The Pmssiall General Legal Code of 1 794 was viewed by many, includ­
ing Hegel, as an important part of the legacy of Frederick the Great
and the Enlightenment: 'Frederick II deserves special mention here,
because he grasped in thought the universal end of the state . . . His
immortal work was the domestic legal code - the [Prussian] General
Code' (VP G 523/441). (Though Frederick died in 1 786, the project
of legal codification had been initiated by hinI.) For the same reason,
the General Code was a common object of attack by Romantic reac­
tionaries, including Haller and Savigny.

Christian principles, as well as for the protection of traditional
Christian values against the impious and subversive tendencies of
modem times, such as those leading to the French Revolution and the
Napoleonic empire.

I In 503 B.C., a section of the Roman plebeians seceded from the city in
protest against patrician privileges. Menenius Agrippa, consul of
Rome, is supposed to have persuaded them to return, by telling them
a fable: All the members of the body rebel against the belly, accusing
it ofliving idly off their labours; the belly replies that they receive their
food only through it. Menenius Agrippa likens the Roman Senate to
the belly, and the rebellious plebeians to the members. The original
source for this fable is Livy, History ofRome 1 .2.32, but it is probably
best known in Shakespeare's version, Coriolallus I.i.93-I 5 1 . Hegel
also refers to this fable elsewhere (VPG I SiS; V A III, 3 68/IV, 148).

None of these appear to be direct quotations from anyone. The best
known saying expressing a similar idea is St Augustine's Dilige et quod
vis foc, 'Love and do what you want to' (St Augustine, fll epistolam
foamlis tractatus 7.8). Hegel himself, in the manuscripts of his Frank­
furt period, maintained (in opposition to what he regarded as the
spirit of both Judaism and Kantian morality) that Jesus' religion of
love transcends and abolishes both duty and the law (TJ 3243 26IETW 2 1 3-2 1 5).
5 This is another polemic against Fries, whose ethics of conviction (see
§ 140, note 1 2) was often given a religious setting.
6 In Hegel's time there was no military conscription in Prussia (see
below § 27 I, note 2). But after it was introduced later in the
nineteenth century, religious objections to military service were
recognized there, until the time of the Franco-Prussian War.
7 Mter 1 8 1 5 , there was a resurgence of anti-Semitism in many quarters
(not least among the liberal German nationalist \ving of the student
Burscllellsclzafiell). More specifically, the 'viewpoint' criticized here is
probably that of Hegel's enemy Fries, in his vicious pamphlet of r 8 r6:
Jews can be subjects of our government, but as Jews they can
never become citizells of our people, for as Jews they want to be a
distinct people, and so they necessarily separate themselves from
our German national community. Indeed, they form not merely a
people, but at the same time they form a state. The basic laws of
Jewish religion are at the same time the basic laws of their state,

Notes to pages 296-300
their rabbis are at the same time their chiefs, to whom the people
owe the highest reverence and the most blind obedience . . .
Their nationality signifies in itself only their physical origin
from a distinct people. Here we have to judge them as favourably
as possible. No man who loves justice wants to stand by the
proposition that black is the colour of slaves, or any other prop­
osition of that kind. In every civilized state, the same innate rights
of a free man, equal protection and equal civil rights, pertain to
everyone, whether by origin a Saxon, Wend, or Jew. But let us
observe that we may not concede these same innate rights to
anyone ifhe is not ready to fulfil to the state in full measure all the
duties of a free man and a citizen. And here, even disregarding
religion, state, and trade, and considering their mere derivation,
we encounter the first great failing of Jewishness. They have
existed for millennia between all other peoples on the earth, and
they have cultivated themselves only in becoming rich through
bargaining and haggling; they teach this to one another and that is
how they preserve the purity of their race . . .
It is not against the Jews, our brothers, but against Jewis/mess,
that we declare war . . . Jewis/mess is a relic of an earlier,
uncivilized age, which must not be merely limited, but wholly
extirpated. To improve the civil condition of the Jews would be
precisely to extirpate Jewr)" to destroy the society of conniving
second-hand street peddlers and tradesmen . . . For the Jews
themselves it is of the greatest importance thatJewishness should
be made an end of as soon as possible . . .
So the Jewish caste, wherever it has been admitted, has always
had over the whole people, above and below, from the highest to
the lowest, a frightful demoralizing power. Here is the most
important moment of this whole affair: that this caste shollid be

extirpated root a1ld bra1lch, si1lce of all societies a1ld states, secret or
pllblic, it is plai1l/y the most da1lgerolls to the state.

8 This is a reference to Chancellor Hardenberg's 'Edict Concerning
the Civil Relations of the Jews' (I I March 1 8 1 2), which declared that
Jews were to enjoy full equality of civil and political rights in Prussia.

earth moves about the sun in his Dialoglle 011 the Two Chief World
Systems (1632). In 1634 he was called before the Court of the Inquisi­
tion and compelled to abjure his doctrine that the earth moves, which
had been declared heretical in 1 6 1 6. With all due deliberate speed in
righting the Church's past wrongs, Pope John Paul II reversed the
Church's condemnation of the Copernican theory in 1 979, admitting
that the Church had done GaliIeo an injustice. Hegel's mention of the
cases of Bruno and GaliIeo may have been occasioned in part by the
Roman Church's re-establishment of the Inquisition in both Italy and
Spain in 18 14.
1 2 In the concluding section of his treatise Sigllatllr des Zeitalters
(Sigllatllre of the Age) (1820-1 823), Friedrich Schlegel praises the
thinkers of his age who have variously propounded and defended the
idea of a 'Christian state, with an absolute monarchical constitution,
founded on the institution of the Church' (Friedrich Schlegel Kritische
Atlsgabe VII, p. 561); this seems to be the idea of the 'unification of
Church and state' which Hegel has in mind. Schlegel gives chief
credit for developing this idea to Adam Mi.iller (1 779-1829), Elemet1te
der Staatskll11st (Berlin: Sander, 1809); others he especially credits are:
Louis Gabriel Ambroise, Vicomte Bonald (1754-1 840), Karl Ludwig
von Haller, Joseph Gorres (1776-1848), and Joseph deMaistre
(1753-182 1).
13 Cf. Aristotle, Politics 1.2. 1 253a: 'The city has priority over the house­
hold and over any individual, for the whole must be prior to the parts.
Separate a hand or foot from the whole body and they will no longer
be a hand or a foot - except in name, as one might speak of a hand or
foot sculptured in stone.'

§ 271
1 Under the Roman Republic, it was customary for a general to have a
personal bodyguard, made up of his friends and clients, called his
'praetorians' (from praetorillm, a Roman army headquarters). Later
these private armies grew in size and consisted largely of mercenaries.
The resulting system of private armies turned the de facto govern­
ment of Rome more and more into a military dictatorship, leading to
the fall of the Republic and the transition to the Empire, whose rulers
often became emperor through their positions of military command.
2 Mter its humiliating defeat by the French in 1806, the Prussian army
was reorganized under Stein's reforms. The directors of the military
reforms were August GrafNeidhart von Gneisenau (1 760-183 1) and
Gerhard von Scharnhorst (1 755-1 8 13). The plan of the reformers
was to end the nobility's exclusive privileges in the officer corps, and

1

T

Notes to pages 305-309
replace an army of mercenaries with a 'citizen army' for which all
adult males would be eligible. A system of conscription was to be
instituted, and at least minimal military training was to be provided (as
Scharnhorst colourfully put it) for 'anyone who can piss against a
wall'. The conservative nobility prevented these plans from being
carried out, but the political values which lay behind them would
naturally be endorsed by those (such as Hegel and Gans) who shared
the goals of the reform era. (See Friedrich Meinecke, 17ze Age oj
Gem/all Liberatioll IJ9S-18IS (1 906), tr. Peter Paret (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1 977), Chapter 5; and Constantin de

1 This is evidently another reference to Fries, whose treatise The Ger­
mall Federatioll alld Genllall COllstitlltioll advocated 'a pure German
Federal state' in the form of 'a republican union' of all German­
speaking peoples (Fries, D B S 1, 1 67-168, cf. II, I I 2).
2 Kant (RL § 49, 3 1 6-3 1 8/81-84) regarded the separation of execu­
tive and legislative powers as the fundamental principle of a republi­
can form of government. The originator of the idea of separation of
powers, however, was the constitutional monarchist Montesquieu (see
The Spirit ojthe Laws I, 1 1 .6).
3 Universality, particularity, and individuality are the three moments of
the concept in Hegel's speculative logic (WL VI, 273-300/600-62 1 ;
E L § § 1 63-165) .
4 The French Revolution of 1 789, as well as the English Civil War of
1 640, involved conflicts between the Crown (the executive) and the
Parliament or Estates (the legislative).

1 In place of Montesquieu's division of governmental powers into
executive, legislative, and judiciary, Hegel constructs his division on
the three moments of the concept (see above § 272, notes 2 and 3).
2 For this taxonomy of constitutions, see Aristotle, Politics 3 .7.1 279a
and Montesquieu, The Spirit oJthe Laws I, 3.

within the state. His solution to this dilemma is to de\1se an institution
which he called the 'ephorate'. The ephors ('overseers') are to be a
group of the oldest and \\1sest citizens, chosen by the people. They
are to have no governmental power themselves, but they are
empowered to dissolve the government at any time and call a conven­
tion of the people to sit in judgement on those who had been in charge
of it (Fichte G N R 1 66--1 781253-271).

Despite his general advocacy of written, codified laws (see P R
§§ 2 I I-2 I 8), in P R Hegel is silent on the question of whether the
constitution should be written. In 1 8 1 7 Hegel was a supporter of the
king's plan for a written constitution in his home state of Wiirttem­
berg, and criticized those who prevented the plan from being adopted
(see L W). In Prussia, too, the issue of a written constitution had been
raised. In 1 8 10, and again in 1 8 15, Friedrich Wilhelm III promised in
writing that he would draw up a written constitution. In 1 8 1 9 both
Hardenberg and Humboldt drew up constitutional plans (which,
especially in their pro\1sions for representative government, both fol­
low the earlier plans de\1sed by Stein and bear a striking resemblance
to the political system described in P R). In 1 8 1 9 conservatives gained
ascendancy over the reformers (see Preface, note 1 8), Humboldt was
dismissed and the king's promises for a written constitution (which
were opposed by the conservatives) were never fulfilled. Hegel's pro­
nouncements in his lectures on the relation of the constitution to
written law and to the legislative power are various and not easily
reconciled \\1th each other. Some suggest that the constitution is
something beyond written law, and which must always remain so:
'The constitution itself lies outside the legislative power; but in the
development of the laws lies also the development of the constitution'
(VP R I 9 259). In other places, however, the constitution is spoken of
along with the laws, as one moment of the state:
In the concept of the state three moments are contained: [ I ]
the universal, rational will, partly a s the constitution and the laws
of the constitution, partly as the laws in the genuine sense - the
constitution itself and the legislative power; [2] . . . the govern­
(VP RI 7 I S I)
mental power; [3] . . . the sovereign power.

1 Napoleon expelled the Bourbons from Spain in 1808 and established
his brother Joseph Bonaparte as Spanish monarch under the Con­
stitution of Bayonne. Devised according to Jacobin principles, this
constitution gave the king very little power, completely disenfran­
chised the clergy, and invested chief authority in the Cortes (or
Estates), from which the royal ministers were barred (see § 300, note
1). The Constitution of Bayonne was extremely unpopular: the
Spaniards had no experience with representative institutions, and no
politically educated middle class; they resented the imposition of
French ideas on them; they were disoriented by the absence of royal
authority in their political life and outraged by the exclusion of the
Church from all political influence. Largely through British naval
power, the French were driven out of Spain in 18 1 2-1 8 13; the Cortes
formulated the equally liberal Constitution of Cadiz, but it was no
more favourably received than the Constitution of Bayonne had been,
and never really took effect. When the Bourbon King Ferdinand VII
was restored in 1 8 1 4, the people are said to have greeted the event
with cries of 'Long live the absolute King!' and 'Down with the
Constitution!' It is revealing of Hegel's general political orientation
that he regards the Constitution of Bayonne as inherendy rational and
ascribes its failure solely to the political immaturity of the Spanish
nation.

I Under feudal institutions, which still existed in many German states
at the end of the eighteenth century, some state functions (e.g. a
military command, a magistracy or local administrative authority over
a certain territory) were the hereditary property of a noble family. The
administrative and military reorganization of the Prussian state under

Notes to pages 314-323
Stein abolished such functions, replacing them with civil servants
appointed by the king. This was achieved chiefly by doing away ,vith
the system in which the departments of government were divided
along regional lines, and put in the hands of local administrators,
replacing it ,vith a system of ministries ,vith nationwide responsibility
for specific departments of government (see § 289). The idea that all
offices in the state, including that of the sovereign, are private prop­
erty, was one of the basic principles of Haller's theory of the state (see
Preface, note 15 and § 258, note 3). He maintained that the
fundamental error of the Pmssiall General Legal Code of 1 794 was
Frederick the Great's erroneous Enlightenment notion that state offi­
cials are 'servants of the state' whose functions are public rather than
private property (Haller, Res/aura/ioll I, pp. 1 8 1-1 85).

2 Compare the following remarks from Hegel's Heidelberg lectures of
1 8 17-1 8 1 8 and his Berlin lectures of 1 8 1 9-1 820: 'The monarch acts
only as a subject, and only what is objective in an action can be
justified. Hence he is not [to be held] responsible' (VP R I 7 164).
Laws and institutions are something in and for themselves, and
the monarch does not decide them . . . The responsibility can fall
only on the ministers. To be responsible means that actions must
be according to the constitution and so on. This objective side
pertains to the ministers. The majesty of the monarch is not at all
to be held responsible for the actions of the government . . . It is
the government which must always finally take up [the people's]
thoughts about improving things.
(VP R I 9 252-253, 246)
These quotations echo the words of Article 13 of the French 'Charte

Notes to pages 323-325
constitutionelle' of I 8 I 5 : 'The person of the king is inviolable and
sacred. His ministers are responsible' O. Godechot, Les Constitutions
de la France depllis IJ89 (Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, I 970), p. 2 I 9).
This provision was understood in one way by the ultra-royalists and in
another by constitutionalists. The ultras took it to mean that the
ministers are responsible to the king, and the king is utterly inviolable,
responsible to no one (but God). Constitutionalists, such as Benjamin
Constant (I 767-I830), Victor Cousin (I 792-I867), Pierre Royer­
Collard (1 763-1 845), and Fran<;ois Guizot (I787-I 874), interpreted
it as meaning that the ministers are responsible to the people, and that
since they are, the substantive decision-making powers ought to lie
with them; that, in their view, is the price the royalists must pay for the
inviolability of the king. Here Hegel is expressing agreement with the
constitutionalist interpretation of the principle of sovereign-imiol­
ability and executive-responsibility.

I In Hegel's time, the notion of elective monarchy was associated ,vith
the institution of the Holy Roman Emperor, who was chosen by a
college of sb: electors, whose positions were hereditary. Hegel is
probably also thinking of the elective monarchy in Poland (VP RI9
247; VPG 5 I 7/427)·
2 The motto of Fries's The Gennan Federatioll and Gennan Constill/lion
( 1 8 1 6) was: 'Frederick [the Great] alone appeared and from the
throne declared the sovereign to be the first sen'ant of the state'
(Fries, D B S 2). Fries was quoting from August Ludwig Schlozer
( 1 735-1 8°9), Allgemeil/e Staatsredlts- lllld Staatsverjassllllgslehre (Got­
tingen: Vandenhoek & Ruprecht, I 793), p. 29, but Frederick's
remark was famous and often quoted (e.g. by Kant, EF 352lrOI).
Hegel denies that 'first servant' is an appropriate title for the
sovereign (VP R I 9 248).
3 See, for example, above PR §§ I 82-I 89.
4 The weakness of the Holy Roman Empire was treated by Hegel in his
early untitled manuscript now customarily called 'The German Con­

electors for the Holy Roman Empire. From the time of the election of
Charles V in 15 I9, the emperor had to agree to an 'electoral contract',
which involved recognizing the electors' proprietary right in certain
offices.

all disease also comes from him. Does that mean that it is forbidden to

6 After his victories over Prussia and Austria, Napoleon met Tsar Alex­
ander I at Erfurt in October r 808. Representatives of a number of the
conquered German states attended, in the hope of gaining conces­
sions from him by adopting the position of dutiful subjects petitioning
their sovereign. The quoted remark indicates the manner in which
Napoleon rebuffed them.

§ 283
r Compare the foIlowing remarks from Hegel's Heidelberg lectures of
r 8 r 7-r8r8:
The ministers must be chosen by the sovereign, and he also
has to choose all the other officials, but he can arbitrarily dismiss
only the former . . . [But] the guarantee of the Estates of the realm
in particular requires the monarch to take up suitable subjects,
and requires that the ministers be chosen on the basis of talent,
virtue, rectitude, and diligence. The Prince Regent [of England,
later King George IV, governing during the incompetency of his
father George III] who had his friends in the opposition party and
his enemies in the ministry, could not, when he took up the
regency, make his friends into ministers. Hence the French
ministry [in r 8 r 7 under King Louis XVIII] is made up of
enemies of the royal family, the ultra-royalists. These examples
show that the choice of ministers in a well-constituted monarchy
is not a matter of the mere arbitrary will of the regent.

Notes to pages 329-331

I Here Hegel follows Stein's reforms of I 807-I808, which created
local government by municipal councils:
Local administration was to be the sphere of self-government
and elected officials. This innovation could be based on the
exjsting administration of the rural district [Lalldkreis]; [that
administrator] was a representative of - and nominated by - the
county Estates, and [was] simultaneously a state official by royal
appointment.
(Friedrich IVleinecke, The Age oj Gemzall Liberatioll, 1795-1&5
(I 906), p. 74 [English translation amended])

I Again, Hegel's executive is structured according to Stein's reforms:
Stein demanded the replacement of cabinet government by a
ministerial system. He wanted the Council of Ministers to work
directly with the king so that major decisions were no longer
made in the monarch's office but in council. It is no exaggeration
to regard Stein's proposals as a revolt of the senior bureaucracy
against the autocratic absolutism in power until then, as a
preparation for the eventual transition from absolute to constitu­
tional monarchy . . . He introduced another fundamental change
in the position of the ministers: they no longer administered
separate provinces but were now responsible for departments that
covered the entire state . . . Departmental ministries were
established for interior affairs, finance, foreign affairs, war and
justice.
(Ivleinecke, The Age oJGenl/all Liberatioll, pp. 70-72)
2 This is an allusion to Hobbes's description of the state of nature as a
'war of all against all' (Leviathan I, Ch. I 3 ; De cive, Preface).

I See § 288, note I and § 289, note I .
2 Elsewhere Hegel also criticizes the French system in which local
officials are appointed by the central government (VP G 537/454).

Notes to pages 332-337

§ 291
I

During Hegel's lifetime, the ministry and highest levels of the civil
service and the military were open only to the nobility. Hegel appears
to have accepted this situation in some of his early writings (cf. NR
489/99-100). Stein attempted to reform this system, making
everyone legally eligible for all state offices; but his proposals were
successfully resisted by the nobility. In P R, Hegel evidently favours
Stein's plan. In his lectures, Hegel indicates that the 'objective quali­
fications' are to be determined by examinations: 'The only condition
of entry into the universal estate is the proof of one's capacity. Hence
examinations must be arranged, in order to prove this capacity'
(V P R I 7 17 1).

§ 294
I

This closely follows the Pntssiall Gelleral Legal Code's provisions for
the rights and duties of civil servants (Part 2, Title 1 0).

§ 295
I

This is an allusion to the celebrated legal battle involving Arnold the
Miller of Ziillichau. The Miller was unable to pay his rent after the
Count von Schmettau cut off the water to his mill in order to build a
fish pond. For several years the Miller was denied justice, until
Frederick the Great himself heard his case. He found in the Miller's
favour and dismissed three magistrates who had earlier ruled against
the Miller.

§ 298
I

This change was effected in the Pntssiall Gl?1leral Legal Code, Part 2,
Title 14, § 1 1 . Through an executive order of 1 820 the lands were
used as collateral for state debt.
2 Before 1495, the Holy Rom"an Emperor dispensed justice personally
through the Imperial Court of Justice (Reicllslzo./kericlll). In that year
the imperial reform movement, led by Archbishop Berthold von Hen­
neberg of Mainz (1484-1504) created the Imperial Cameral Court
(Reiclzskallllllergericlzt), controlled not by the Emperor Maximilian I
(reigned 1 493-1 5 1 9) but by the Imperial Estates (see § 258, note 4).
The emperor appointed the chief justice and two presidents, but
sb:teen associate justices were nominated by the Imperial Estates. By

Notes to pages 337-340
1 648 these associate justices had gro.wn to over fifty in number (see ].
Zophy (ed.) The Hob' Romall Empire, pp. 23 2-234).

§ 299
I Such provisions were still included in the Pmssiall Gmeral Legal Code
of 1 794: 'Through investiture the vassal assumes the duty of fealty to
the chief proprietor, and the services or other obligations bound up
with the possession of the fief (part I, Title 18, § 143).

§ 300
I Members of the executive were excluded from all legislative functions
according to Section 3, § 4 of the French revolutionary constitution of
1 7 9 1 . The rationale for this was Rousseau's insistence that the
government, or executive power, which applies the laws to particular
cases, should be distinct from the sovereign - the people (or, as the
revolutionaries interpreted it, their representatives) - who makes the
laws (Social COlltract III, Ch. I). Hegel intends the executive to have a
share in legislation, not by themselves being members of the Estates
(after the English model), but instead by advising on and proposing
laws. The Estates, on the other hand, are to be the legislative province
exclusively of the private estate (see § 303). In the constitutional
proposals for Wtirttemberg, which Hegel favoured, the Crown
(through the executive) was to initiate all legislative proposals, but the
Estates were to have the power of veto over all legislation affecting
personal freedom or property or the constitution; the Estates might,
however, submit legislative proposals to the Crown, and if the pro­
posals were rejected, the Crown would have to give reasons for the
rejection (L W 4701253). In Wilhelm von Humboldt's 1 8 1 9 constitu­
tional plan for Prussia, it was similarly provided that only the Crown
could initiate legislation, but the Estates were to have the power of
veto over legislation generally; there were special provisions regarding
consent to taxation by the Estates and for the rejection of a govern­
mental administration by the Estates (cf. below, § 301, note 2)
(Wilhelm von Humboldt, 'Denkschrift tiber PreuBens standische
Verfassung ( 1 8 1 9)', Gesammelte Schriftell XII. I , ed. Bruno Gebhardt
(Berlin: Behr, 1 904), §§ 23-42, pp. 23 6-243).

§ 30!
I In Hegel's day, the voting franchise throughout Europe (where it
existed at all) was not only limited to males, but further restricted by

Notes to pages 340-342
property or occupational qualifications. Among those (such as Hegel)
who advocated the introduction of representative institutions where
they had not previously existed, all but the most radical favoured such
electoral qualifications. In the proposed constitution for Wiirttem­
berg, for instance, voters had to be twenty-five years of age and have
an income of at least zoo guilders from real property (L W 4701253).
Hegel supported this provision, regarding the property qualification
as 'insignificant' (L W 481126z). Kant argues that eligibility for
'active' citizenship should be restricted to those who are, by occupa­
tion, 'their own masters'; this is intended to exclude not only all
women and children, but also all servants, wage labourers and tenant
farmers (R L § 46, 3 13-3 1 5/78-80). The main reason for all such
restrictions on the franchise was the idea that those who are economi­
cally dependent on others would therefore be obliged to vote in a
manner prescribed by their patrons, and so there would be no point in
extending the franchise to them.
z In his Heidelberg lectures of 1 8 1 7- 1 8 1 8, Hegel maintains that the
government must always have the support of the majority party in the
Estates, and that there must also be an opposition party (apparently
after the English model):
Hence there must always be an opposition within the Estates
assembly; the ministry must be in the majority in an Estates
assembly, but the existence of an opposition is equally necessary .
. . If in general the ministry is in the minority, then another
ministry must step into the place of this ministry, and it can hold
its place only as long as it in general has the majority for it.
(VP R I 7 1 87)

§ 302
1 Compare the following remarks from Hegel's Encyclopaedia:
The aggregate of private persons is often spoken of as the
'people': but as such an aggregate it is vulgus, not populus: and in
this regard the principal aim of the state should be that the people
should not exist or come to power and action, as such an aggregate.
That condition of the people is a condition of lawlessness,
unethicality, brutishness: in it the people is only a shapeless, wild,
blind force.

§303
In the constitutional projects of Stein, and the later proposal of
Wilhelm von Humboldt, representatives were to be deputies of cor­
porations, not of geographical districts (Humboldt, 'Denkschrift',
Gesammelte Schriftetl XI! . I , § § 6 1-62, pp. 252-253). In Hardenberg's
constitutional proposal, the deputies to the general Estates were to be
chosen from and by the provincial Estates assemblies, but the latter
were representatives of corporations (Hardenberg, 'Verfassungsent­
wurf fiir PreuBen vom 3 . Mai 1 8 1 9 in Form eines Kg!. Kabinetsbe­
feWes', printed in Alfred Stem, Gescllicllte Europas 18IS-1871 I
(Berlin: Hertz, 1894), pp. 649-653.) One of Hegel's criticisms of the
English system of representation generally, and of the English Reform
Bill of 1 83 I in particular, was the fact that Members of Parliament
were elected from geographical districts; there was nothing to ensure
that voters would have social or economic solidarity with their
representatives. Under these circumstances, Hegel thought, exten­
sion of the franchise has chiefly the effect of alienating voters from the
political process by making each individual vote that much less signifi­
cant (RB I I 3/3 1 8).
§ 3IO
I

In the constitutional proposal for Wiirttemberg, there were no prop­
erty qualifications for deputies, but eligibility was restricted by age
(thirty years minimum) and religion (deputies had to be members of
either the Catholic, Lutheran, or Calvinist Churches). Further,
Crown officials, clergy, physicians, and lawyers were all barred from
serving as deputies (L W 4691252). Hegel does not comment on the
age or religious qualifications, but he endorses the occupational
restrictions, especially the prohibition against lawyers. He quotes
Napoleon's remark that lawyers are 'the people most unfitted to
advise on and ttansact public business' (L W 4731256). Hegel's advo­
cacy of these restrictions and of property qualifications reflects the
opinion that deputies to the Estates should be genuine representatives
of the people (that is, members of the specific professions and cor­
porations they represent); they should not be professional politicians.

§3I2
I

Like Hegel's theory of representation here, both Hardenberg's and
Humboldt's constitutional plans called for a bicameral Estates assem­
bly, with an 'upper house' (analogous to the British House of Lords)

composed of the hereditary nobility (Humboldt, 'Denkschrift',
Gesa11l1llelte Schrifiel/ XII. I, 60, p. 252; Hardenberg, 'Verfassungsent­
wurf, Stem, Gesclzichte Europas I, p. 650). The constitutional proposal
for Wiirttemberg, however, was unicameral; it provided fifty-three
seats for the nobility and seventy-three for elected representatives
(L W 47 11254).

Compare the follo\ving remarks from Hegel's lectures on world
history:
The spirit's inward development has outgrown the world it
inhabits, and it is about to progress beyond it. Its self-conscious­
ness no longer finds satisfaction in the present, but its dissatisfac­
tion has not yet enabled it to discover what it wants . . . World­
historical individuals are those who were the first to formulate the

2 After a Roman victory, it became customary to hold a 'triumph' (a
triumphal procession celebrating the conquest and honouring the
general). The most prominent example of what Hegel refers to is
Suetonius' description of the behaviour of Julius Caesar's soldiers
during his triumph after his victories over Gaul. Caesar had recently
given preferments to a man named Nicomedes in gratitude for his
sexual favours. DUring Caesar's triumph, his soldiers are supposed to

juxtapose Caesar's glorious conquest with the rather less glorious
conquest of Caesar himself by Nicomedes:
Caesar did subdue the Gauls, and him did Nicomedes subdue.
Behold how Caesar triumphs, who did the Gauls subdue.
But Nicomedes does not triumph, though he Caesar did subdue.
(Suetonius, Gaius Julius Caesar 49)

§ 322
1 Hegel's high praise for the modern nation state has given him the
reputation of being a cultural nationalist. But from what Hegel says
here in § 3 22R, it is clear that despite what both some of his Prussian
interpreters and liberal enemies have maintained, he would not have
looked favourably on the swallowing up of the smaller German states
(including his own homeland of Wiirttemberg) by Prussia, as
occurred later in the nineteenth century. Unlike Fries, he did not
advocate that the various German nations should form a political
union; in fact, he was generally opposed to this. See Franz
Rosenzweig, Hegel zmd der Staat II (Berlin: Oldenburg, 1920), p. 168
and Shlomo Avineri, Hegel's Theory of the Modem State (Cambridge
University Press, 1972), pp. 45-46, 79-80, 240-241. Nevertheless,
Hegel's views about the relationship between the cultural and political
realms were not inflexible: 'Small states can be united into a larger
one, if this larger state formed out of them is well organized' (VPR IV,
732).

§324
1 Cf. N R 48 1/93 . The reference to 'perpetual peace' is an allusion to
Kant, E F. Hegel's metaphor of the winds over the sea seems also to
be an allusion to a remark by the French statesman, econOInist, and
philosopher of history Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727-1 78 1 ),
whose views concerning the effects of war on human progress were
well-known:
War desolates only the frontier of empires; [in war], towns and
country places continue to breathe in the bosom of peace; the ties
of society unite a greater number of men; the communication of
ideas becomes more prompt and further spread; the arts,
sciences, and manners make progress at a more rapid rate. Thus
like the storm which agitates the waves of the sea, the evils
inseparable from revolutions disappear, the good remains and
humanity perfects itself.

of Arcot in India. At twenty-six, he was not an experienced officer and
he had only 500 soldiers to defend the citadel against 1 8,000 men, led
by Raja Chandra Sahib, nawab of Camatic. Mter fifty days, Clive had
only about 3 20 men left and Raja Sahib decided to storm the fort.
Mter one hour, the attackers retreated, having lost over 400 men,
while Clive had lost only six. The siege was then lifted, and Clive had
begun making his legendary reputation as a British military hero in
India.

Cf. Hegel's earlier description of war, and the effect of the introduc­
tion of firearms on the attitude of soldiers:
The military estate and war are the actual sacrifice of the self the danger of death for the individual, his looking at his abstract
h,'nmediate negativity, just as he is his immediate positive self . . .
The end is the maintenance of the totality, against the enemy who
is out to destroy it. This extemalization must have this same
al?stract form, must be without individuality - death, coldly
received and given, not in a standing fight where each individual
looks his opponent in the eye and kills him out of immediate
hatred, but instead by giving and receiving death emptily, imper­
sonally, out of the smoke of gunpowder.

2 William Pitt 'the Younger' (1759-I 806) became Prime Minister of
England in 1 783 . Personally, Pitt was initially disposed toward peace
with the French Republic, but in 1 793, after the execution of Louis
XVl, he yielded to popular sentiment (and the urgings of such foes of
the Revolution as Edmund Burke). Organizing a coalition of states
(including Holland, Spain, and Portugal), he attempted to bring down
the revolutionary Republic ('War of the First Coalition'). The coa­
lition soon dissolved, and the war was effectively ended by the Peace
of Campo Formio in April I 797 (to which, however, the British were
not a party). In 1 798 Pitt attempted to assemble a new coalition,
enlisting Russia and Austria as allies ('War of the Second Coalition').
But once again the effort was unsuccessful; Russia withdrew in I 799
and Austria agreed to a separate peace at Luneville in 1 80 ! . By that
time, Pitt's war policy had become extremely unpopular in England,
and he resigned as Prime Minister in I 80! .

Cf. The following famous passage from Rousseau's second discourse:
[It is] the faculty of self-perfection, which, by the help of
circumstances, gradually develops all the rest of our faculties, and
is inherent as much in the species as in the individual. It would be

melancholy were we forced to admit that this distinctive and
almost unlimited faculty is the source of all human misfortunes;

that it is this which, in time, draws man out of his original state, in

which he would have spent his days insensibly in peace and
innocence; that it is this faculty, which, successively producing in
different ages his discoveries and his errors, his vices and his

virtues, makes him at length a tyrant both over himself and over
nature.

The business of spirit is to produce itself, to make itself its own

object, and to gain knowledge of itself; in this way, it exists for
itself . . . The spirit produces and realizes itself in the light of its

knowledge of itself; it acts in such a way that all its knowledge of
itself is also realized. Thus everything depends on spirit's self­
awareness; if the spirit knows that it is free, it is altogether dif­
ferent from what it would be without this knowledge . . . The aim
of world history, therefore, is that spirit should attain knowledge

of its own true nature, that it should objectivize this knowledge
and transfonn it into a real world, and give itself an objective
existence.
(VG 5 6, 74148, 64)

KnoTlJ thyself, this absolute commandment, considered either in
itself or where its expression first occurred historically, does not
have the significance merely of a self-knowledge in respect of the
particular self's capacities, character, inclinations and weaknesses;
rather, its significance is the knowledge of the truth of humanity
and the true in and for itself, of the eSSe1lce of spirit . . . The
demand for self-knowledge made by the Delphic Apollo on the
Greeks thus does not have the meaning of a law imposed on the
human spirit externally by an alien power; on the contrary, the
god who impels us to self-knowledge is nothing other than the
absolute law of spirit itself.

Compare the following remarks from Hegel's lectures on the philo­
sophy of world history:
World history moves on a higher plane than that to which
morality properly belongs, for the sphere of morality is that of
private convictions, the conscience of individuals, and their own
particular will and mode of action; and the latter have their value,
imputation and reward or punishment within themselves.
Whatever is required and accomplished by the ultimate end of
the spirit, which exists in and for itself, and whatever providence
does, transcends the obligations, liability and responsibility which
attach to individuality by virtue of its ethical existence. Those
who, on ethical grounds (and hence with a noble intention), have
resisted what the progress of the Idea of the spirit required, stand
higher in moral worth than those whose crimes have been trans­
fonned by a higher order into the instruments of realizing its will .
But in revolutions of this kind, both parties alike stand within the
same circle of corruptible existence, so that it is merely a fonnal
kind of justice, abandoned by the living spirit and by God, which
those who have the existing law on their side defend. The deeds
of the great men who are the individuals of world history thus
appear justified not only in their inner significance (of which the
individuals in question are unconscious) but also in a secular
sense. But from this latter point of view, no representations
477

Notes to pages 374-375
should be made against world historicai deeds and those who
perform them by moral circles to which such individuals do not
belong. The litany of private virtues - modesty, humility, charity,
liberality, etc. - must not be raised against them.

1 Compare the following remarks from Hegel's lectures on the philo­
sophy of world history:
The nation must know the universal on which its ethlcal life is
based and before which the particular vanishes away, and it must
therefore know the determinations which underlie its justice and
religion . . . This spiritual self-consciousness is the nation's

p

su reme achievement . . . The nation now has both a real and an
ideal existence. At such a time, we shall therefore find that the
nation derives satisfaction from the idea of virtue and from dis­
cussion of it - discussion which may either coexist with virtue
itself or become a substitute for it. All this is the work of the
spirit, which knows how to bring the unreflected

i.e. the merely

factual - to the point of reflecting on itself. It thereby becomes
conscious to some degree of the limitation of such determinate
things as belief, trust and custom, so that the consciousness now
has reasons for renouncing the latter and the laws which they
impose. This is indeed the inevitable result of any search for
reasons . . . This dissolving activity of thought also inevitably gives
rise to a new principle . . . Spirit, in its new inward determination,
has new interests and ends beyond those which it formerly pos­
sessed.

I Peter Feddersen Stuhr (1787-185 1), under the pseudonym Feodor
Eggo, wrote Untergang der Natllrstaaten (The Downfoll ofNatural States)
(Berlin: Salfeld, 1 8 1 2). This work was a discussion, in the form of
letters, of Barthold Georg Niebuhr ( I 776-I 8 3 i), Critical History of
Rome (181 I).
§ 358

I Compare the following remarks from Hegel's lectures on the philo­
sophy of world history:
External unhappiness has to become a sorrow of the human
being within himself: he has to feel himself as the negative of
himself, he has to see that his unhappiness is an unhappiness of
his nature, that he is within himself a separated and divided
being. This vocation of self-chastisement, sorrowing over one's
own nothingness, one's own wretchedness, the longing to go
beyond this condition of inwardness, is to be sought elsewhere
than in the Roman world. This vocation is what gives the Jewish
people its world-historical significance and importance. For from
it the higher [spirit] has arisen, spirit has come to absolute self­
consciousness, since it is reflected out of its otherness, which is
(VP G 3 8 8/32 1)
its division and sorrow.
2 Hegel's use of 'Germanic' (gennanisch) is very broad in its reference: it
. includes 'Germany proper' (das eigentliche Deutsch/ami) - which Hegel
understands to include the Franks, the Normans, and the peoples of
England and Scandinavia (VP G 42 1/349). But it also encompasses
the 'Romanic' peoples of France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal (in which
he includes not only the Lombards and Burgundians, but also the
Visigoths and Ostrogoths) (VP G 420/348). The Germanic world
even includes the Magyars and the Slavs of Eastern Europe (VP G
479

Notes to pages 379-380
422/3 50). But the prominence he gives both to Tacitus' image of the
Teutonic character and to the Lutheran Reformation indicates that
Hegel gives a prominent role in the development of the modern spirit
to German culture in a narrower sense (cf. Tacitus, Gennany in
Agricola, Gennany, Dialogue 011 Orators, ed. Herbert W. Benario
(Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1 967), pp. 37-65; DV 465-467/146I SO , 532-533/z02-203; V P G 494141 4).

§359
I

Hegel sees the Christian Middle Ages as a time of self-alienation,
whose deepest form consists in the sense of separation between the
social realm, which is seen as belonging to a fallen world of finitude
and evil, and the individual human personality, which is destined for
an otherworldly spiritual realm (cf. PhG �� 487).

§36o
I

Elsewhere Hegel identifies the French Revolution as the event which
'brings heaven down to earth' (phG � 5 8 1). See § 5 , note 3 .

Glossary
An asterisk denotes those English tenns which are followed, in the

text, by the original Gennan tenn in square brackets. Where the
English tenn in question occurs more than once in any one of Hegel's
numbered paragraphs (including its appendages) or in the Preface,
the Gennan original is nonnally supplied only on the first occurrence,
unless the interval between occurrences is so long as to justifY its
repetition.
