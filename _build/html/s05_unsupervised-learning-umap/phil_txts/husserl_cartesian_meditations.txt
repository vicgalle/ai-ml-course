Translator's note: Sometimes Husserl uses Ego and Ich to express different
homophony of I and eye makes the English noun I intolerable, Ich
has been translated as Ego (spelled with a capital) and Ego has been translated as
ego (spelled with a small letter).
2 Translator's note: Husserl
frequently uses the words Gegenstand and Qbjekt to
express importantly different senses. Having found no acceptable alternative to
translating them both as object, I differentiate by spelling this word with a small
letter when it represents Gegenstand and with a capital when it represents Objekt.
All this applies, mutatis mutandis, in the case of any word derived from Gegenstand
or Objekt. If the English word object, or a word derived from it, stands first in a
sentence, the German word is given in brackets.

In this unhappy present, is not our situation similar to the

self-responsibility has been lost ?

conceivable freedom from prejudice, shaping itself with actual
autonomy according to ultimate evidences it has itself produced,

must not this defundamental

of the

sense of genuine philosophy? In recent times the
longing for a
fully alive philosophy has led to many a renaissance. Must not
the only fruitful renaissance be the one that reawakens the

impulse of the Cartesian Meditations: not to adopt their content
but, in not doing so, to renew with greater intensity the radicalness of their spirit, the radicalness of
self-responsibility, to

make

<48

that radicalness true for the first time

the last degree, / to uncover thereby for the first time the
genuine
sense of the necessary regress to the ego, and
to

overcome the hidden but already

felt

naivet6 of earlier phi-

losophizing ?

In any case, the question indicates one of the
ways that has
led to transcendental
phenomenology.
Along that way we now intend to walk together. In a quasiCartesian fashion we intend, as
radically beginning philosophers,
to carry out meditations with the utmost critical
and

precaution
a readiness for any
even the most far-reaching
transformation of the old-Cartesian meditations. Seductive
aberrations,
into which Descartes and later thinkers
strayed, will have to be
clarified and avoided as we
pursue our course.

When we proceed thus, fundamental components of the final
idea governing all scientific doing come immediately to the fore.
For example, the scientist intends, not merely to judge, but to
ground his judgments. Stated more precisely: He intends to let
no judgment be accepted by himself or others as "scientific
knowledge", unless he has grounded it perfectly and can therefore

Strasser reports that the passage rendered

apodictic evidence ..." includes emendations
given by Strasser may be rendered as follows:

by the sentences beginning with "An
made by Fink. The earlier wording

"An apodictic evidence, however, has
the signal peculiarity that the certainty of the being of what is beheld in it discloses
itself, to a critical reflection, as an absolute unimaginableness (inconceivability) of
the seen object's non-being and therefore of that object's being dubitable. [Blank
space for a word] the evidence of that critical reflection likewise has this dignity of
being apodictic. And the same is true at every level of critical reflection and also
with respect to always possible apodictic reflections." (Translator's note: The
thought underlying the phrase, "with respect to always possible apodictic reflections", may be that one can see apodictically that apodictic reflective insight into
the apodicticity of any apodictic reflective evidence is always possible.)

marginal note: From here Fink, (Translator's note: Strasser comments:
"Yet 6 already shows numerous improvements by Eugen Fink's hand." The improvements to which Strasser refers were made before the French translation (1931).

The question

for the factual existence of the world not apodietic;
inclusion in the Cartesian overthrow,

of evidences that are first in themselves

can
apparently be answered without any trouble. Does not the
existence of the world present itself forthwith as such an evidence ?

The life of everyday action relates to the world. All the sciences
relate to it: the sciences of matters of fact relate to it immediately; the apriori sciences, mediately, as instruments of scienmethod. More than anything else the being of the world is
obvious. It is so very obvious that no one would think of astific

serting it expressly in a proposition. After all, we have our
continuous experience in which this world
incessantly stands
before our eyes, as existing without question. But, however
much this evidence is prior in itself to all the < other > evidences
of life (as turned toward the world) and to all the evidences of
all the world sciences
(since it is the basis that continually

in
this

can lay claim to being apodictic. And,
which,
capacity,
if we follow up this doubt, it becomes manifest that our experiential evidence of the world lacks also the superiority of
being the absolutely primary evidence. Concerning the first
point, we note that the universal sensuous experience in whose
evidence the world is continuously given to us beforehand is
obviously not to be taken forthwith as an apodictic evidence,
which, as such, would absolutely exclude both the possibility of
eventual doubt whether the world is actual and the
possibility
of its non-being. Not only can a particular
experienced thing
suffer devaluation as an illusion of the senses; the whole unltarily surveyable nexus, experienced throughout a period of
time, can prove to be an illusion, a coherent dream. We need not
take the indicating of these possible and sometimes actual reversals of evidence as a sufficient criticism of the evidence in
question and see in it a full proof that, in spite of the continual
experiencedness of the world, a non-being of the world is conceivable. We shall retain only this much: that the evidence of
world-experience would, at all events, need to be criticized with
regard to its validity and range, before it could be used for the
purposes of a radical grounding of science, and that therefore

it is a matter of that Ego who grasps himself after he has deprived the experienced world of acceptance, because it might
be doubtful. After our differentiations, it is clear that the sense
of the indubitability with which the ego becomes given by
transcendental reduction actually conforms to the concept of

here one of those seemingly trivial nuances / that make a decisive difference between right and wrong paths of philosophy.
It must be continually borne in mind that all transcendentalphenomenological research is inseparable from undeviating observance of the transcendental reduction, which must not be
confounded with the abstractive restricting of anthropological

research to purely psychic life. Accordingly the difference between the sense of a psychological, and that of a transcendental-

phenomenological, exploration of consciousness is immeasurably
profound, though the contents to be described on the one hand

and on the other can correspond. In the one case we have data

other case the parallel data, with their like contents, are not
taken in this manner, because the whole world, when one is in
the phenomenological attitude, is not accepted as actuality, but
only as an actuality-phenomenon.

is avoided, there remains

turn, a first great domain of problems. Those processes are to

possible, as the latter can gain access to its genuine and truly
infinite field of problems only by that method.
At first, to be sure, the possibility of a pure phenomenology
of consciousness seems highly questionable, since the realm of
phenomena of consciousness is so truly the realm of a Heraclitean flux. It would in fact be hopeless to attempt to proceed

fashion concerning intentionality, concerning its peculiar synthesis, and so forth, relate to that type. In the particularization of

that type, and of its description, the intentional object (on the
side belonging to the cogitatum) plays, for easily understood
reasons, the role of "transcendental clue" to the typical infinite
multiplicities of possible cogitationes that, in a possible synthesis,

bear the intentional object within them (in the manner peculiar
to consciousness) as the same meant object. Necessarily the point
of departure is the object given "straightforwardly" at the particular time. From it reflection goes back to the mode of
consciousness at that time and to the potential modes of
consciousness included horizonally in that mode, then to those
in which the object might be otherwise intended as the same,
within the unity (ultimately) of a possible conscious life, all the
possibilities of which are included in the "ego". If we continue
to limit ourselves to the most extreme universality, to formal
universality, if we think of just any object (with an unrestrictedly
optional content) as cogitatum, and take it in this universality as
our clue, we find that the multiplicity of possible modes of

evidences relating to the object and belonging together in such

we have touched the level of genetic phenomenology. Before we

precise sense of genetic

phenomenology, a

renewed meditation concerning phenomenological method is needed.
At last we must bring to b^ar a fundamental methodological
insight, which, once it is grasped, pervades the whole phenomenological

method (and likewise, in the natural realm, the method
and pure internal psychology). We have delayed

The excessively great multiplicity of novel discoveries and

description, however, signifies a transfer of all empirical descriptions into a

at the
beginning would have increased the difficulties of understanding;
on the other hand, it is easy to grasp after a considerable number
of empirical x descriptions.

liking something, striving for it, and so forth) and think of it as
explicated and described in respect of its sort of intentional
performance
accordingly: in respect of noesis and noema.

This can signify (and so we have understood it up to now) that
types of de facto occurences in the de facto transcendental ego
are in question and that the transcendental descriptions are
therefore meant to have an "empirical" significance. But in-

voluntarily we confined our description to such a universality
that its results remain unaffected, regardless of what the situation
may be with respect to the empirical factualness of the transcen-

dental ego.
Let us make this clear to ourselves, and then fruitful for our

method. Starting from this table-perception as an example, we
vary the perceptual object, table, with a completely free optionalness, yet in such a manner that we keep perception fixed as
perception of something, no matter what. Perhaps we begin by

Thus the problem is stated at first as a special one,
namely /
<i24>that of the "thereness-for~rne" of others, and
accordingly as the
theme of a transcendental theory of experiencing someone else, a
transcendental theory of so-called "empathy". But it soon becomes evident that the range of such a theory is much greater
than at first it seems, that it contributes to the
founding of a
transcendental theory of the Objective world and, indeed, to the

founding of such a theory in every respect, notably as regards
Objective Nature. The existence-sense [Seinssinn} of the world

and

of

Nature

in particular, as

Objective Nature, includes after

all, as we have already mentioned, thereness-for-everyone. This
is always coint ended whereever we
speak of Objective actuality.

In addition, Objects with "spiritual" predicates belong to the
experienced world. These Objects, in respect of their origin and
sense, refer us to subjects, usually other subjects, and their
actively constituting intentionality. Thus it is in the case of all

cultural Objects (books, tools, works of any kind, and so
forth),
which moreover carry with them at the same time the experiential sense of thereness-for-everyone (that is, everyone
belonging
to the corresponding cultural community, such as the

community,

In this connexion we note something important. When we
thus abstract, we retain a unitarily coherent stratum of the phenomenon world, a stratum of the phenomenon that is the corre-

harmonious, continuing world-experience.
Despite our abstraction, we can go on continuously in our experiencing intuition, while remaining exclusively in the aforesaid
stratum. This unitary stratum, furthermore, is distinguished

to say: I

obviously cannot have the "alien" or "other" as experience, and
therefore cannot have the sense "Objective world" as an experiential sense, without having this stratum in actual experience; whereas the reverse is not the case.

Let us observe more closely the result of our abstraction and,
accordingly, what it leaves us. From the phenomenon world,

from the world appearing with an Objective sense, a substratum
becomes separated, as the "Nature" included in my ownness, a
Nature that must always be carefully distinguished from
that is to say: from the Nature that
Nature, pure and simple
becomes the theme of the natural scientist. This Nature, to be
sure, is likewise a result of abstraction, namely abstraction from
everything psychic and from those predicates of the Objective
world that have arisen from persons. But what is acquired by
this abstraction on the part of the natural scientist is a stratum
that belongs to the Objective world itself (viewed in the transcendental attitude, a stratum that belongs to the objective sense:
just as,
"Objective world") and is therefore itself Objective
on the other hand, what is abstracted from is Objective (the
Objective psychic, Objective cultural predicates, and so forth).

must not by any means be taken

for an abstract stratum of the
world or of the world's sense. Among the bodies belonging to
this "Nature" and included in my peculiar ownness, I then find
my animate organism as uniquely singled out
namely as the
only one of them that is not just a body but precisely an animate
organism: the sole Object within my abstract world-stratum to
which, in accordance with experience, I ascribe fields of sensation

a field of
(belonging to it, however, in different manners
tactual sensations, a field of warmth and coldness, and so forth),
the only Object "in" which I "rule and govern" immediately,

governing particularly in each of its "organs". Touching kinesthetically, I perceive "with" my hands; seeing kinesthetically,
I perceive also "with" my eyes; and so forth; moreover I can
perceive thus at any time. Meanwhile the kinesthesias pertaining
to the organs flow in the mode "I am doing", and are subject to
my "I can" furthermore, by calling these kinesthesias into play,
I can push, thrust, and so forth, and can
thereby "act" somatically
immediately, and then mediately. As perceptively active,
I experience (or can experience) all of Nature, including my own
animate organism, which therefore in the process is reflexively
related to itself. That becomes possible because I "can" perceive
one hand "by means of" the other, an eye by means of a hand,
a procedure in which the functioning organ must
and so forth
become an Object and the Object a functioning organ. And it is the

My own ego however, the ego given

mine. That which is primordially
incompatible, in simultaneous
coexistence, becomes compatible: because my primordial

constitutes the ego who is other for him
by an appresentative
apperception, which, according to its intrinsic nature, never
is open to fulfilment
by presentation.

that we understand "presenting" in a broader sense.
Let us apply this general cognition to the case of
experiencing
someone else. In this case too it should be noted that experience
can appresent only because it presents, that here too appresentation
can exist only in the aforesaid functional community with
presentation. That implies, however, that, from the very beginning, what this experience presents must belong to the unity of
the very object appresented. In other words: It is not, and cannot
be, the case that the body belonging to

of the other primordial sphere or the other concrete
ego) could
appresent his factual existence and being-there-too, unless this

primordial body acquired the sense, "a body belonging to the
other ego", and, according to the whole associative-apperceptive
performance, the sense: "someone else's animate organism itself'.

Therefore

not as though the body over there, in my primordial sphere, remained separate from the animate bodily
organism of the other Ego, as if that body were something like

On

which they are constituted as monads, existing for themselves

absolutely separate unity, the "irreal" intentional reaching of
the other into my primordiality is not irreal in the sense of being

dreamt into it or being present to consciousness after the fashion
of a mere phantasy. Something that exists is in intentional communion with something else that exists. It is an essentially unique
connectedness, an actual community and precisely the one that
makes transcendentally possible the being of a world, a world
of men and things.
After the first level of communalization and (this being almost
equivalent) the first constitution of an Objective world, starting
from the primordial world, have been sufficiently clarified, the
higher levels offer relatively minor difficulties. Though comprehensive investigations and a progressive differentiation of
problems relating to these levels are necessary for purposes of an
all-round explication, here we can be satisfied with rough general
indications, easily understandable on the basis already laid.
Starting from me, from the one who is constitutionally the primal
monad, I acquire what are for me other monads and, correlatively, others as psychophysical subjects. This implies that I do

On this basis it is not hard to clear up the necessary parallel

earlier, the pure psyche is a self-Objectivation of the monad,
a self-Objectivation the different

the other hand, what we have here is anything but metaphysics

in the customary sense: a historically degenerate metaphysics,

they can become problems to work on.

In this connexion we are again reminded of the problems

the "idea of time", the "idea of a physical thing"
problems
dealt with so often in the last century by the most distinguished
physiologists and psychologists. Much as the great projects bore
the stamp of their distinguished authors, no actual clarification
has as yet been attained.
When we turn from them to the set of problems that we have
delimited and fitted into the phenomenological system of levels,
it is evident that the whole of modern psychology and episte-

mology has failed to grasp the proper sense of the problems to
be set here, both psychologically and transcendentally

as intentional processes. There was a lack of understanding for
the peculiar character of an intentional "analysis" and all the

tasks disclosed

by

consciousness as such, in respect of noesis and

methods these tasks require. About problems that concern the

has misled and paralysed the whole of modern philosophy.
As in the case of transcendental phenomenology, so also in
the parallel case of intentional psychology (as a "positive"
science) our exposition has manifestly predelineated a fundamental structure, a division of the corresponding investigations
of eidetic psychology into those that explicate intentionally

what is included in the concrete own-essentiality of any psyche
whatever and those that explicate the intentionality pertaining
to the otherness that becomes constituted therein. To the former
sphere of research belongs the chief and fundamental part of the

all,

exclusion

As an

initial problem concerning the psychological
origin of the
experiential world, there emerges here the problem concerning
the origin of the "thing-phantom", or "thing pertaining to the
senses", with its strata (sight thing, <touch thing, > and so forth)

and

their synthetic unity. The thing-phantom is / given
(always <172>
within the limits set by this primordial reduction) purely as a

unity belonging to modes of sensuous appearance and their
syntheses. The thing-phantom, in its variants as "near thing"
and "far thing", all of which belong together synthetically, is
not yet the "real thing" of the primordial psychic sphere. Even
in this sphere the "real thing" becomes constituted at a higher
level, as a causal thing, an identical substrate of causal properties
(a "substance"). Obviously substance and causality indicate
constitutional problems of a higher level. The constitutional

problem of the thing pertaining to the senses, along with the
problem of the spatiality and temporality that are fundamentally essential to it, is precisely the problem just now indicated. It is a problem of descriptive inquiry that concerns only
the synthetic complexes of thing-appearances (apparencies,
perspective aspects). Moreover, it is one-sided. The other side
concerns the relation of the appearances back to the functioning
aiiimate organism, which in turn must be described in respect
of its self-constitution

and the

signal peculiarity of its consti-

tutive system of appearances.

Let us return now, at the conclusion of this chapter, to the
objection by which at first we let ourselves be guided, the objection to our phenomenology, so far as, from the very beginning,
it claimed to be transcendental philosophy and, as such, to have
the ability to solve the problems that concern the possibility of
Objective knowledge. The objection runs as follows. Starting

from the transcendental ego of the phenomenological reduction
and thenceforth restricted to him, phenomenology is incapable
of solving those problems. Without admitting that it does so,
it lapses into a transcendental solipsism; and the whole step
leading to other subjectivity and to genuine Objectivity is
possible only by virtue of an unacknowledged metaphysics, a
concealed adoption of Leibnizian traditions. /

Our actual explications have dissipated the objection as

by the general requirement that the world and all I know about

Concluding word.

Our meditations, we may venture to say, have in the main
fulfilled their purpose, namely to show the concrete possibility
of the Cartesian idea 1 of a philosophy as an all-embracing
science grounded on an absolute foundation. To exhibit this
concrete possibility, to show the feasibility <of such a philosothough of course in the form of an endless program

means exhibiting a necessary and indubitable beginning and an
equally necessary and always employable method
whereby,
at the same time, a systematic order of all sensful problems is
predelineated. This much we have actually done. The only

Therefore a consequentially progressing phenomenology constructs a priori (yet with a strictly intuited essential necessity

In the case of concepts fashioned originarily in this manner,
there can be no paradoxes. This is true of all the fundamental
concepts that concern the concrete structure and the total
form of sciences that relate (or can become related)

to the various regions of being. Thus the investigations concerning the transcendental constitution of a world, which we

have roughly indicated

in these meditations, are precisely the
beginning of a radical clarification of the sense and origin (or of the
sense in consequence of the origin) of the concepts: world, Nature,

space, time, psychophysical being, man, psyche, animate organism,
social community, culture, and so forth. It is plain that the

actual carrying out of the indicated investigations would have
to lead to all the concepts which, as unexplored', function as

CONCLUSION

We

can now say likewise that, in apriori transcendental phenomenology, all apriori sciences without exception originate
with an ultimate grounding, thanks to its correlational research,
and that, taken with this origin, they belong within an all-embracing apriori phenomenology itself, as its systematically differentiated branches. This system of the all-embracing Apriori is
therefore to be designated also as the systematic unfolding of the
all-embracing Apriori innate in the essence of a transcendental
subjectivity (and consequently in that of a transcendental interor as the systematic unfolding of the universal

subjectivity)
