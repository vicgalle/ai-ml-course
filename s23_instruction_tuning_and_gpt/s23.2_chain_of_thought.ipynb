    "1. Define the task and success criteria: The first and most crucial step is to clearly define the specific task you want the model to perform. This could be anything from entity extraction, question answering, or text summarization to more complex tasks like code generation or creative writing. Once you have a well-defined task, establish the success criteria that will guide your evaluation and optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key success criteria to consider include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Performance and accuracy: How well does the model need to perform on the task?\n",
    "    * Latency: What is the acceptable response time for the model? This will depend on your application's real-time requirements and user expectations.\n",
    "    * Price: What is your budget for running the model? Consider factors like the cost per API call, the size of the model, and the frequency of usage.\n",
    "    Having clear, measurable success criteria from the outset will help you make informed decisions throughout the adoption process and ensure that you're optimizing for the right goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop test cases: With your task and success criteria defined, the next step is to create a diverse set of test cases that cover the intended use cases for your application. These should include both typical examples and edge cases to ensure your prompts are robust. Having well-defined test cases upfront will enable you to objectively measure the performance of your prompts against your success criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Engineer the preliminary prompt: Next, craft an initial prompt that outlines the task definition, characteristics of a good response, and any necessary context for the model. Ideally you should add some examples of canonical inputs and outputs for the model to follow. This preliminary prompt will serve as the starting point for refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test prompt against test cases: Feed your test cases into the model using the preliminary prompt. Carefully evaluate the model's responses against your expected outputs and success criteria. Use a consistent grading rubric, whether it's human evaluation, comparison to an answer key, or even another instance of the model’s judgement based on a rubric. The key is to have a systematic way to assess performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Refine prompt: Based on the results from step 4, iteratively refine your prompt to improve performance on the test cases and better meet your success criteria. This may involve adding clarifications, examples, or constraints to guide the model's behavior. Be cautious not to overly optimize for a narrow set of inputs, as this can lead to overfitting and poor generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ship the polished prompt: Once you've arrived at a prompt that performs well across your test cases and meets your success criteria, it's time to deploy it in your application. Monitor the model's performance in the wild and be prepared to make further refinements as needed. Edge cases may crop up that weren't anticipated in your initial test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this process, it's worth starting with the most capable model and unconstrained prompt length to establish a performance ceiling. Once you've achieved the desired output quality, you can then experiment with optimizations like shorter prompts or smaller models to reduce latency and costs as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this test-driven methodology and carefully defining your task and success criteria upfront, you'll be well on your way to harnessing the power of the model for your specific use case. If you invest time in designing robust test cases and prompts, you'll reap the benefits in terms of model performance and maintainability."
