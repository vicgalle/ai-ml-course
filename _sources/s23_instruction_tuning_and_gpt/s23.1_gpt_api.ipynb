    "# Instruction Tuning of Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP and ML have gone through several phases of how models are trained in recent years. With the arrival of pre-trained models such as BERT, fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks became the norm. The increasing capabilities of ever larger models then enabled in-context learning via prompting. Recently, instruction tuning has become the newest method to make LLMs useful in practice."

    "### What is Instruction Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between instruction tuning and standard supervised fine-tuning lies in the data that the model is trained on. Whereas supervised fine-tuning trains models on input examples and their corresponding outputs, instruction tuning augments input-output examples with instructions, which enables instruction-tuned models to generalize more easily to new tasks."
