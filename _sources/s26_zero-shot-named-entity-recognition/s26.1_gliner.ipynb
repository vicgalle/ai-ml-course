    "# GLiNER: Generalist and Lightweight Model for Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "GLiNER is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model capable of identifying any entity type using a transformer encoder (BERT-like). It provides a practical alternative to traditional NER models, which are limited to predefined entities, and Large Language Models (LLMs) that, despite their flexibility, are costly and large for resource-constrained scenarios.\n",
